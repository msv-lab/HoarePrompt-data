Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, and for each test case, the sequence `p` is a permutation of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10⁴.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to be an input integer within the specified range. The other variables (`t` and `p`) remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
