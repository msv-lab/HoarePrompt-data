The code snippet assigns the list `[i]` to the variable `pans`. Given that `mak` is the value of `i` and `mak2` is equal to the original `mak`, the value of `i` is essentially `mak`. Therefore, `pans` will now hold a list containing the value of `mak`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak` is the value of `i`, `mak2` is equal to the original `mak`, `pans` is a list containing the value of `mak`, `s` is the string `'<'`.**
