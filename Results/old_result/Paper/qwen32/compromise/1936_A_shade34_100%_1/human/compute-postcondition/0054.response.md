To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `len(pans)`.

Here's the given for loop:
```python
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, the range `(1, len(pans))` must contain at least one integer. This means `len(pans)` must be greater than 1 because the range starts from 1 and goes up to, but does not include, `len(pans)`. 

Let's break down the requirements:

- `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 1 when the loop starts.
- `len(pans)` must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop runs at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴.
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is equal to `mak` if the last input was `'<'`, otherwise it is the previous value of `mak`.
- `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` where the input was `'='`, and the last index `i` where the input was `'<'` (if any).

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of `pans` to have more than one element.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is equal to `mak` if the last input was `'<'`, otherwise it is the previous value of `mak`, and `pans` is a list containing at least two elements**.
