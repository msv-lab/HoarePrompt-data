The code snippet `pans = [i]` assigns the list containing the single element `i` to the variable `pans`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Given that `s` is equal to `<`, this detail does not affect the execution of the given code snippet directly, but it's part of the initial state and should be included in the output state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is `i`, `mak2` is the highest index i (from 1 to n-1) where the response was '<', `pans` is `[i]`, `s` is the string input from the user and `s` is equal to '<'.**
