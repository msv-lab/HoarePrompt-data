To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

The `for` loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means the loop will iterate over values of `i` starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1 because if `n` is 1 or less, the range `(1, n)` will be empty, and the loop will not run.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³
- `n` is the new input integer
- `mak` is 0
- `mak2` is equal to its previous value
- `pans` is unchanged

The only variable in the loop head that we can adjust to ensure the loop executes is `n`. The other variables (`t`, `mak`, `mak2`, `pans`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to influence the execution of the loop directly.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to set `n` to be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` must be greater than 1, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is equal to its previous value, and `pans` is unchanged**
