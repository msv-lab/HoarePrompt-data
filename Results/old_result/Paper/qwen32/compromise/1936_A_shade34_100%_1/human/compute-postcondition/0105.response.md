Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<', `mak2` is the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<'. If `s` is '=', `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`. Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list.**
