The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. Since the initial state specifies that `mak` is 0, after executing the line `mak = i`, `mak` will take the value of `i`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, and `pans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is `i`, `mak2` is unchanged, and `pans` contains all indices where the response was '=', or only the last index where the response was '<' if there was one. The current input is '<'.**
