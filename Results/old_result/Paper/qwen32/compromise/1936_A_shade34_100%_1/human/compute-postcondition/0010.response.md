Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `mak` is set to `i` if the input received is the string `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `mak`:**
   - `mak` is set to `i` if the input received is the string `'<'`.
   - If the input is not `'<'`, `mak` remains 0.
   - Since the exact input is not specified, we need to consider both possibilities:
     - If the input is `'<'`, then `mak = i`.
     - If the input is anything other than `'<'`, then `mak = 0`.

2. **Variable `i`:**
   - `i` is incremented by 1 before the print statement.
   - Therefore, the value of `i` in the print statement is the value it had before being incremented plus 1.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1:** If the input is `'<'`:
  - `mak = i`
  - `i` is incremented by 1, so the current value of `i` in the print statement is `i + 1`.
  - The print statement will output: `? i+1 i+1 i+1 i+1`

- **Scenario 2:** If the input is anything other than `'<'`:
  - `mak = 0`
  - `i` is incremented by 1, so the current value of `i` in the print statement is `i + 1`.
  - The print statement will output: `? 0 0 i+1 i+1`

Since the exact input is not specified, we need to account for both scenarios. However, the question asks for the most precise description possible based on the given information.

### Final Output:
Given the two scenarios, the most precise description is:

Output: **? mak mak i i (where mak is i if the input is '<', otherwise mak is 0, and i is incremented by 1 before the print statement)**
