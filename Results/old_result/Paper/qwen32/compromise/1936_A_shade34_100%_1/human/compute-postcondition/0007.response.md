The given code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, which means its value is unknown. Since `mak` was initially 0, it will now hold whatever value `i` has.

Given the initial conditions and the code execution, the output state would be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak` is `i`, and the input received is the string `'<'`.**

This means `mak` now holds the value of `i`, while `t`, `n`, and the input remain unchanged.
