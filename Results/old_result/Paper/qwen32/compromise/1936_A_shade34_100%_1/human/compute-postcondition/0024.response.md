The code snippet provided is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This command flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console immediately. However, this command does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the input was `'<'`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is an empty list**.
