To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³. This doesn't affect the current `print` statement directly.
- `n` is unchanged. The value of `n` is not specified, so it does not impact the current `print` statement.
- `mak2` is unchanged. The value of `mak2` is not specified, so it does not impact the current `print` statement.
- `pans` contains at least three elements. We don't know the specific values of these elements, but we know there are at least three.
- `i` is 3.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

Here, we need to identify the values of `mak` and `i` to determine what gets printed. From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is 3, so `pans[i]` refers to the fourth element of the `pans` list (since list indices start at 0).
- `mak` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value from the given information. Therefore, we'll denote the value of `mak` as `mak`.

Thus, the output will be:
- `'?'`: A literal question mark.
- `pans[mak]`: The element at index `mak` in the `pans` list.
- `pans[mak]`: Again, the element at index `mak` in the `pans` list.
- `pans[i]`: The element at index 3 in the `pans` list.
- `pans[i]`: Again, the element at index 3 in the `pans` list.

Since the exact values of `mak` and the elements in `pans` are not specified, we describe them symbolically.

Output: **? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[3] pans[3] (where mak is an index into the pans list and pans[3] is the fourth element of the pans list)**
