The given code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This command flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console immediately. However, it does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴
- `mak` is 0
- `mak2` is equal to `mak` if the last input was `'<'`, otherwise it is the previous value of `mak`
- `pans` is a list containing at least two elements

Since `sys.stdout.flush()` does not modify any variables, the values of `t`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is equal to `mak` if the last input was `'<'`, otherwise it is the previous value of `mak`, and `pans` is a list containing at least two elements.**
