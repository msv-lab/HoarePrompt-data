To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `mak` is initialized to 0.
- `mak2` is mentioned but its value is unchanged, so it does not affect the current `print` statement.
- `pans` contains all indices where the response was '=', or only the last index where the response was '<' if there was one.
- The `print` statement is `print('?', mak, mak, i, i)`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `mak` is explicitly set to 0.
- `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value from the given information. However, since `i` is used twice in the print statement, it will be printed twice with whatever value it holds at the time of execution.

Given this, the output will be:
- The string `'?'`.
- The value of `mak`, which is 0.
- The value of `mak` again, which is 0.
- The value of `i` (twice).

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we can only describe it as `i`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is the value of the variable i at the time of execution)**
