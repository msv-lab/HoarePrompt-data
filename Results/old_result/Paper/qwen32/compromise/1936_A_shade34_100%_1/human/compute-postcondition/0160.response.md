To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `mak2` is unchanged.
- `pans` contains all indices where the response was '=', or only the last index where the response was '<' if there was one.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- If the input is '<', `mak` is set to `i + 1`.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the loop definition, we know that `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`. After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

Since `n` is unchanged and determines the upper limit of the loop, it does not need adjustment.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is unchanged, `pans` contains all indices where the response was '=', or only the last index where the response was '<' if there was one, `i` is `i + 2`**.

Note: Since `i` was already incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to increment it by another 1 to get the correct starting value for the next iteration. Hence, `i` becomes `i + 2` relative to its initial value at the start of the previous iteration. However, if we consider the immediate state transition, `i` simply becomes the next integer in sequence, which is `i + 1` from its end-of-previous-iteration value.

Therefore, the precise state considering the immediate transition is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is unchanged, `pans` contains all indices where the response was '=', or only the last index where the response was '<' if there was one, `i` is `i + 1`**.
