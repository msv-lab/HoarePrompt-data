To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n`: An integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `mak2`: Equal to its previous value (implying it retains its value from a previous iteration or initialization).
- `mak`: Set to `i` if the input is `'>'`; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
- `pans`: A list containing at least two elements.
- `i`: Incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
1. **`pans[mak]`**: This will print the element at the index `mak` in the list `pans`. Since `mak` is set to `i` if the input is `'>'`, and otherwise remains unchanged, the value of `mak` depends on the previous operations. However, without specific values for `mak` and `pans`, we can only say that it refers to the element at index `mak` in the list `pans`.

2. **`pans[i]`**: This will print the element at the index `i` in the list `pans`. Given that `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`), the value of `pans[i]` refers to the element at the new index `i` in the list `pans`.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output a question mark followed by four elements from the list `pans`:
- The first two elements are the same and are the element at index `mak` in the list `pans`.
- The last two elements are the same and are the element at index `i` in the list `pans`.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where pans[mak] is the element at index mak in the list pans and pans[i] is the element at index i in the list pans)**
