Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴
- `mak` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the input was `'<'`
- `mak2` is equal to `mak`
- `pans` is an empty list
- `s` is the string input by the user and the current value of `s` is `'<'`

Code Snippet:
```python
mak = i
```

The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. However, the value of `i` is not defined in the given initial state. Since the problem does not specify what `i` is, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `mak` after the assignment. But we know that `mak` will take the value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak` is the value of `i`, `mak2` is equal to the original `mak`, `pans` is an empty list, `s` is the string `'<'`.**

In natural language: The value of `mak` is now the value of `i`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
