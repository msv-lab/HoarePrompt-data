Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the input was `'<'`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    s = str(input())
    if s == '<':
        mak = i
        pans = [i]
    elif s == '=':
        pans.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the input was `'<'`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `pans` is a list. If `s` is the string `'<'`, then `mak` is updated to the current index `i`, and `pans` contains the value of `mak`. If `s` is the string `'='`, then `pans` contains the value of `i`. Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the input was `'<'`, `mak2` is equal to `mak` if `s` is not `'<'`, otherwise `mak2` is the previous value of `mak`. `pans` is a list containing the current value of `i` if `s` is `'<'`, and if `s` is `'='`, `pans` contains the previous elements plus `i`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `s` is the string input from the user.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the input was `'<'`, `mak2` is equal to `mak` if `s` is not `'<'`, otherwise `mak2` is the previous value of `mak`, `pans` is a list containing the current value of `i` if `s` is `'<'`, and if `s` is `'='`, `pans` contains the previous elements plus `i`, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` is the string input from the user. If `s` is `'<'`, `mak` is updated to the current value of `i` and `pans` is reset to contain only the current value of `i`. If `s` is `'='`, `pans` includes the new value of `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
