The value of `mak` is explicitly set to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, and `pans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is unchanged, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is unchanged, and `pans` contains all indices where the response was '=', or only the last index where the response was '<' if there was one.**
