To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and their meanings:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
   - `n`: An integer between 2 and 10,000 (inclusive).
   - `mak`: The largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) where the input was `'<'`.
   - `mak2`: Initially set to the value of `mak`.
   - `pans`: A list (though its contents are not specified in the initial state).
   - `i`: Incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

2. **The print statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

Given the information, let's break down the values that will be printed:

- **`'?'`**: This is a literal string, so it will be printed as `'?'`.
- **`mak`**: This is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) where the input was `'<'`. Since the exact input sequence is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `mak`. However, we know it is an integer between 1 and `n-1`.
- **`mak2`**: This is initially set to the value of `mak`, so it will have the same value as `mak` unless modified later in the code. Since no modification is mentioned, `mak2` will also be the largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) where the input was `'<'`.
- **`i`**: This variable is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. Without knowing the initial value of `i` or the number of iterations, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `i`. However, we know it is an integer.

Since the exact values of `mak` and `i` depend on the input sequence and the number of iterations, we can only describe them in general terms.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] (where mak is the largest index i (from 1 to n-1) where the input was '<', mak2 is initially set to mak, and i is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration)**
