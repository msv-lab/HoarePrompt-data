Reasoning:  
1. The function `func()` first reads the input string `s` which is a balanced parentheses sequence.
2. It initializes a `balance` variable to keep track of the balance of the parentheses sequence as it iterates through the string.
3. For each character in the string, it updates the `balance` by adding 1 for an opening parenthesis '(' and subtracting 1 for a closing parenthesis ')'.
4. It records the balance, the negative index (to break ties in decreasing order of position), and the character itself in a list `details`.
5. It sorts the `details` list primarily by the balance (ascending) and secondarily by the negative index (descending), which ensures that ties in balance are broken by the original position in reverse order.
6. It constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `details` list.
7. Finally, it prints the result string.

The sorting step ensures that the resulting sequence has the properties of a balanced shuffle as described in the problem statement: the sequence is formed by rearranging the original sequence such that for every prefix of the new sequence, the balance is non-negative, and the overall balance is 0.

Thus, the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation.

Correctness: **True**
