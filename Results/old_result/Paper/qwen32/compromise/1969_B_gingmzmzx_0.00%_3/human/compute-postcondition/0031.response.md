The given code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value at index `c` in the list `cnt` by 1. Since `cnt` is initially `[0, 0]`, the value at index `c` will increase by 1.

Given the initial state, `c` is not explicitly defined in the problem statement. However, since `cnt` has only two elements (indices 0 and 1), `c` must be either 0 or 1.

Let's consider both cases:

1. If `c` is 0, then `cnt[0]` will be incremented by 1, making `cnt` equal to `[1, 0]`.
2. If `c` is 1, then `cnt[1]` will be incremented by 1, making `cnt` equal to `[0, 1]`.

Since the exact value of `c` is not specified, we cannot determine which element of `cnt` will be incremented. However, we know that one of the elements in `cnt` will be incremented by 1.

Other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a new list of integers derived from the input that must have at least 1 element, `n` is `n-1`, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the new list `s`, `cnt` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`, `ans` is 0**.
