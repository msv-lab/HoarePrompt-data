The value of `ans` is updated by adding the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]`. Since `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s` and `cnt[0]` is either 1 or 0, the new value of `ans` will be `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, and the length of `s` is at least 2, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is either [1, 0] or [0, 1], `ans` is `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])`, and `c` is not equal to 0.**
