The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value at index `c` of the list `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, `cnt` is initialized as `[0, 0]`. Since `c` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, based on the context, `c` is likely to be either 0 or 1 because the elements of the list `s` are either 0 or 1, and `cnt` is used to count occurrences of these values.

Let's consider both possibilities:

1. If `c` is 0, then `cnt[0]` will be incremented by 1, making `cnt` equal to `[1, 0]`.
2. If `c` is 1, then `cnt[1]` will be incremented by 1, making `cnt` equal to `[0, 1]`.

Since the exact value of `c` is not specified, we acknowledge both possibilities. The values of `t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, and the length of `s` is at least 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is either [1, 0] or [0, 1], `ans` is 0**.
