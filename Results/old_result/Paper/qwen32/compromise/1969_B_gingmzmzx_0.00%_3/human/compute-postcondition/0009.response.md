The code snippet increments `ans` by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0. Given that `cnt` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`, `cnt[1]` will be 1 in one case and 0 in the other. Therefore, `ans` will be incremented by 1 if `cnt` is `[1, 0]`, and it will remain unchanged if `cnt` is `[0, 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, and the length of `s` is at least 2, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is either [1, 0] or [0, 1], `ans` is 1 if `cnt` was [1, 0] else 0, and `c` is 0.**
