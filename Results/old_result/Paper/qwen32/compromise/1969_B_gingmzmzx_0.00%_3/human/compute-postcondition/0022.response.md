Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, and the length of `s` is at least 2, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is either [2, 0] if `c` was 0 or [0, 2] if `c` was 1, `c` is the next element in the list `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1] > 0`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is updated to its previous value plus (`zeroes - cnt[0]`).**
