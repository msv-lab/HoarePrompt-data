You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a binary string `s`. It then calculates and prints the number of valid (0, 1) pairs in the string `s`, where a valid pair is defined as a '0' that appears before any '1'. This process is repeated for each of the `n` test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to find the minimum total cost to make a binary string `s` sorted in non-descending order (i.e., all `0`s come before all `1`s). The allowed operation is a cyclic shift of any substring, and the cost of this operation is the length of the substring.

### Program Analysis
Here is the provided program:
```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)
```

#### Explanation of the Code
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Counting Zeroes**: For each string `s`, it counts the total number of zeroes.
3. **Counting and Cost Calculation**:
   - It initializes a counter array `cnt` to keep track of the number of `0`s and `1`s encountered so far.
   - It iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`.
   - If `c` is `0` and there has been at least one `1` encountered (`cnt[1] > 0`), it adds `1` to the cost `ans`.
   - If `c` is `1`, it adds the number of remaining zeroes (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to the cost `ans`.

#### Verification Against Problem Description
The logic in the program seems to be based on the idea that the cost to sort the string is determined by the number of inversions (where a `1` appears before a `0`). However, the specific calculation in the program does not directly align with the described operation costs and does not guarantee the minimum cost to sort the string using cyclic shifts.

### Potential Issues
- **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The program does not correctly calculate the cost of performing cyclic shifts to sort the string. The cost should reflect the actual operations needed to move all `1`s to the end, which involves considering the length of the substrings being shifted.
- **Edge Cases**: The program might not handle edge cases correctly, such as strings with all `0`s or all `1`s, or strings where the `0`s and `1`s are already in the correct order.

### Test Case Verification
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:
1. **First Test Case**: `s = "10"`
   - Expected Output: `2` (Shift the entire string once).
   - Program Output: `1` (Incorrect).
2. **Second Test Case**: `s = "0000"`
   - Expected Output: `0` (Already sorted).
   - Program Output: `0` (Correct).
3. **Third Test Case**: `s = "11000"`
   - Expected Output: `9` (Multiple shifts required).
   - Program Output: `4` (Incorrect).
4. **Fourth Test Case**: `s = "101011"`
   - Expected Output: `5` (Multiple shifts required).
   - Program Output: `6` (Incorrect).
5. **Fifth Test Case**: `s = "01101001"`
   - Expected Output: `11` (Multiple shifts required).
   - Program Output: `8` (Incorrect).

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly compute the minimum cost for sorting the binary strings using the specified operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**

### Additional Notes
To correctly solve this problem, one would need to implement a strategy that calculates the minimum cost of cyclic shifts required to sort the string, possibly involving dynamic programming or a more sophisticated approach to handle the cost calculations accurately.
