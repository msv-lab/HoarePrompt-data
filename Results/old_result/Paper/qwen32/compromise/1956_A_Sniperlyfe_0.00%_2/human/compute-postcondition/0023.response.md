To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the precondition and the code step by step.

### Initial State:
1. **k**: The first integer from the input.
2. **q**: The second integer from the input.
3. **n**: The last element in the new list `qs`.
4. **p**: A list of integers read from the input.
5. **qs**: A new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element.
6. **res**: A list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Analysis:
- The `res` list contains the result of the function `func_1(n, p)`.
- The `map(str, res)` function converts each element in the `res` list to a string.
- The `' '.join(...)` function joins these string elements with a space in between to form a single string.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output a single string formed by joining the elements of the `res` list, which are the results of `func_1(n, p)`, with spaces in between.

Since the exact contents of `res` depend on the function `func_1(n, p)` and the values of `n` and `p`, we cannot determine the exact numerical values without the function's definition and the input values. However, we can describe the output format precisely.

### Final Output:
Output: **a string where each element of the `res` list (which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`) is converted to a string and joined with spaces** (where `res` is the list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`).
