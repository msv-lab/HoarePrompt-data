Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a non-negative integer representing the initial number of players, and `p` is a list of k integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= k <= 100 with 1 <= p[i] <= 100 for all i in the range of k; `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    k, q = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = []
    for n in qs:
        res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the last element in `qs`, `p` is a list of integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, `k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list containing as many elements as there are in `qs`, with each element being the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` is the first integer from the input, `q` is the second integer from the input, `n` is the last element in the new `qs`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `qs` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is the first integer from the input, `q` is the second integer from the input, `n` is the last element in the new `qs`, `p` is a new list of integers read from the input, `qs` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each element in `qs`, `t` is at least 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
