The only variable in the loop head is `n`, which is being iterated over the list `qs`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `n` to the next element in the list `qs`.

Given that `n` is the last element in the new `qs` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `qs` must have at least one more element. The new `n` will be the next element in the list `qs`.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- `n` should be the next element in `qs` after the current `n`.
- `qs` must have at least one more element for the loop to execute again.

State: **`k` is the first integer from the input, `q` is the second integer from the input, `n` is the next element in `qs` after the current `n`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `qs` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`**
