To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the code snippet on the variables. The code snippet provided appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we will assume it returns some value based on the inputs `n` and `p`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer representing the initial number of players.
- `p` is a list of integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round.
- `k` is the first input integer.
- `q` is the second input integer.
- `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least one element.
- `res` is an empty list.

The code snippet modifies `res` by appending the result of `func_1(n, p)` to it. Therefore, `res` will now contain one element, which is the output of `func_1(n, p)`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the initial number of players, `p` is a list of integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, `k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least one element, `res` is a list containing one element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.**
