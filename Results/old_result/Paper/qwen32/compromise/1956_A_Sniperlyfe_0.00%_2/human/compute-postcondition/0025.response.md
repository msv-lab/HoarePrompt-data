The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. 

Output State: **`k` is the first integer from the input, `q` is the second integer from the input, `n` is the next element in `qs` after the current `n`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `qs` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the newly appended result of `func_1(n, p)`**.

In simpler terms, after the code runs, `res` now contains one additional element, which is the result of calling `func_1(n, p)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
