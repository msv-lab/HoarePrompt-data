The code snippet appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Given the initial state, `n` is the last element in the list `qs`, and `p` is a new list of integers read from the input. The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, so we can only assume it returns some value based on the inputs `n` and `p`.

Since `res` was initially an empty list, after the execution of the code, `res` will contain one element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

Output State: **`k` is the first integer from the input, `q` is the second integer from the input, `n` is the last element in the new `qs`, `p` is a new list of integers read from the input, `qs` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `t` is at least 1**.
