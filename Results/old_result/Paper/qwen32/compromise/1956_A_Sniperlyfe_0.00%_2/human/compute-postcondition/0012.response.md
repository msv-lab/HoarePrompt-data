The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `qs`. If `qs` has more elements, the loop will execute again, taking the next element from `qs` and assigning it to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the next element in `qs`, meaning `qs` must have had at least one element left to assign to `n`. For the loop to execute again, `qs` must have more elements. The next element in `qs` will be assigned to `n` in the next iteration.

State: **`n` is the next element in `qs`, `p` is a list of integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, `k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least two elements, `res` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the result of `func_1(n, p)`**
