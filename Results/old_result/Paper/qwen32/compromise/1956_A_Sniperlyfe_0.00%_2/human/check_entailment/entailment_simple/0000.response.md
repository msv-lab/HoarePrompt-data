### Reasoning:

The problem involves simulating a game where players are removed from a line based on specific positions given by the sequence `a`. The task is to determine how many players remain after all possible rounds of removals for different initial numbers of players.

Let's break down the solution:

1. **Function `func_1(n, p)`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function simulates the game for a single initial number of players `n` and a list of positions `p`.
   - **Logic**: While the current number of players `n` is greater than or equal to the smallest position in `p`, it calculates how many players are removed in each round (those at positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`). It then reduces `n` by the count of such players.
   - **Output**: The function returns the number of players remaining after no more players can be removed.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a sequence `p` and a list of initial player counts `qs`. For each initial player count, it uses `func_1` to determine the number of winners and prints the results.
   - **Logic**: It reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `k` (length of `p`), `q` (number of initial player counts), the sequence `p`, and the list `qs`. It then processes each `n` in `qs` using `func_1` and prints the results.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Correctness of `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly simulates the game by repeatedly reducing the number of players based on the positions in `p`.
  - The condition `n >= min(p)` ensures that the loop continues as long as there are players to potentially remove.
  - The expression `sum(1 for x in p if x <= n)` correctly counts the number of players to be removed in each round.

- **Correctness of `func_2`**:
  - The function correctly reads and processes multiple test cases.
  - It reads the necessary inputs and calls `func_1` for each initial player count.
  - The results are collected in `res` and printed correctly.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly simulates the game and calculates the number of winners for each initial number of players in the test cases. The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
