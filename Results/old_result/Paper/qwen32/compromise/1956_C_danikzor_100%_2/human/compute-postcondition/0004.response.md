The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition, but based on the provided constraints and relationships, it processes multiple test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n` which represents the size of an `n x n` matrix. The function likely performs some operation on these matrices and returns a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the size of an `n x n` matrix. It performs an operation on these matrices and returns a result for each test case.**
