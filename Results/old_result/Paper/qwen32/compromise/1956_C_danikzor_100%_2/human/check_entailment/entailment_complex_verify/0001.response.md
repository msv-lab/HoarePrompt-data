### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the program:

1. **Maximum Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum sum using the formula \( \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6} \).
   - The correct formula for the maximum sum, given that each number from 1 to \( n \) appears exactly \( n \) times in the matrix, is \( \frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - The discrepancy indicates that the program's calculation of the maximum sum is incorrect.

2. **Operations**:
   - The program performs \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.
   - However, the operations described (filling each row and column with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 2, 1] \)) do not maximize the sum of the matrix. Specifically, the operations do not ensure that each number from 1 to \( n \) appears exactly \( n \) times in the matrix.

3. **Matrix Filling Strategy**:
   - To maximize the sum, each number from 1 to \( n \) should appear exactly \( n \) times in the matrix.
   - One way to achieve this is to fill the matrix such that each row and each column contains a permutation of the numbers from 1 to \( n \). This can be done by filling the matrix in a way that ensures each number is used optimally.

Given these points, the program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum and does not perform operations that achieve this maximum sum. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in concluding that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
