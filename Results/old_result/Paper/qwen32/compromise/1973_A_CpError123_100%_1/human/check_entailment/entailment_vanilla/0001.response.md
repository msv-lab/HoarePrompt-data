Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players in chess games. The scores are provided in non-decreasing order, and we need to check if the scores are consistent with any valid set of games.

### Key Observations:
1. **Total Points Must Be Even**: Since each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed (either 2-0 or 1-1), the sum of all players' scores must be even.
2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: To maximize the number of draws, we need to consider that each draw contributes 2 points. Therefore, the maximum number of draws is limited by the total points divided by 2. However, we also need to ensure that the scores can be achieved through a combination of wins and draws.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the program logic:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the scores of the three players.
2. **Even Total Points Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is even. If not, it prints `-1` because the scores cannot be consistent with any valid set of games.
3. **Calculate Maximum Draws**: The program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`, which represents the total number of games (since each game contributes 2 points). It then calculates `y` as `a + b`, which represents the points that the first and second players have together.
4. **Output**: The program prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. This is because the maximum number of draws is limited by the total number of games and the points that the first and second players have together.

### Correctness Check:
The logic of the program seems correct based on the observations:
- The check for even total points is necessary.
- The calculation of `x` and `y` and the subsequent `min` function correctly determine the maximum number of draws.

However, the program does not fully account for all possible inconsistencies in the scores. For example, it does not check if the scores can be achieved through a valid combination of wins and draws, which is more complex than just checking the total points and the combined points of the first two players.

### Counterexample:
Consider the case `1 1 10`. The program would output `2` because `(1 + 1 + 10) // 2 = 6` and `1 + 1 = 2`, so `min(6, 2) = 2`. However, this is incorrect because it is impossible to achieve scores of `1`, `1`, and `10` through a valid set of games. The correct output should be `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program is not fully correct because it does not account for all possible inconsistencies in the scores. Therefore, the Correctness is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
