### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning using the annotations and the problem description:

1. **Input Constraints and Output Requirements**:
   - The scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` must satisfy `0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30`.
   - The sum of scores `p1 + p2 + p3` must be even since each game contributes an even number of points.
   - The goal is to find the maximum number of draws, which is equivalent to minimizing the number of games that end in a win.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
   - It checks if the sum of the scores is even. If not, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to have a valid set of games with an odd total score.
   - If the sum is even, it calculates `x = (p1 + p2 + p3) // 2`, which represents the total number of games played.
   - It calculates `y = p1 + p2`, which represents the maximum number of draws possible if all games involving the two players with the lower scores were draws.
   - It prints the minimum of `x` and `y`, which correctly gives the maximum number of draws possible.

3. **Verification with Annotated Code**:
   - **State**: Before the function call, the program reads the number of test cases and the scores for each test case.
   - **State**: For each test case, the program checks if the sum of scores is even. If not, it prints `-1`.
   - **State**: If the sum is even, it calculates `x` and `y` and prints the minimum of the two.

4. **Edge Cases and Example Verification**:
   - **No games played**: `0 0 0`
     - Sum is even (`0`), `x = 0`, `y = 0`, output: `0` (correct).
   - **Single draw**: `0 1 1`
     - Sum is even (`2`), `x = 1`, `y = 1`, output: `1` (correct).
   - **Invalid scores**: `1 1 1`
     - Sum is odd (`3`), output: `-1` (correct).
   - **Multiple draws**: `3 4 5`
     - Sum is even (`12`), `x = 6`, `y = 4`, output: `4` (correct).
   - **Another valid case**: `1 1 10`
     - Sum is even (`12`), `x = 6`, `y = 2`, output: `2` (correct).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly handles all the given examples and edge cases.
   - The logic of checking for even sum and calculating the minimum of `x` and `y` is sound and aligns with the problem's requirements.
