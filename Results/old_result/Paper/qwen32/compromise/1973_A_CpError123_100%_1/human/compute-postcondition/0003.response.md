Functionality: **The function accepts three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30). It returns the result of a comparison between the scores to determine the ranking or outcome of the game among the three players.**
