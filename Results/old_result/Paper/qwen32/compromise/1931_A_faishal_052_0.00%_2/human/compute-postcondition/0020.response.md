Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing two elements, the first element is either 1 or 26 depending on the value of `lex`, and the second element is 26, `lex` is an integer between 1 and 26 if less than 52, otherwise greater than 51, `j` is 1**

Explanation: The list `arr` initially contains a single element, which is 1 if `lex` is less than or equal to 25, or 26 if `lex` is greater than 25. After the code `arr.append(26)` is executed, `arr` now contains two elements: the original element and the newly appended element, which is 26. All other variables remain unchanged.
