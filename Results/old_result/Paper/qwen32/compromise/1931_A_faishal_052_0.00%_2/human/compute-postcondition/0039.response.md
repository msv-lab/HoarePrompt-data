Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Analysis

1. **Variable `t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
2. **Variable `cases`**: Greater than or equal to 1.
3. **Variable `i`**: Initialized to 0.
4. **Variable `n`**: An integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 78\).
5. **Variable `arr`**: A sorted list based on the initial value of `lex`.
   - If `lex` is between 1 and 25, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`.
   - If `lex` is between 26 and 51, `arr` is `[lex - 26, 26, 26]`.
   - If `lex` is greater than 51, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex]`.
6. **Variable `lex`**: Modified based on its initial value.
   - If `lex` was initially between 1 and 51, it is modified to be between 0 and 25 if between 1 and 25, and between -25 and 25 if between 26 and 51.
   - If `lex` was initially greater than 51, it remains greater than 51.
7. **Variable `j`**: Initialized to 1.
8. **Variable `k`**: Initialized to 0.

### Print Statement Analysis

The print statement is:
```python
print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
```

- `arr[k]`: Since `k` is initialized to 0, `arr[k]` is `arr[0]`.
- `chr(arr[k] + 96)`: This converts `arr[0] + 96` to its corresponding ASCII character.

### Determining the Value of `arr[0]`

Given the definition of `arr`:
- If `lex` was initially between 1 and 25, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`, so `arr[0]` is 1.
- If `lex` was initially between 26 and 51, `arr` is `[lex - 26, 26, 26]`, so `arr[0]` is `lex - 26`.
- If `lex` was initially greater than 51, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex]`, so `arr[0]` is 26.

### Converting `arr[0] + 96` to ASCII

- If `arr[0]` is 1, `chr(1 + 96)` is `chr(97)`, which is 'a'.
- If `arr[0]` is `lex - 26` (where `lex` is between 26 and 51), `chr((lex - 26) + 96)` is `chr(lex + 70)`. Since `lex` is between 26 and 51, `lex + 70` is between 96 and 121, which corresponds to ASCII characters 'a' to 'y'.
- If `arr[0]` is 26, `chr(26 + 96)` is `chr(122)`, which is 'z'.

### Conclusion

The exact character printed depends on the initial value of `lex`:
- If `lex` was initially between 1 and 25, the output is 'a'.
- If `lex` was initially between 26 and 51, the output is a character between 'a' and 'y'.
- If `lex` was initially greater than 51, the output is 'z'.

Since the exact initial value of `lex` is not provided, we can only describe the possible outputs based on the given conditions.

Output: **a (if lex was initially between 1 and 25), a character between 'a' and 'y' (if lex was initially between 26 and 51), z (if lex was initially greater than 51)**
