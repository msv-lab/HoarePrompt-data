The loop provided is a `for` loop that iterates over a range of 3, meaning it will execute exactly 3 times. The loop body prints the characters corresponding to the ASCII values derived from the elements in the list `arr` at indices 0, 1, and 2, after adding 96 to each element.

Given the provided output states for the first three iterations, we can observe that:
- The variable `k` ranges from 0 to 2.
- The other variables (`t`, `cases`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, `lex`, `j`) remain unchanged throughout the iterations.

Since the loop runs exactly 3 times and the value of `k` is controlled by the `range(3)` function, after the loop finishes, `k` will be 3 (as the loop variable is incremented to the next value after the last iteration).

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, cases is greater than or equal to 1, i is 1, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, arr is a list sorted in ascending order based on the initial value of lex, lex is reduced by 2, 27, or 52 based on the initial value of lex, j is 2, k is 3**

In natural language, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the values of the variables remain the same as described in the initial state, except for `k`, which will be 3.
