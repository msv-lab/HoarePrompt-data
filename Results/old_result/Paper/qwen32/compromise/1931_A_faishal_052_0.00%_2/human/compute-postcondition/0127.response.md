Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `cases` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.
- `arr` is one of the following lists based on the value of `lex`:
  - [1, 1, lex]
  - [lex, 1, 1]
  - [1, lex, 26]
  - [lex, 1, 26]
  - [1, 26, lex]
  - [lex, 26, 26]
  - [26, 26, lex]
- `lex` is adjusted to be in the range -25 to 51.
- `j` is 2.
- `k` is 0.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. `k` is 0, so `arr[k]` refers to the first element of the list `arr`.
2. The first element of `arr` can be one of the following based on the possible configurations of `arr`:
   - 1 (from [1, 1, lex], [1, lex, 26], [1, 26, lex])
   - `lex` (from [lex, 1, 1], [lex, 1, 26], [lex, 26, 26], [26, 26, lex])
3. The `chr()` function converts an ASCII value to a character. The ASCII value is calculated as `arr[k] + 96`.
4. If `arr[k]` is 1, then `chr(1 + 96)` is `chr(97)`, which corresponds to the character `'a'`.
5. If `arr[k]` is `lex`, then `chr(lex + 96)` will be the character corresponding to the ASCII value `lex + 96`.

### Output Determination:
- If `arr[k]` is 1, the output will be `'a'`.
- If `arr[k]` is `lex`, the output will be the character corresponding to `lex + 96`.

Since `lex` is adjusted to be in the range -25 to 51:
- The smallest possible value for `lex + 96` is `-25 + 96 = 71`, which corresponds to the character `'G'`.
- The largest possible value for `lex + 96` is `51 + 96 = 147`, but since `lex` is adjusted to be within -25 to 51, and `chr()` for values greater than 126 will not correspond to a standard ASCII character, we consider the valid range for `lex` to be within 0 to 26 to get valid lowercase letters.

Thus, the most precise description of the output is:
- If `arr[k]` is 1, the output is `'a'`.
- If `arr[k]` is `lex` and `lex` is in the range 0 to 26, the output is the character corresponding to `lex + 96`.

Given the constraints and the possible configurations of `arr`, the most common and valid scenario for `arr[k]` being 1 results in the output `'a'`.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **a**
