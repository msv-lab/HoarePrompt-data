The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 2 (inclusive), meaning it will execute when `k` is 0, 1, and 2. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` would need to be 0, which is the start of a new loop iteration sequence.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is either [1, 1, lex], [lex, 1, 1], [1, lex, 26], [lex, 1, 26], [1, 26, lex], [lex, 26, 26], or [26, 26, lex] depending on the value of `lex`, `lex` is adjusted to be in the range -25 to 51, `j` is 2, and `k` is 0**
