The value of `lex` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is either [1, 1] if `lex` was less than or equal to 25, or [26, 1] if `lex` was greater than 26, `lex` is adjusted to be in the range 0 < `lex` - 1 < 26 if it was originally less than 52, or `lex - 27` if it was 52 or greater, `j` is 1, `k` is 3.
