The code snippet `lex = int(input())` takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `lex`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is the integer input by the user, `j` is 2, `k` is 3.**
