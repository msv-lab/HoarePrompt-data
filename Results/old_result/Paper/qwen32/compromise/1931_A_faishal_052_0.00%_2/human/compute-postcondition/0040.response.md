The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than 3. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 0, which means the loop has just started. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is sorted based on the initial value of `lex` (either `[1, 1, lex]` if lex is between 1 and 25, `[lex - 26, 26, 26]` if lex is between 26 and 51, or `[26, 26, lex]` if lex is greater than 51), `lex` is modified to be between 0 and 25 if it was initially between 1 and 51, between -25 and 25 if it was initially between 27 and 51, or greater than 51 if it was initially greater than 51, `j` is 1, `k` is 1**
