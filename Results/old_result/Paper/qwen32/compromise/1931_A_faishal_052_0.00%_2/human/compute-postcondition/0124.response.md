The code snippet `arr.append(lex)` adds the value of `lex` to the end of the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `arr` can be one of three values: `[1, 1]`, `[26, 1]`, or `[26, 26]`. After appending `lex`, `arr` will be `[1, 1, lex]`, `[26, 1, lex]`, or `[26, 26, lex]` respectively. The value of `lex` is adjusted to be in the range -25 to 51, but its exact value is not specified, so we will keep it as `lex`.

Other variables (`t`, `cases`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is either [1, 1, lex], [26, 1, lex], or [26, 26, lex], `lex` is adjusted to be in the range -25 to 51, `j` is 2, and `k` is 3.**
