The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2.

However, since the loop will terminate when `j` is 2, the state at the start of the next iteration where the loop can still execute would be when `j` is 1, because the next increment will make it 2, and the loop will terminate after that.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing two elements where the first element is 1 if `lex` (initially) is less than or equal to 25, or 26 if `lex` (initially) is greater than 25, and the second element is 1 if `lex` was initially between 1 and 26, or 26 otherwise, `lex` is modified to be between 0 and 25 if it was initially between 1 and 26, between -25 and 25 if it was initially between 27 and 51, or greater than 25 if it was initially greater than 51, `j` is 1**
