The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. Since the initial value of `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, after subtracting 26, the new value of `lex` will be between 1 and 26. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26, `lex` is an integer between 1 and 26.**
