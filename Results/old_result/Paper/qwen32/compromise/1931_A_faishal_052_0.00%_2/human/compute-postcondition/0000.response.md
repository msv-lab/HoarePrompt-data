The code snippet assigns the integer value of the input to the variable `cases`. The variable `t` and the condition for `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this input operation. Therefore, `cases` will hold the integer value provided by the user input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is an input integer, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.**
