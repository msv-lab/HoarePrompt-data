Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26, `lex` is an integer greater than 0, `j` is 0, `k` is 3. If `lex` is greater than 0 but less than 26, `lex` is greater than 0 but less than 26; otherwise, `lex` is greater than 25.**
