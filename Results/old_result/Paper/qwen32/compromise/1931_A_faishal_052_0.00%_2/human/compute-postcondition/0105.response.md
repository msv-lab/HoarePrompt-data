The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 2. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is either [1] if `lex` was less than or equal to 25, or [26] if `lex` was greater than 26, `lex` is adjusted to be in the range 0 < `lex` < 26 if it was originally less than 52, or `lex - 26` if it was 52 or greater, `j` is 1, `k` is 3**
