The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop runs as long as `j` is less than 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2, but since the loop condition is `j < 2`, the loop will not execute again after `j` is incremented to 2.

However, to reflect the state right before the loop terminates, we should increment `j` to 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is either [1, 1] if `lex` was less than or equal to 25, [26, 1] if `lex` was between 26 and 51, or [1, 26] or [26, 26] if `lex` was 52 or greater, `lex` is adjusted to be in the range 0 < `lex` - 1 < 26 if it was originally less than 52, or `lex - 27` if it was 52 or greater, `j` is 2, and `k` is 3**
