Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State Analysis:

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
   - `cases` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.
   - `arr` is a sorted list based on the initial value of `lex`:
     - If `lex` is between 1 and 25, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`.
     - If `lex` is between 26 and 51, `arr` is `[lex - 26, 26, 26]`.
     - If `lex` is greater than 51, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex]`.
   - `lex` is modified to be:
     - Between 0 and 25 if it was initially between 1 and 51.
     - Between -25 and 25 if it was initially between 27 and 51.
     - Greater than 51 if it was initially greater than 51.
   - `j` is initialized to 1.
   - `k` is initialized to 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
   ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Value of `k`:**
   - `k` is initialized to 1.
   - Therefore, `arr[k]` refers to the second element of the list `arr`.

2. **Value of `arr[k]` (i.e., `arr[1]`):**
   - If `lex` is between 1 and 25:
     - `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`.
     - Hence, `arr[1]` is 1.
   - If `lex` is between 26 and 51:
     - `arr` is `[lex - 26, 26, 26]`.
     - Hence, `arr[1]` is 26.
   - If `lex` is greater than 51:
     - `arr` is `[26, 26, lex]`.
     - Hence, `arr[1]` is 26.

3. **Value of `chr(arr[k] + 96)`:**
   - If `arr[1]` is 1:
     - `chr(1 + 96)` is `chr(97)`, which is `'a'`.
   - If `arr[1]` is 26:
     - `chr(26 + 96)` is `chr(122)`, which is `'z'`.

### Conclusion:

- If `lex` is between 1 and 25, `arr[1]` is 1, and `chr(arr[k] + 96)` is `'a'`.
- If `lex` is between 26 and 51 or greater than 51, `arr[1]` is 26, and `chr(arr[k] + 96)` is `'z'`.

Since the exact value of `lex` is not provided, the output depends on the value of `lex`. However, we can describe the possible outputs based on the given conditions.

### Final Output:

Output: **`'a'` if `lex` is between 1 and 25, otherwise `'z'`**
