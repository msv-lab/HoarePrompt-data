The code appends the integer `1` to the list `arr`. Therefore, `arr` will now contain one element, which is `1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is [1], `lex` is the integer input by the user and `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `j` is 0, `k` is 3.**
