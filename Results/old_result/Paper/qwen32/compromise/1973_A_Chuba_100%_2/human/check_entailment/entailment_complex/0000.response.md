### Reasoning:

The program's logic is based on the observation that the total points awarded in each game is either 2 (for a win-lose scenario) or 2 (for a draw scenario). Therefore, the sum of all scores across the three players must be even for the scores to be valid.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players, where `p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3`.

2. **Even Sum Check**: It checks if the sum of the scores `p1 + p2 + p3` is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to have an odd total score from the described game rules.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws**: If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws. The formula used is:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{(p1 + p2 + p3 - \max(0, p3 - p1 - p2))}{2}
   \]
   This formula attempts to maximize the number of draws while ensuring the scores are consistent with the rules. The term `max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)` ensures that we do not subtract more points than are available, which could lead to invalid negative scores.

### Verification with Examples:

- **Example 1**: Input `0 0 0`
  - Sum is `0` (even), so it calculates `result = (0 + 0 + 0 - max(0, 0 - 0 - 0)) // 2 = 0`. Output is `0`.

- **Example 2**: Input `0 1 1`
  - Sum is `2` (even), so it calculates `result = (0 + 1 + 1 - max(0, 1 - 0 - 1)) // 2 = 1`. Output is `1`.

- **Example 3**: Input `1 1 1`
  - Sum is `3` (odd), so it outputs `-1`.

- **Example 4**: Input `1 1 2`
  - Sum is `4` (even), so it calculates `result = (1 + 1 + 2 - max(0, 2 - 1 - 1)) // 2 = 2`. Output is `2`.

- **Example 5**: Input `3 3 3`
  - Sum is `9` (odd), so it outputs `-1`.

- **Example 6**: Input `3 4 5`
  - Sum is `12` (even), so it calculates `result = (3 + 4 + 5 - max(0, 5 - 3 - 4)) // 2 = 6`. Output is `6`.

- **Example 7**: Input `1 1 10`
  - Sum is `12` (even), so it calculates `result = (1 + 1 + 10 - max(0, 10 - 1 - 1)) // 2 = 2`. Output is `2`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the maximum possible number of draws or determines that the scores are invalid based on the given rules. The logic and calculations are consistent with the problem statement.
