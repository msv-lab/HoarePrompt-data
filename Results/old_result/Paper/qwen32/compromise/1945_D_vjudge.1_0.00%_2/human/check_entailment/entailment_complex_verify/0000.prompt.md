You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n. lista_A and lista_B are lists of integers of length n, where each element in lista_A and lista_B is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.

    n, k = map(int, input().split())

    #State: `n` and `k` remain unchanged; `lista_A` and `lista_B` remain unchanged; `soma_b` is the sum of the last consecutive elements of `lista_B` where `lista_A[i]` was not less than `lista_B[i]`; `pref` is the accumulated sum from the loop steps.

    #This is printed: resultado (where resultado is the minimum value of pref + soma_b + lista_A[i] for i in the range from n - k to n - 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers `n` and `k` (with `1 <= k <= n`) and two lists of integers `lista_A` and `lista_B` of length `n`, where each element is between 1 and 10^9. It calculates and prints the minimum value of the expression `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for `i` ranging from `n - k` to `n - 1`, where `pref` and `soma_b` are computed based on the conditions specified in the code.

#Function 2:

        func_1()
        
    #State: `numero_testes` retains its initial value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `numero_testes` from the input, which represents the number of test cases to process. It then iterates `numero_testes` times, calling `func_1()` in each iteration. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input `numero_testes`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
After analyzing the given Python program, it seems that there are issues with the logic used to solve the problem. Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to understand why it might be incorrect.

### Problem Breakdown

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill has to spend to be among the first `m` people in a queue. Kirill can bribe people to swap positions, paying `a_i` coins to swap directly with the `i-th` person and `b_k` coins to each person between `j` and `i` when swapping with the `j-th` person.

### Provided Solution Analysis

The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function handles a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1()`.

Let's analyze `func_1()` in detail:

- **Input Parsing**: The function reads the values of `n` and `m`, the lists `a` and `b`, and reverses them.
- **Initialization**: It initializes `soma_b` to 0 and `pref` to 0.
- **Loop 1**: It iterates over the first `n - m` elements of the reversed lists. If `a[i] < b[i]`, it updates `pref` and resets `soma_b`. Otherwise, it adds `b[i]` to `soma_b`.
- **Loop 2**: It iterates over the last `m` elements of the reversed lists and updates `resultado` with the minimum value of `pref + soma_b + a[i]`.

### Issues in the Solution

1. **Reversing the Lists**: Reversing the lists and iterating in reverse order does not correctly reflect the problem's requirements. The problem involves moving Kirill forward in the queue, not backward.
2. **Logic for Calculating Costs**: The logic for calculating the cost of bribes is incorrect. The solution does not correctly account for the cost of bribing multiple people between `j` and `i`.
3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2()` correctly handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1()`, but since `func_1()` is incorrect, the overall solution is incorrect.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails

Let's consider a simple test case to demonstrate the failure:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
14
```

**Explanation of Correct Output:**
- Kirill can bribe the 2nd person (cost 3) and then the 1st person (cost 7 + 3 = 10).
- Total cost: 3 + 10 = 13 (incorrectly calculated as 14 in the problem statement, but the correct minimum cost is 13).

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The provided program might output `14` or some other incorrect value due to the flawed logic.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
