The code snippet pushes a tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` onto the `max_heap`. Given the initial state, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `m - 1` is `tp2`. The value of `i` is not specified but is part of the tuple being pushed. The `max_heap` is initially empty, and after the operation, it will contain one element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is at least 1, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing the tuple `(-abs(i - b[m - 1]), i, m - 1)`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`.**
