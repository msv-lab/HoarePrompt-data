The code calculates `diff2` as the absolute difference between `item[1]` (which is `a[i]` from the tuple `item`) and `b[tp2]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, and `max_heap` remain unchanged. The variable `diff1` is also unchanged as it was calculated before this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is `-n`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples of the form `(-diff, a[i], index_in_b)`, `item` is the tuple `(-diff, a[i], index_in_b)` that was popped from `max_heap`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, and `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`.**

In simple terms, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `diff2` has been calculated as the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`.
