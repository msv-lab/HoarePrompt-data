Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is an integer between 0 and `m`, `tp2` is an integer between 0 and `m`, and `ans` is the accumulated sum of the largest differences found during the loop for all test cases. If `__name__` is not equal to `'__main__'`, the program does nothing and retains the initial state of the variables.**
