The code snippet sets the variable `ans` to 0. This overwrites the previous value of `ans`, which was described as the sum of the minimum differences. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input and is now sorted.**
