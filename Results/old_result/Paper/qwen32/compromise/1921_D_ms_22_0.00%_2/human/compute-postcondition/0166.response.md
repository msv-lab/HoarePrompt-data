The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` and `tp2` are adjusted indices, `ans` is the sum of the minimum differences, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input.**
