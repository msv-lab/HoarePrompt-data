The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between `item[1]` (which is `a_i` from the initial state) and `b[tp2]` (which is `b[m - 1]` from the initial state). This value is assigned to `diff2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is 0; `item` is the tuple `(-abs(a_i - b[0]), a_i, 0)` or `(-abs(a_i - b[m - 1]), a_i, m - 1)` with the largest absolute difference; `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`; `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`.**
