The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between the variable `i` and the last element of the sorted list `b`, and assigns this value to `diff2`. 

Given that `diff1` is already calculated as `abs(i - b[0])`, the only change here is the introduction of `diff2` with the value `abs(i - b[m - 1])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is at least 1, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`**.
