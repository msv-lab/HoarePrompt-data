The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between the variable `i` and the first element of the sorted list `b`, and assigns this value to `diff1`. The values of `max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element, `b` is a list of integers read from the input and is now sorted, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`**.
