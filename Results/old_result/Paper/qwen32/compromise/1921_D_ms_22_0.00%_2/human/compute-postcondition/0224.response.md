The value of `ans` is incremented by the negative of the first element of the tuple `item`, which is `-(-diff)`, or simply `diff`. The other variables (`max_heap`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `item`) remain unchanged.
Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, i, index)` (one less than before), `t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `n` elements, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, index)` that was popped from `max_heap`; `ans` is incremented by `diff`.**
