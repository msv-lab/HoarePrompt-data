The code `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)` removes and returns the smallest element from the `max_heap`, which is a max-heap in Python (implemented as a min-heap with negative values). However, since the precondition states that `max_heap` must contain at least one tuple, we can assume that an item will be successfully popped.

Given that `max_heap` is a max-heap and contains at least one tuple, the popped `item` will be the tuple with the smallest first element. Since the exact contents of `max_heap` are not specified, we can denote the popped item as `item`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple after the pop operation, `item` is the tuple that was popped from `max_heap`.**
