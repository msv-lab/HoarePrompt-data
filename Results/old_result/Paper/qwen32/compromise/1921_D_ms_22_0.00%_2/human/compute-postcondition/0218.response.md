The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` and assigns it to `diff2`. 

Given the initial state, the values of `max_heap`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The variable `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, index)` that was popped from `max_heap`, and `diff1` is already calculated as the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`. The new variable `diff2` is introduced and calculated as the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`.

Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, i, index)` (one less than before), `t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `n` elements, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, index)` that was popped from `max_heap`; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`.**
