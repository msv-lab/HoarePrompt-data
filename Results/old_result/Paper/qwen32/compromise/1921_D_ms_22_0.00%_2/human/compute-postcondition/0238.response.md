The code snippet `ans += -item[0]` modifies the variable `ans` by adding the negation of the first element of the tuple `item` to it. Given that `item` is of the form `(-diff, i, index)`, the value `-item[0]` is equivalent to `diff`.

Therefore, the variable `ans` will be increased by `diff`. The other variables (`max_heap`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `item`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, i, index)` (one less than before), `t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, index)` that was the smallest in `max_heap` before the pop operation, `ans` is increased by `diff`.**
