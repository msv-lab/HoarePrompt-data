The code calculates the absolute difference between the second element of the popped tuple `item` and the element at index `tp1` in the sorted list `b`. This value is assigned to the variable `diff1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple after the pop operation, `item` is the tuple that was popped from `max_heap`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`.**
