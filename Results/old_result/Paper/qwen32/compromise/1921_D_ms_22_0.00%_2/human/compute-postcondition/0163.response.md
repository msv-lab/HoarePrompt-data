Given the initial state:

- `max_heap` is an empty list.
- `tp1` and `tp2` are adjusted indices.
- `ans` is the sum of the minimum differences.

The task is to determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement.

Since the exact values of `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` are not explicitly provided in the initial state, we can only describe `ans` based on the information given.

`ans` is described as the sum of the minimum differences. However, without knowing the specific elements or the process by which these differences are calculated, we cannot determine a numerical value for `ans`. Therefore, we describe `ans` in terms of its definition.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the minimum differences)**
