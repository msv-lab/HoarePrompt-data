Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `max_heap` is an empty list.
2. `tp1` and `tp2` are updated positions in `b`.
3. `ans` is the sum of the largest differences calculated.
4. `t` is 0.
5. `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
6. `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `ans` is described as the sum of the largest differences calculated. However, there is no information provided about what these differences are or how they are calculated.
- Given that `max_heap` is empty and `t` is 0, we can infer that no operations have been performed that would modify `ans` from its initial state.
- Since no initial value for `ans` is provided, we can assume that `ans` is initialized to 0 (a common default for sums).

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, the most precise description we can give is that `ans` is the sum of the largest differences calculated, which, given the initial state, is likely 0.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **0 (where ans is the sum of the largest differences calculated)**
