The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` and assigns it to `diff2`. No other variables are modified by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, `item`, `ans`, and `diff1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `-n`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` has one less element, `item` is the tuple `(-diff, a[i], index_in_b)` that was popped from `max_heap`, `ans` is updated based on the conditions, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`.**
