Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, i, index)` (one less than before), `t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `n` elements, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, index)` that was popped from `max_heap`; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`.**

In natural language: The `max_heap` now has one less tuple than before. The variable `t` has been decremented by 1. The variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged as integers read from the input. The list `a` with `n` elements and the sorted list `b` remain unchanged. The variable `item` holds the tuple that was popped from `max_heap`. A new variable `diff1` is introduced, which is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the element at index `tp1` in the list `b`.
