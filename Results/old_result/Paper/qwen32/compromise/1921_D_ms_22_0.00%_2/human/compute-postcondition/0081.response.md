To determine the final state of the loop after all iterations, let's analyze the loop's behavior. The loop continues until `max_heap` is empty. Each iteration involves popping an item from `max_heap` and updating `ans` and the pointers `tp1` and `tp2` based on the conditions specified.

### Key Points:
1. **`max_heap`**: It is a max-heap (implemented as a min-heap with negative values) containing tuples of the form `(-abs(a_i - b[j]), a_i, j)`.
2. **`tp1` and `tp2`**: These are pointers that track the current range in `b` that we are considering. `tp1` starts at 0, and `tp2` starts at `m-1`.
3. **`ans`**: This variable accumulates the sum of the largest differences found during the loop.

### Loop Execution:
- In each iteration, the tuple with the largest absolute difference (smallest negative value) is popped from `max_heap`.
- If the index `j` of the popped tuple is outside the current range `[tp1, tp2]`, the code calculates the differences `diff1` and `diff2` with the current `b[tp1]` and `b[tp2]`, updates `tp1` or `tp2` accordingly, and adds the larger difference to `ans`.
- If the index `j` is within the range `[tp1, tp2]`, the absolute value of the popped tuple's first element (which is the negative of the largest difference) is added to `ans`, and `tp1` or `tp2` is updated based on whether `j` equals `tp1` or `tp2`.

### Final State:
The loop continues until `max_heap` is empty. At this point:
- `max_heap` will be empty.
- `tp1` and `tp2` will have traversed the entire list `b` as needed.
- `ans` will contain the accumulated sum of the largest differences found during the loop.

### Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is an integer between 0 and `m`, `tp2` is an integer between 0 and `m`, and `ans` is the accumulated sum of the largest differences found during the loop.**

In simpler terms, the loop will finish when all elements have been processed from `max_heap`, and `ans` will hold the total sum of the largest differences calculated during the loop's execution. The pointers `tp1` and `tp2` will reflect the traversal of the list `b`.
