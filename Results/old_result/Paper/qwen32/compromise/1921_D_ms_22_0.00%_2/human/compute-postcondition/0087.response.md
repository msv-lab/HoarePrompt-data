The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and assigns them to the list `b`. This means `b` is now a list of integers read from the input, but it is not specified whether it is sorted or not in the code snippet. However, the initial state specifies that `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers. Therefore, after executing the code, `b` will be overwritten with the new list of integers from the input, and it may or may not be sorted depending on the input provided.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is an integer between 0 and `m`, `tp2` is an integer between 0 and `m`, and `ans` is the accumulated sum of the largest differences found during the loop.**
