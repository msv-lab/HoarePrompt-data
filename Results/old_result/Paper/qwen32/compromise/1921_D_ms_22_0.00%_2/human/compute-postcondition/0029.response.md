The code snippet `heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))` pushes a new tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` onto the `max_heap`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `diff1`, `diff2`, or `i` directly. It only modifies the `max_heap` by adding the new tuple to it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is at least 1, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `max_heap` contains the tuples `(-abs(i - b[0]), i, 0)` and `(-diff1, i, 0)`. `i` is the next element in the list `a`.**
