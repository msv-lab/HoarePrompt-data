After the loop executes all its iterations, the following state will be reached:

- `t` will be `-n` (since it starts at `0` and is decremented by `1` in each iteration for `n` times).
- `n` and `m` will remain unchanged as they are input values.
- `a` will remain unchanged as it is only read from, not modified.
- `b` will remain unchanged as it is only read from, not modified.
- `tp1` and `tp2` will remain unchanged as they are not modified inside the loop.
- `ans` will remain `0` as it is not modified inside the loop.
- `max_heap` will contain `n` tuples, each representing the largest absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the smallest or largest element in `b`, along with the corresponding indices.

In Natural Language: After all the iterations, `t` will have been decremented `n` times, resulting in `-n`. The lists `a` and `b`, and the variables `n`, `m`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` will retain their initial values. The `max_heap` will contain `n` tuples, each indicating the largest absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the smallest or largest element in `b`, along with the index of the element in `b` used for the comparison.

Output State: **`t` is `-n`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, and `max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form `(-diff, a[i], index_in_b)`.**
