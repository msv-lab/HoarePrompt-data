Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, i, index)` (one less than before), `t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, index)` that was the smallest in `max_heap` before the pop operation, `ans` is increased by `diff`, `tp1` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms: The `max_heap` now has one less tuple than before, `t` has been decremented by 1, `n` and `m` remain the same integers read from the input, `a` remains the same list of integers with `n` elements, `b` remains the same sorted list of integers, `item` holds the tuple that was the smallest in `max_heap` before it was popped, `ans` has been increased by `diff`, and `tp1` has been incremented by 1.
