Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples, each tuple is of the form `(-diff, i, index)` where `diff` is the maximum of `abs(i - b[0])` and `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, `i` is an element from list `a`, and `index` is either `0` or `m - 1` depending on which difference was maximum. The variables `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states, with `tp1` being 0, `tp2` being `m - 1`, `ans` being 0, `t` being a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` and `m` being integers read from the input, `a` being a list of integers read from the input with `n` elements, and `b` being a sorted list of integers read from the input.**

In simpler terms: After the loop has executed for all elements in list `a`, `max_heap` will contain `n` tuples. Each tuple represents the maximum difference between an element `i` from list `a` and either the first or last element of the sorted list `b`, along with the index of the element in `b` that was used to calculate this difference. The other variables like `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` will stay the same as they were initially.
