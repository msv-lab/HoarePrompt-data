The only object in the loop head is the variable `val_b`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `main_ar` list. If `main_ar` has at least one more tuple, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `main_ar` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple. This means that there is at least one tuple left in `main_ar` for the next iteration. The variables `sec_arr` and `sub_summ` are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

Since `val_b` is the current tuple being processed, at the start of the next iteration, `val_b` will be the next tuple in `main_ar`.

State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`, `val_b` is the next tuple in `main_ar`**
