The only objects in the loop head are the variable `val_a` and the list `sec_arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `sec_arr`. If `sec_arr` has at least 3 tuples, the loop will execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `sec_arr` has at least 2 tuples, and `val_a` is the second tuple in `sec_arr`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `sec_arr` must have at least 3 tuples, and `val_a` should be the third tuple in `sec_arr`.

State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `sub_summ` is `val_a[0] + val_a[0]`, `val_a` is the third tuple in `sec_arr`**
