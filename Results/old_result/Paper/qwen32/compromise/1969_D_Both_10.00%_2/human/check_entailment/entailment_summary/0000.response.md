### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: The function is intended to read an integer from the input, but it references `putin()`, which is not defined in the given code snippet. Given the context, `putin` is likely supposed to be `sys.stdin.readline`. If we assume this correction, the function is correctly implemented to read and return an integer.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads a line of input, splits it into components, and converts each component to an integer, returning a map object. This is correctly implemented for reading input parameters and item prices.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function calculates the sum of the first elements of tuples in `sec_arr` and adds the sum of the two integers in each tuple of `main_ar` if that sum is non-negative. This is correctly implemented for calculating the sub-sum based on the logic described.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of items) and `k` (number of items Bob can take for free).
   - It reads the prices for Alice (`a`) and Bob (`b`), converting Alice's prices to negative for a max-heap simulation.
   - It pairs each item's prices into tuples and sorts these tuples by Bob's price in ascending order.
   - It uses a max-heap (`k_arr`) to keep track of the `k` most expensive items Alice has bought (by storing their negative prices).
   - It calculates the initial sub-sum for items not in the heap.
   - It iteratively updates the sub-sum as it considers removing items from the heap and adding new ones, ensuring to maximize Alice's profit.
   - It prints the maximum profit for each test case.

### Issues Identified:
- The main program logic has a logical error. The initial heap push and pop logic is not correctly implemented for the problem's requirements.
- The loop and sub-sum calculation do not correctly simulate the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob.
- The `func_1` function is not correctly defined in the provided code but can be assumed to be correct with the `putin` correction.

### Correctness:
Given the logical errors in the main program's implementation of the strategy for Alice and Bob, the program as a whole does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
