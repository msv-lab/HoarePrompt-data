Let's analyze the provided Python code in the context of the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves Alice and Bob playing a game where Alice selects a subset of items to buy, and Bob can either take all the items for free if Alice buys less than `k` items, or take `k` items for free and pay for the rest. Alice's goal is to maximize her profit, while Bob's goal is to minimize Alice's profit.

To maximize her profit, Alice should choose items such that the difference between Bob's payment and her expenditure is maximized. This requires a strategic selection of items based on their prices for Alice and Bob.

### Code Analysis

The provided code includes three functions, but it lacks the main logic to solve the problem. Let's break down the functions:

1. **func_1()**: This function reads an integer from the input.
2. **func_2()**: This function reads a line of integers from the input and returns them as a map object.
3. **func_3(main_ar, sec_arr)**: This function calculates a sum based on the provided arrays `main_ar` and `sec_arr`. However, the logic inside this function does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Issues with the Provided Code

1. **Input Handling**: The code does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement.
2. **Logic for Profit Calculation**: The function `func_3` does not correctly implement the logic to calculate Alice's profit. It simply sums up some values without considering the strategic selection of items based on Alice's and Bob's prices.
3. **Heap Usage**: The problem description suggests using a heap (priority queue) to efficiently manage and select items, but the provided code does not utilize this.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, the following steps should be taken:

1. **Read Input**: Properly read the number of test cases and for each test case, read `n`, `k`, `a_i`, and `b_i`.
2. **Calculate Profit**: For each item, calculate the potential profit if Alice buys it (`b_i - a_i`). Use a heap to efficiently manage the items and select the `k` items that Bob will take for free.
3. **Maximize Profit**: Alice should buy items that maximize her profit. If Alice buys less than `k` items, Bob can take all for free, so Alice should aim to buy at least `k` items if possible.
4. **Output Result**: For each test case, output Alice's maximum possible profit.

### Conclusion

Given the provided code does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**

The code lacks the necessary logic to handle the problem requirements and does not correctly compute Alice's profit.
