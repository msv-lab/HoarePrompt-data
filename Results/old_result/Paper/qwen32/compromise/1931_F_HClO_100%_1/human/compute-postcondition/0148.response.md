The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables outside of the loop context. Given that there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement here would have no effect on the variables or their values.

Therefore, none of the variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`) are altered by the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`_` is `n + m - 2`, `t` is such that `n + m - 2` is less than `t`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input line, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any elements that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding any elements that are equal to `a1`.**
