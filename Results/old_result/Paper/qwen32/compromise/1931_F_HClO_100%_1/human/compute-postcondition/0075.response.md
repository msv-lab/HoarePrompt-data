The given Python code snippet simply initializes an empty list named `val`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`) are modified by this code.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same except for the addition of the new variable `val`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the next input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `idx1` is -1; `idx2` is -1; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0; the loop has completed all `n - 1` iterations without setting `idx1` and `idx2` to non-negative values; `val` is an empty list.**
