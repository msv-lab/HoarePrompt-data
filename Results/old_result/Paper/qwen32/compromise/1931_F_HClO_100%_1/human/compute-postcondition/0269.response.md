To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for _ in range(m - 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From this, we can see that the only variable being adjusted in each iteration is `_`. The variable `_` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, starting from 0 up to `m - 3`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a1` is the first integer from the input.
- `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input.
- `a2` is 12.
- `l2` is [13, 14, 15].
- `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any 12s.
- `l22` is [13, 14, 15] excluding `a1` if `a1` is in [13, 14, 15].
- `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (8, [9, 10, 11])]`.
- `_` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration and `x + 1 < t`.
- `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`.
- `n` and `m` are the values read from the input.
- `idx1` is not `-1`.
- `idx1 <= idx2`.
- `m` must be at least 3.

Since the loop iterates over the range `m - 2`, the loop will execute `m - 2` times. At the start of the next iteration, `_` will be incremented by 1.

Let's denote the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration as `x`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `_` will be `x + 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is 12, `l2` is [13, 14, 15], `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any 12s, `l22` is [13, 14, 15] excluding `a1` if `a1` is in [13, 14, 15], `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (8, [9, 10, 11])]`, `_` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration and `x + 2 < t`, `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`, `n` and `m` are the values read from the input, `idx1` is not `-1`, `idx1 <= idx2`, `m` must be at least 3**
