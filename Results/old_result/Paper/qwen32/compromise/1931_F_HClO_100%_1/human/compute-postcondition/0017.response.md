The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. Since `_` does not represent any specific state that needs to be adjusted, the only relevant state to consider is the loop control variable `m`.

The loop will execute `m - 2` times. At the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have completed one of its iterations, meaning it has executed `k` times where `k` is some integer such that `0 < k < m - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k + 1` should be less than `m - 1`, which implies `k < m - 2`.

Since the loop variable `_` does not affect the state directly, the state variables that need adjustment are related to the loop's continuation condition. Specifically, `m` should remain unchanged, as it dictates how many times the loop should run.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same with respect to the loop's control logic.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `m` must be at least 3, `a1` is the first integer from the next input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, and `l11` is not equal to `l22`**
