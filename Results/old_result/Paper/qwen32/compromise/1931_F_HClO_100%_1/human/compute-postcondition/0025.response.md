In the given task, the for loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop variable here is `i`, and the range is determined by `n - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, the range `(n - 1)` must be greater than or equal to 1. This implies that `n` must be at least 2.

Let's analyze the provided state and identify which parts need adjustment to ensure the loop can execute:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.
- If `m` is 1, it remains 1.
- `a1` is the first integer from the next input line.
- `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same input line.
- `a2` is the first integer from the new input line.
- `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line.
- `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`.
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.
- If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be at least 3.
- `idx1` is -1.
- `idx2` is -1.
- `p1` is 0.
- `p2` is 0.

From this, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `n`. To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least 2.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be at least 2, `m` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the next input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be at least 3, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0**
