Postcondition: **`_` is `n - 1` if `l11` equals `l22`, otherwise `_` is `n + m - 2`. `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`. `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1. `m` is the second integer from the input. `a1` is the first integer from the new input line. `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line. `a2` is the first integer from the latest input line. `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input line. `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any elements that are equal to `a2`. `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding any elements that are equal to `a1`. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 1, and `p2` is 0. Otherwise, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, and `p2` is 1. If `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]` except when `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` in the if part or `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` in the else part. Additionally, `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`.**
