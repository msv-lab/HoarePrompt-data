The given Python code snippet only contains an `input()` function call without assigning its result to any variable. This means that the input is taken but not stored or used further in the provided code. As a result, none of the existing variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `m`) are affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`_` is `n - 1`, `t` is such that `n` is less than `t`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input.**
