The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and assigns the first integer to `a1` while the rest are collected into `l1`. This means `a1` will hold the first integer from the input, and `l1` will be a list containing the remaining integers.

Given the initial state, `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the code. Since `a1` is being reassigned here, `a2` remains as it was initially. The variables `l11` and `l22` also remain unchanged. The variable `val` is a predefined list of tuples and is not affected by this code snippet. The conditions related to `t`, `n`, `m`, `x`, `idx1`, and `idx2` are also not impacted by this particular line of code.

Output State: **`a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` remains unchanged, `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged, `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (8, [9, 10, 11])]`, `_` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration and `x + 1 < t`; `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` and `m` are the values read from the input; `idx1` is not `-1`; `idx1 <= idx2`.**
