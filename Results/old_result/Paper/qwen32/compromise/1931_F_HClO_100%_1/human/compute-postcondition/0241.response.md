The code snippet appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Given the initial conditions, `val` initially contains three tuples: `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (4, [5, 6, 7]), (a3, l3)]`. After appending `(a3, l3)`, `val` will now contain four tuples.

Here is the updated state:

- `_` remains `_ + 2`.
- `t` remains such that `_ + 2` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`.
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged except `m` must be greater than 2.
- `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged.
- `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged.
- `idx1` is not `-1`.
- If `idx1 < idx2`, then `l2` has `a2` inserted at position `idx1` and `idx1` is less than `idx2 + 1`.
- If `idx1 > idx2`, then `idx2` is `n - 2` and `l1` has `a1` inserted at index `n - 2`.
- If `idx1 <= idx2`, then `m` is 1, `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (4, [5, 6, 7]), (a3, l3), (a3, l3)]`.

Output State: **`_` is `_ + 2`, `t` is such that `_ + 2` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` and `m` remain unchanged except `m` must be greater than 2; `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged; `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged; `idx1` is not `-1`; If `idx1 < idx2`, then `l2` has `a2` inserted at position `idx1` and `idx1` is less than `idx2 + 1`; If `idx1 > idx2`, then `idx2` is `n - 2` and `l1` has `a1` inserted at index `n - 2`; If `idx1 <= idx2`, then `m` is 1, `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (4, [5, 6, 7]), (a3, l3), (a3, l3)]`.**
