The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into an integer `a3` and a list of integers `l3`. This affects the variables `a3` and `l3` but does not change the other variables listed in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `m` is at least 3, `n` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the next input line, `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` if `idx1 >= idx2`, otherwise `l1` remains unchanged, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` if `idx1 < idx2`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2` (before the insertion of `a1`), `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `idx1` is either -1 or `n - 2`, `idx2` is not -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, the loop has completed all `n - 1` iterations without setting `idx1` to a non-negative value (except possibly in the last iteration), `val` is an empty list if `idx1 < idx2`, otherwise `val` contains an additional element `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from the new input line and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, if `idx1 > idx2`, `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` and `m` is decremented by 1. If `idx1 < idx2`, `l` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `a3` is the first integer from the new input line, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line.**
