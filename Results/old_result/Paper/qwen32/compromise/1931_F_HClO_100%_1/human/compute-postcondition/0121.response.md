The only objects in the loop head are `a3` and `l3`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `val` list. If `val` has more elements, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `val` contained `m - 1` elements if `idx1 < idx2`, or `m` elements if `idx1 > idx2`. Each element of `val` is a tuple `(a3, l3)`. After the last iteration, one element has been processed, so `val` now contains `m - 2` elements if `idx1 < idx2`, or `m - 1` elements if `idx1 > idx2`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `val` must still have at least one element. Therefore, `val` should contain `m - 2` elements if `idx1 < idx2`, or `m - 1` elements if `idx1 > idx2`.

Since the loop processes one element at a time, the next element in `val` will be assigned to `(a3, l3)`. The specific values of `a3` and `l3` depend on the current state of `val`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is at least 3, `n` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the next input line, `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` if `idx1 >= idx2`, otherwise `l1` remains unchanged, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` if `idx1 < idx2`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2` (before the insertion of `a1`), `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `idx1` is either -1 or `n - 2`, `idx2` is not -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, the loop has completed all `n - 1` iterations without setting `idx1` to a non-negative value (except possibly in the last iteration), `val` contains `m - 2` elements if `idx1 < idx2`, or `m - 1` elements if `idx1 > idx2`, each element being a tuple `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from the new input line and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with `a3` removed, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

The next element in `val` will be assigned to `(a3, l3)`, so we need to specify the next element in `val`:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is at least 3, `n` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the next input line, `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` if `idx1 >= idx2`, otherwise `l1` remains unchanged, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` if `idx1 < idx2`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2` (before the insertion of `a1`), `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `idx1` is either -1 or `n - 2`, `idx2` is not -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, the loop has completed all `n - 1` iterations without setting `idx1` to a non-negative value (except possibly in the last iteration), `val` contains `m - 2` elements if `idx1 < idx2`, or `m - 1` elements if `idx1 > idx2`, each element being a tuple `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from the new input line and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with `a3` removed, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `a3` is the next integer from the input, `l3` is the list of remaining integers from the input with `a3` removed.**
