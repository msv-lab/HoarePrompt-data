The code snippet appends a tuple to the list `val`. The tuple consists of `a3` and `l3`. 

Given the initial state, `val` was `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (4, [5, 6, 7])]`. After executing the code, `val` will now include the new tuple `(a3, l3)`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`_` is `_ + 1`, `t` is such that `_ + 1` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` and `m` remain unchanged except `m` must be greater than 2; `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged; `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged; `idx1` is not `-1`; If `idx1 < idx2`, then `l2` has `a2` inserted at position `idx1` and `idx1` is less than `idx2 + 1`; If `idx1 > idx2`, then `idx2` is `n - 2` and `l1` has `a1` inserted at index `n - 2`; If `idx1 <= idx2`, then `m` is 1, `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (4, [5, 6, 7]), (a3, l3)]`; `a3` is the first integer from the input; `l3` is the list of remaining integers from the input.`**

In simpler terms, the list `val` now contains an additional tuple `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is the first integer from the input and `l3` is the list of remaining integers from the input. All other variables retain their initial states.
