The code snippet reads a new line of input, splits it into integers, assigns the first integer to `a2`, and the rest to `l2`. This means `a2` will hold the first integer from the new input line, and `l2` will be a list of the remaining integers from that same line.

Given the initial state, the only variables that will be affected are `a2` and `l2`. The other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is `n - 1`, `t` is such that `n` is less than `t`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input line.**
