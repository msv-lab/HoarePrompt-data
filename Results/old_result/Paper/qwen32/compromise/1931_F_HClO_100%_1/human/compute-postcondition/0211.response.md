The code snippet `l = l2` assigns the value of `l2` to `l`. This means that `l` now holds the same list as `l2`, which includes `a2` inserted at position `idx1`.

Output State: **`_` is `n - 1` if `l11` equals `l22`, otherwise `_` is `n + m - 2`; `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` and `m` remain unchanged; `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged; `l1` remains unchanged; `l2` has `a2` inserted at position `idx1`; `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged; `l` is `l2`; if `idx2` was initially `-1` and `idx1` is not `-1`, then `idx2` is `n - 2`; `idx1` is not `-1` if `idx2` was initially `-1`; `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged; `val` is an empty list; `idx1` is less than `idx2 + 1`**
