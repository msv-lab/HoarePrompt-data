The given code snippet appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Given the initial state, `a3` is 4 and `l3` is `[5, 6, 7]`. Therefore, the tuple `(4, [5, 6, 7])` will be added to `val`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`_` is `n - 1` if `l11` equals `l22`, otherwise `_` is `n + m - 2`; `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` and `m` remain unchanged except `m` must be greater than 2; `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged; `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged; `idx1` is not `-1`; If `idx1 < idx2`, then `l2` has `a2` inserted at position `idx1` and `idx1` is less than `idx2 + 1`; If `idx1 > idx2`, then `idx2` is `n - 2` and `l1` has `a1` inserted at index `n - 2`; If `idx1 <= idx2`, then `m` is 1, `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (4, [5, 6, 7])]`, `a3` is 4, `l3` is `[5, 6, 7]`. If the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, `l1` is modified by inserting `a1` at position `idx2` and `l2` remains unchanged, resulting in `l` being `l1` with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`. Otherwise, `l1` remains unchanged, `l2` has `a2` inserted at position `idx1`, and `l` is `l2` with `a2` inserted at position `idx1`. `m` must be greater than 2; `a3` is 4; `l3` is `[5, 6, 7]`.**

In simpler terms, the list `val` now contains two tuples: `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (4, [5, 6, 7])]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
