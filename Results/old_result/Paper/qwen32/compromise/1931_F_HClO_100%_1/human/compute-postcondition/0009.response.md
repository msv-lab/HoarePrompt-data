The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and assigns the first integer to `a2` and the rest to `l2`. 

Given the initial state, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, and `l1` remain unchanged except for the new variables `a2` and `l2` being introduced.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; If `m` is 1, then the current value of `m` remains 1; `a1` is the first integer from the next input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line.**
