The code snippet creates a new list `l22` that contains elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. This means that any occurrence of `a1` in `l2` will be removed in `l22`.

Given the initial state, `l22` is derived from `l2` by filtering out all instances of `a1`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l11`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; If `m` is 1, then the current value of `m` remains 1; `a1` is the first integer from the next input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.**
