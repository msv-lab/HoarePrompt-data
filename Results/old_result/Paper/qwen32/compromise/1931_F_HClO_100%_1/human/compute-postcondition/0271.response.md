To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for _ in range(m - 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variable `_` is the loop control variable, and it ranges from `0` to `m - 3` (since the range function in Python is exclusive of the stop value).

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a1` is the first integer from the input.
- `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input.
- `a2` is 12.
- `l2` is [13, 14, 15].
- `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any 12s.
- `l22` is [13, 14, 15] excluding `a1` if `a1` is in [13, 14, 15].
- `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (8, [9, 10, 11])]`.
- `_` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration and `x + 2 < t`.
- `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`.
- `n` and `m` are the values read from the input.
- `idx1` is not `-1`.
- `idx1 <= idx2`.
- `m` must be at least 3.

Since the only variable in the loop head is `_`, we need to adjust its value for the next iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` was `x + 1`. For the next iteration, `_` should be incremented by 1 again, so it becomes `x + 2`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is 12, `l2` is [13, 14, 15], `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any 12s, `l22` is [13, 14, 15] excluding `a1` if `a1` is in [13, 14, 15], `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (8, [9, 10, 11])]`, `_` is `x + 2` where `x` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration and `x + 3 < t`, `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`, `n` and `m` are the values read from the input, `idx1` is not `-1`, `idx1 <= idx2`, `m` must be at least 3**
