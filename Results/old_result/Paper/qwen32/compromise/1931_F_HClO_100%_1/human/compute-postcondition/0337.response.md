The code snippet `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value of `a2` at the position `idx1` in the list `l2`.

Given the initial state, `a2` is 12, and `idx1` is `n - 2` if `idx1 == -1 and idx2 != -1`, otherwise `idx1` remains -1. Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `idx1`, we consider two cases:

1. If `idx1` is `-1`, it remains `-1` and no insertion happens in `l2`.
2. If `idx1` is `n - 2` and `idx1 != -1`, `a2` (which is 12) is inserted at position `n - 2` in `l2`.

However, since the problem does not specify `idx1` being `-1` or `n - 2`, we assume the general case where `idx1` is a valid index.

Thus, `l2` will have `a2` (12) inserted at the position `idx1`.

Output State: **`a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is 12, `l2` is [13, 12, 14, 15] if `idx1` is 0, [13, 14, 12, 15] if `idx1` is 1, [13, 14, 15, 12] if `idx1` is 2, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any 12s, `l22` is [13, 14, 15] excluding `a1` if `a1` is in [13, 14, 15], `val` is [], `_` is `x + (m - 2)` where `x` is the initial value of `_` and `x + (m - 2) < t` if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `_` remains unchanged, `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`, `n` is the value read from the input, `m` is the value read from the input, `i` is `n - 1`, `p1` and `p2` are determined by the comparisons made during the iterations, `idx1` is `n - 2` if `idx1 == -1 and idx2 != -1`, otherwise `idx1` remains -1, and `idx2` is `n - 2` if `idx2 == -1 and idx1 != -1`. Additionally, `idx1` is less than `idx2`.** 

In simpler terms, `l2` now includes `12` at the position `idx1`, and all other variables remain unchanged.
