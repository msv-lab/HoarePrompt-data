The code snippet `l = l1` assigns the value of `l1` to the variable `l`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Given the initial state, `l1` is a list that includes the first integer from the input (`a1`) inserted at position `idx2`, along with the remaining integers from the input. Since `l` is now assigned the value of `l1`, `l` will also be this same list.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`, `a2` is 12, `l2` is [13, 14, 15], `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any 12s (before the insertion), `l22` is [13, 14, 15] excluding `a1` if `a1` is in [13, 14, 15], `val` is [], `_` is `x + (m - 2)` where `x` is the initial value of `_` and `x + (m - 2) < t` if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `_` remains unchanged, `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`, `n` is the value read from the input, `m` is the value read from the input, `i` is `n - 1`, `p1` and `p2` are determined by the comparisons made during the iterations, `idx1` is `n - 2` if `idx1 == -1 and idx2 != -1`, otherwise `idx1` remains -1, and `idx2` is `n - 2` if `idx2 == -1 and idx1 != -1`. Additionally, `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`. The current state satisfies `idx1 > idx2`. `l` is a list of the remaining integers from the input with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`.**
