Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `_` is determined by the condition: `n - 1` if `l11` equals `l22`, otherwise `n + m - 2`.
- `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`.
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
- `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged.
- `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged.
- `idx1` is not `-1`.
- `idx1 <= idx2`.
- `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7])]`.
- The loop terminates as there are no more tuples to iterate over.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('no')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('no')` statement directly prints the string `'no'`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply outputs the string `'no'`.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the print statement will output the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
