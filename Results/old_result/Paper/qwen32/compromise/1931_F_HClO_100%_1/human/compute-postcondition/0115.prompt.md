Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the next input line; `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` if `idx1 >= idx2`, otherwise `l1` remains unchanged; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` if `idx1 < idx2`; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2` (before the insertion of `a1`); `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `idx1` is either -1 or `n - 2`; `idx2` is not -1; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0; the loop has completed all `n - 1` iterations without setting `idx1` to a non-negative value (except possibly in the last iteration); `val` is an empty list if `idx1 < idx2`, otherwise `val` contains an additional element `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from the new input line and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; if `idx1 > idx2`, `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` and `m` is decremented by 1. If `idx1 < idx2`, `l` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is at least 3, `n` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the next input line, `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` if `idx1 >= idx2`, otherwise `l1` remains unchanged, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` if `idx1 < idx2`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2` (before the insertion of `a1`), `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `idx1` is either -1 or `n - 2`, `idx2` is not -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, the loop has completed all `n - 1` iterations without setting `idx1` to a non-negative value (except possibly in the last iteration), `val` contains an additional element `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from the new input line and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, if `idx1 > idx2`, `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` and `m` is decremented by 1. If `idx1 < idx2`, `l` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `a3` is the first integer from the new input line, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line.`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is at least 2, `n` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the next input line, `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` if `idx1 >= idx2`, otherwise `l1` remains unchanged, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` if `idx1 < idx2`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2` (before the insertion of `a1`), `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `idx1` is either -1 or `n - 2`, `idx2` is not -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, the loop has completed all `n - 1` iterations without setting `idx1` to a non-negative value (except possibly in the last iteration), `val` contains an additional element `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from the new input line and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, if `idx1 > idx2`, `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`. If `idx1 < idx2`, `l` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `a3` is the first integer from the new input line, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `val` now includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is at least 2, `n` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the next input line, `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` if `idx1 >= idx2`, otherwise `l1` remains unchanged, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` if `idx1 < idx2`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2` (before the insertion of `a1`), `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `idx1` is either -1 or `n - 2`, `idx2` is not -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, the loop has completed all `n - 1` iterations without setting `idx1` to a non-negative value (except possibly in the last iteration), `val` contains an additional element `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from the new input line and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, if `idx1 > idx2`, `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`. If `idx1 < idx2`, `l` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `a3` is the first integer from the new input line, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `val` now includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
