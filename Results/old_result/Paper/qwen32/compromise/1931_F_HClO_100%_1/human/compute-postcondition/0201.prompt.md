Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is `n - 1` if `l11` equals `l22`, otherwise `_` is `n + m - 2`; `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the latest input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input line; `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any elements that are equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding any elements that are equal to `a1`; `idx1` is -1; `idx2` is -1; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is `n - 1` if `l11` equals `l22`, otherwise `_` is `n + m - 2`. `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`. `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1. `m` is the second integer from the input. `a1` is the first integer from the new input line. `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line. `a2` is the first integer from the latest input line. `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input line. `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any elements that are equal to `a2`. `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding any elements that are equal to `a1`. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and the most internal loop or if statement breaks. Otherwise, if `idx1` is non-negative and `idx2` is non-negative, the most internal loop or if statement breaks. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged as per the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is `n - 1` if `l11` equals `l22`, otherwise `_` is `n + m - 2`; `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the latest input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input line; `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any elements that are equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding any elements that are equal to `a1`; `i` is incremented by 1. If `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are set to `i` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is `n - 1` if `l11` equals `l22`, otherwise `_` is `n + m - 2`; `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the latest input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input line; `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any elements that are equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding any elements that are equal to `a1`; `i` is incremented by 1. If `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to `i` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is also broken out of. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, the control continues without modifying `idx1` and `idx2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
