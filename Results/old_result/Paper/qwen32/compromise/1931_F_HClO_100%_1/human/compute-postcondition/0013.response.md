To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head:

```python
for _ in range(m - 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if and only if the expression `m - 2` is greater than or equal to 1. This means that `m` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.
- If `m` is 1, then the current value of `m` remains 1.
- `a1` is the first integer from the next input line.
- `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same input line.
- `a2` is the first integer from the new input line.
- `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line.
- `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`.
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.
- Additionally, `l11` is not equal to `l22`.

The only variable in the loop head that we can adjust is `m`. To ensure the loop executes, `m` must be at least 3.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `m` must be at least 3, `a1` is the first integer from the next input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, and `l11` is not equal to `l22`.**
