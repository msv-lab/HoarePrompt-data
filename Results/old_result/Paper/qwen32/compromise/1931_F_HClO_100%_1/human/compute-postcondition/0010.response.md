The code snippet creates a new list `l11` by filtering out all occurrences of `a2` from the existing list `l1`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.
- If `m` is 1, then the current value of `m` remains 1.
- `a1` is the first integer from the next input line.
- `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same input line.
- `a2` is the first integer from the new input line.
- `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line.

After executing the code snippet:
- `l11` is a new list that contains all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; If `m` is 1, then the current value of `m` remains 1; `a1` is the first integer from the next input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`.**
