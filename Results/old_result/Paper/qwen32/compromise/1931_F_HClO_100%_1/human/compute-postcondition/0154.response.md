Output State: **`_` is `n - 1` if `l11` equals `l22`, otherwise `_` is `n + m - 2`; `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the latest input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input line; `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any elements that are equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding any elements that are equal to `a1`; `idx1` is -1; `idx2` is -1; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0; `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of the variables remain unchanged except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The variable `_` retains its value based on the condition involving `l11` and `l22`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `i`) also retain their original values.
