Given the initial state, the program will return the values of `n` and `k` as they are. Here is the output state:

Output State: **The program returns `n`, which is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and `k`, which is a non-negative even integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) and less than or equal to `max_k`. If `n` is odd, `max_k` is set to `(n - 1) / 2`. If `n` is even, `max_k` is set to `n`.**
