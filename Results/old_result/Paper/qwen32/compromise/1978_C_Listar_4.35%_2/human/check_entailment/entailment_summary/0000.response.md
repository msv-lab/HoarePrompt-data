### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: To validate the inputs `n` and `k` and determine if a valid permutation exists.
   - **Logic**:
     - If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` because the Manhattan value can only be even.
     - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) for a permutation of length `n`.
     - If `k` is greater than `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)` because `k` is too large to be achieved.
     - Otherwise, it returns the original values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: To generate a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k`.
   - **Logic**:
     - It starts with the identity permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
     - It modifies the permutation based on the value of `k` by moving elements in a specific pattern.
     - The exact pattern is not fully clear from the provided description, but it seems to be designed to create the desired Manhattan value.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - **Purpose**: To print the permutation if a valid one is found.
   - **Logic**:
     - It prints "YES" followed by the permutation elements.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - **Purpose**: To tie everything together by calling `func_2` to validate inputs, `func_1` to generate the permutation, and `func_3` to print the result.
   - **Logic**:
     - It calls `func_2` to get `n` and `k`.
     - If `n` is `0`, it prints "NO" because the inputs are invalid.
     - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to get the permutation and then `func_3` to print it.

### Issues:
- The function `func_2` seems to have an incorrect calculation of `max_k`. For a permutation of length `n`, the maximum Manhattan value is `n*(n-1)/2` (which is the sum of the first `n-1` natural numbers), not `n**2 // 2` or `(n**2 - 1) // 2`.
- The function `func_1` is supposed to generate a permutation with a specific Manhattan value, but the provided logic does not seem to guarantee this. The pattern of rearranging elements based on `k` is not fully explained, and it's unclear if it always produces the correct permutation.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with `func_2` and the unclear logic in `func_1`, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
