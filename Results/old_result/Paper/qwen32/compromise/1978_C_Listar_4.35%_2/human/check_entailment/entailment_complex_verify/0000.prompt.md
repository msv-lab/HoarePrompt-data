You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

    #State: the list `l` is modified based on the value of `k` and the loop conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k` as inputs. It returns a list of integers from 1 to `n` that has been modified based on the value of `k`. The modifications involve rearranging the elements of the list according to specific conditions derived from the value of `k`. If `k` is 0, the function returns the list in its original order. Otherwise, elements are moved within the list following a specific pattern until `k` is reduced to 0 or all possible rearrangements are performed.

    #State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and `k` is a non-negative even integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12). If `n` is odd, `max_k` is set to `(n - 1) / 2`. If `n` is even, `max_k` is set to `n`.
    if (max_k < k) :

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input. It returns `(0, 0)` if `k` is odd or if `k` is greater than a calculated maximum value `max_k`. Otherwise, it returns the original values of `n` and `k`. The maximum value `max_k` is `(n - 1) // 2` if `n` is odd, and `n // 2` if `n` is even.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a list `l` of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, where each integer is distinct and ranges from 1 to `n`. It prints the integers in the list in the order they appear, separated by spaces, followed by an empty line. The function does not return any value (returns `None`).

    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_3(l)
    return
    #The program returns nothing (None)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` takes no direct input parameters but implicitly receives values `n` and `k` from `func_2`. It checks if `n` is zero, in which case it prints 'NO' and terminates without returning any value. If `n` is not zero, it calls `func_1` with `n` and `k`, then passes the result to `func_3`. The function does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as specified in the problem description. Let's analyze why:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) based on whether `n` is odd or even.
   - For odd `n`, `max_k` is calculated as `(n ** 2 - 1) // 2`.
   - For even `n`, `max_k` is calculated as `n ** 2 // 2`.
   - However, the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is actually `n * (n - 1) // 2`. This is because the maximum deviation for each element is `n - 1`, and there are `n` elements, but the sum of deviations is halved due to the absolute value symmetry.
   - The current calculation for `max_k` is incorrect and can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function attempts to construct a permutation with a given Manhattan value `k`.
   - The logic for constructing the permutation is not correct and does not guarantee that the resulting permutation will have the exact Manhattan value `k`.
   - The loop and the way elements are moved in the list do not ensure that the correct number of inversions (which contribute to the Manhattan value) are introduced.

3. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function orchestrates the input reading, calls `func_2` to check if the permutation is possible, and then calls `func_1` to construct the permutation.
   - Since `func_2` and `func_1` have issues, `func_4` will not produce correct results for all cases.

To illustrate, consider the test case `n = 3` and `k = 4`:
- The correct output should be `Yes` followed by a permutation like `3 1 2` with a Manhattan value of 4.
- However, the current implementation will not correctly handle this case due to the incorrect calculation of `max_k` and the flawed logic in `func_1`.

Thus, the program is incorrect for at least one potential case, and the correct response is `False`.
