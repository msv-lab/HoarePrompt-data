To determine the output state, we need to understand the function `func_1`. Since `func_1` is not defined in the provided code snippet, we can't directly calculate the new value of `result`. However, based on the given information, we can assume that `func_1` takes two arguments and returns a value that is assigned to `result`.

Given:
- `numbers` is a list of integers with at least two elements, where each integer is a multiplier (2 ≤ numbers[i] ≤ 20).
- `result` is initially set to the first element of `numbers`.

The code snippet modifies `result` by calling `func_1(result, num)`. Since `num` is not defined in the given code snippet, we can assume that `num` is likely to be another element from the `numbers` list, possibly the second element, given the context.

Let's assume `num` is the second element of the `numbers` list for the sake of this explanation. The new value of `result` will be whatever `func_1` returns when called with the initial `result` and `num`.

Since we don't have the definition of `func_1`, let's denote the returned value as `func_1(result, num) = some_value`. Therefore, the new value of `result` will be `some_value`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least two elements, where each integer is a multiplier (2 ≤ numbers[i] ≤ 20); `result` is the value returned by `func_1(result, num)`**.
