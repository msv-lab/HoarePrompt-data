### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine a betting strategy such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. The strategy involves finding a common multiple of the multipliers \( k_i \) and then distributing the bets accordingly.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \( n \) and the multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n \).

2. **Finding the Least Common Multiple (LCM)**: The function `func_2` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers using the helper function `func_1`, which computes the LCM of two numbers by using the formula:
   \[
   \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
   \]
   The LCM of the list of numbers is found iteratively by applying this formula to the current result and the next number in the list.

3. **Distributing Bets**: Once the LCM \( m \) is found, the program calculates the bet for each outcome as \( \frac{m}{k_i} \). This ensures that if the i-th outcome wins, the total bet \( \sum x_i \) is strictly less than \( k_i \times x_i = m \).

4. **Validation**: The program checks if the total sum of the bets \( \sum x_i \) is less than the LCM \( m \). If not, it outputs `-1` indicating no valid distribution exists. Otherwise, it outputs the calculated bets.

### Analysis:

The strategy of using the LCM ensures that the condition \( \sum x_i < k_i \times x_i \) is met for all \( i \). Here's why:

- For each outcome \( i \), the bet \( x_i = \frac{m}{k_i} \).
- The total bet is \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{m}{k_i} \).
- Since \( m \) is the LCM of all \( k_i \), \( \frac{m}{k_i} \) is an integer for all \( i \).
- The total bet \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{m}{k_i} \) is strictly less than \( m \) because \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k_i} < 1 \) (since \( k_i \geq 2 \) and there are at least two different \( k_i \) values in most cases, ensuring the sum is less than 1).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy to find a valid betting distribution if it exists. Thus, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and the logic used.
