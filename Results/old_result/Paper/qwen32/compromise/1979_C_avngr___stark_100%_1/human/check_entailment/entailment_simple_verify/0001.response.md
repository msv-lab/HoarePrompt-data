### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotations to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Understanding:
The task is to distribute a certain number of coins across `n` possible outcomes such that, for each outcome, the amount received (which is the bet multiplied by the outcome's multiplier) is strictly greater than the total amount bet. Specifically, if you bet `x_i` on the `i-th` outcome, and the multiplier for that outcome is `k_i`, then the total bet `sum(x_j)` must be less than `k_i * x_i` for every `i`.

#### Approach:
The solution strategy should find a set of bets `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` such that the total bet is less than the amount received for each winning outcome. One straightforward strategy is to assign bets such that each `x_i` is large enough to satisfy the condition `sum(x_j) < k_i * x_i` for all `j`.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code includes two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula `abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`.
2. `func_2(numbers)`: This function calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1`.

The main part of the code:
- Reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case:
  - Reads the number of outcomes `n`.
  - Reads the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.
  - Calculates the LCM `m` of the multipliers.
  - Assigns bets `c_i` such that `c_i = m // k_i` for each `i`.
  - Checks if the total bet `sum(c_i)` is less than `m`. If not, it prints `-1`.
  - Otherwise, it prints the bets `c_i`.

#### Annotations:
- `func_1(a, b)`: This correctly calculates the LCM of two numbers.
- `func_2(numbers)`: This correctly calculates the LCM of a list of numbers.
- The main part of the code calculates the LCM `m` of the multipliers and assigns bets `c_i = m // k_i`.
- It checks if the total bet `sum(c_i)` is less than `m`. If the total bet is not less than `m`, it prints `-1`.

#### Evaluation:
The key point is to verify if the bets `c_i = m // k_i` satisfy the condition `sum(x_j) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

- For each `i`, the bet `c_i = m // k_i`.
- The total bet is `sum(c_i) = sum(m // k_i)`.
- We need to check if `sum(m // k_i) < k_i * (m // k_i)` for all `i`.

By the properties of LCM, `m` is a multiple of each `k_i`, so `m // k_i` is an integer. The condition `sum(m // k_i) < k_i * (m // k_i)` simplifies to checking if the total bet is less than `m`.

The program checks if `sum(c_i) < m`. If this condition is satisfied, it prints the bets `c_i`. If not, it prints `-1`.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does correctly solve the problem. It calculates the LCM of the multipliers, assigns bets based on the LCM, and checks if the total bet is less than the amount received for each winning outcome. If the condition is satisfied, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
