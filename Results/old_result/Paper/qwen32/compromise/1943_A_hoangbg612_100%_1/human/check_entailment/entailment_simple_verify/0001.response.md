### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally on the array `a`. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it. The optimal strategies involve Alice trying to include as many consecutive integers as possible in `c`, and Bob trying to disrupt this sequence by removing elements that Alice might need.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to determine the MEX by:
1. Sorting the input array `N`.
2. Iterating through the sorted array to find the smallest missing integer.
3. Adjusting the current MEX (`cur`) based on the frequency of elements.

Let's evaluate the annotated code step-by-step to understand its behavior:

1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `N` is sorted. Sorting is not necessary for finding the MEX directly, but it can simplify the process of identifying the smallest missing integer.

2. **Finding the Smallest Missing Integer:**
   - The program initializes `cur` to -1 and uses a dictionary `M` to track the frequency of each element in `N`.
   - It iterates through the sorted array `N`:
     - If `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` and breaks the loop.
     - Otherwise, it updates `cur` to `num` and records its frequency in `M`.
     - If `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the frequency of `cur` in `M`.

3. **Adjusting the MEX:**
   - After the loop, if the sum of frequencies in `M` equals `S` (the size of `N`), it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then creates a list `cnt` of keys from `M` where the frequency is 1.
   - If the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, it sets `cur` to `cnt[1]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `cur`, which is intended to be the MEX.

#### Issues with the Program:
- **Incorrect MEX Calculation:** The program does not correctly account for the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. It simply finds the smallest missing integer without considering the alternating turns and strategic removals.
- **Handling Edge Cases:** The program does not handle cases where the array contains all elements from 0 to n-1, or when there are multiple elements with the same value, in a manner that reflects optimal play.
- **Logic Flaws:** The logic for determining the MEX is flawed. The program does not simulate the game turns and does not correctly determine the MEX after optimal play.

#### Example Analysis:
Let's examine the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `4, [0, 0, 1, 1]`
  - Sorted: `[0, 0, 1, 1]`
  - `cur` becomes 1 after the loop.
  - `sum(M.values())` equals 4, so `cur` becomes 2.
  - `cnt` is `[0, 1]`, so `cur` becomes 1.
  - Output: `1` (Incorrect, should be `2`)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `4, [0, 1, 2, 3]`
  - Sorted: `[0, 1, 2, 3]`
  - `cur` becomes 3 after the loop.
  - `sum(M.values())` equals 4, so `cur` becomes 4.
  - `cnt` is `[]`, so `cur` remains 4.
  - Output: `4` (Incorrect, should be `1`)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `2, [1, 1]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 1]`
  - `cur` becomes 1 after the loop.
  - `sum(M.values())` equals 2, so `cur` becomes 2.
  - `cnt` is `[]`, so `cur` remains 2.
  - Output: `2` (Incorrect, should be `0`)

#### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly determine the MEX under optimal play by Alice and Bob.

### Final: **False**
