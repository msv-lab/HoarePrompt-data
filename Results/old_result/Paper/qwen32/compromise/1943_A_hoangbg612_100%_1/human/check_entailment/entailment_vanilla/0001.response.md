Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to find the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally on the array `a`. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it.

### Key Points:
1. **MEX Definition:** The smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
2. **Optimal Play:**
   - Alice will try to add elements to `c` that will maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to add elements to `a` that will minimize the MEX.

### Strategy:
- To maximize the MEX, Alice should try to include as many consecutive integers as possible in `c`.
- Bob, on the other hand, will try to disrupt this sequence by removing elements that Alice might need.

### Program Analysis:
The program attempts to determine the MEX by:
1. Sorting the input array `N`.
2. Iterating through the sorted array to find the smallest missing integer.
3. Adjusting the current MEX (`cur`) based on the frequency of elements.

However, there are several issues with the logic in the program:
1. **Sorting:** Sorting the array is not necessary for finding the MEX.
2. **Tracking Frequencies:** The program tries to track frequencies of elements, but this is not optimal for finding the MEX.
3. **Logic for Determining MEX:** The logic for determining the MEX is incorrect. The program does not correctly account for the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.
4. **Handling Edge Cases:** The program does not handle cases where the array contains all elements from 0 to n-1, or when there are multiple elements with the same value.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the logic and the incorrect handling of the problem, the program does not correctly determine the MEX under optimal play by Alice and Bob.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
