Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly determine the game's final score when both players play optimally. Let's analyze the code and find a counterexample.

The code attempts to find the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends. However, it does not correctly simulate the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Specifically, the code does not account for the fact that Alice wants to maximize the MEX and Bob wants to minimize it.

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
4
0 0 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Alice can start by picking 2, making `c = [2]` and `a = [0, 0, 1]`.
- Bob picks 0, making `a = [0, 1]`.
- Alice picks 1, making `c = [2, 1]` and `a = [0]`.
- Bob picks 0, making `a = []`.
- The final array `c` is `[2, 1]`, and the MEX is 3.

**Actual Output of the Code:**
The code will likely output `2` or another incorrect value because it does not simulate the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.

The code incorrectly assumes that sorting the array and then calculating the MEX will give the correct result, which is not the case when both players are playing optimally.

Therefore, the code is incorrect for this and potentially other cases.
