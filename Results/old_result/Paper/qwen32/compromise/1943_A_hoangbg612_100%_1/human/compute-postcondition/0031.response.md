The code snippet `M[cur] = 1` sets the value of `M[cur]` to 1. This affects the dictionary `M` by updating the entry for the key `cur` to 1. The values of other variables (`T`, `S`, `N`, `num`, and `cur`) remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by subsequent code, which is not provided here.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the next element in `N` after the current `num`, `cur` is updated to the value of `num`, and `M[cur]` is 1.**
