The code snippet provided increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. The values of `T`, `S`, `N`, and `num` remain unchanged. Since `M[cur]` is updated directly, its new value is the previous value plus one.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the next element in `N` after the current `num`, and `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**
