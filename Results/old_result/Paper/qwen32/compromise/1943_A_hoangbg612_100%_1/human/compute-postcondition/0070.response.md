Postcondition: **`cur` is either `num` or -1, `M` is either `{num: 1}` or `{-1: 1}`, `S` is the integer value from user input, `cnt` contains all keys from the original `M` that had a value of 1, `T` is decremented by 1, `N` is a list of integers from the user input sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one integer. If `num` is greater than `cur`, `cur` is updated to `num` and `M` is updated to `{num: 1}`. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1 and `M` is updated to `{-1: 1}`.**
