Postcondition: **`cnt` is a list, `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `M` is an empty dictionary, `num` is greater than `cur`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1` (i.e., `num` is greater than 0), `cur` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1.**
