Postcondition: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the next element in `N` after the previously processed element, and `M[cur]` is updated as follows: if `num` > `cur`, then `cur` is set to `num` and `M[cur]` is set to 1; otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**
