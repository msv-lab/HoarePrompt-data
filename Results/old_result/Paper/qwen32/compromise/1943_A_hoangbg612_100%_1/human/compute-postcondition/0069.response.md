The code snippet `M[cur] += 1` attempts to increment the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. Given the initial state, `cur` is `-1` and `M` is an empty dictionary. Since `M` is empty, `M[cur]` does not exist, and trying to increment it directly will result in a `KeyError`. However, for the purpose of this task, we'll assume that the code implicitly creates the key `cur` with a value of 0 if it does not exist, and then increments it by 1.

Thus, `M[-1]` will be set to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is -1, `M` is {-1: 1}, `S` is the integer value from user input, `cnt` contains all keys from the original `M` that had a value of 1, `T` is decremented by 1, `N` is a list of integers from the user input sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one integer, and `num` is less than or equal to `cur`**.
