Postcondition: **`cnt` contains all unique elements from `N` that have a count of 1 in `M`. If `cnt` has at least 2 elements, `cur` is set to the second element of `cnt`. Otherwise, `cur` remains the last element of `N` if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`, or it remains unchanged. `T` is decremented by 1. `S` is an input integer, and `N` is a sorted list of integers.**
