To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze how the loop evolves with each iteration and how the variables `cur`, `M`, `S`, `N`, and `cnt` are affected.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `T`: Number of test cases.
   - `S`: An integer input for each test case.
   - `N`: A sorted list of integers for each test case.
   - `cur`: Initialized to -1, then updated based on the conditions within the loop.
   - `M`: A dictionary that maps each unique number in `N` to its count.
   - `cnt`: A list of keys from `M` that have a value of 1.

2. **Loop Iteration**:
   - For each test case, the list `N` is sorted.
   - The variable `cur` is updated based on the values in `N` and the dictionary `M`.
   - The dictionary `M` is built to count occurrences of each number in `N`.
   - The list `cnt` is populated with keys from `M` that have a count of 1.
   - If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, `cur` is set to the second element of `cnt`.
   - If the sum of values in `M` equals `S`, `cur` is incremented by 1.
   - The value of `cur` is printed at the end of each test case.

### Final Output State:
- **After all iterations**:
  - The variable `T` will be decremented by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 0.
  - The final value of `cur` for each test case is printed.
  - The variables `S`, `N`, `M`, and `cnt` are recalculated for each test case independently.

The final output state is essentially the value of `cur` after processing all test cases. Since `cur` is recalculated independently for each test case, the final output state after all iterations will be the `cur` value from the last test case processed.

### Output State:
Output State: **the value of `cur` after processing the last test case.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After all iterations of the loop, the final output state is the value of `cur` determined by the last test case processed. The value of `cur` is influenced by the sorted list `N`, the count dictionary `M`, and the list `cnt` of unique elements with a count of 1. If `cnt` has at least two elements, `cur` is set to the second smallest unique element. If not, `cur` is adjusted based on the sum of counts in `M` compared to `S`.
