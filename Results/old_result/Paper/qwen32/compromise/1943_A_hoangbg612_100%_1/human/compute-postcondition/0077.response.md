The code snippet `M[cur] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M` by 1. Given the initial state, `cur` can either be `num` or `-1`, and `M` can either be `{num: 1}` or `{-1: 1}`.

If `cur` is `num`, then `M[cur]` refers to `M[num]`, and since `M` is `{num: 1}`, `M[num]` is incremented from 1 to 2. Therefore, `M` becomes `{num: 2}`.

If `cur` is `-1`, then `M[cur]` refers to `M[-1]`, and since `M` is `{-1: 1}`, `M[-1]` is incremented from 1 to 2. Therefore, `M` becomes `{-1: 2}`.

The other variables (`S`, `cnt`, `T`, `N`, and `num`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is either `num` or -1; `M` is either `{num: 2}` or `{-1: 2}`; `S` is the integer value from user input; `cnt` contains all keys from the original `M` that had a value of 1; `T` is decremented by 1; `N` is a list of integers from the user input sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one integer; `num` is the next element in `N`.**
