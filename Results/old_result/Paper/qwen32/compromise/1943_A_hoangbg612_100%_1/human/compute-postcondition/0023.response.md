The code snippet `M[cur] = 1` sets the value of the key `cur` in the dictionary `M` to 1. The variables `T`, `S`, and `N` are not affected by this operation. The variable `cur` is equal to `num`, but since `num` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, we will assume `cur` is a key in the dictionary `M`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `cur` is now equal to `num`, and `M[cur]` is 1.**
