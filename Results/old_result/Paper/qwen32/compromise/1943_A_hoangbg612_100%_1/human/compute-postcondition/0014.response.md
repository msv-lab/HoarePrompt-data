The code snippet `M[cur] = 1` adds an entry to the dictionary `M` where the key is the current value of `cur` and the value is `1`. The other variables (`T`, `S`, `N`, `num`) are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4
- `S` is an input integer
- `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element
- `M` is an empty dictionary
- `cur` is equal to `num`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1.

After executing `M[cur] = 1`, the dictionary `M` will have a new key-value pair. The value of `cur` will still be the same as it was before the assignment, since `cur` is only used as a key in the dictionary assignment and not modified by it.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `M` is a dictionary with the key `cur` and value `1`, `cur` is equal to `num`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1.**
