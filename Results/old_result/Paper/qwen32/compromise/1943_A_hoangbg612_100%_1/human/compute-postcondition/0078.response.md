Postcondition: **`cur` is either `num` or -1, `M` is either `{num: 1}`, `{num: 2}`, or `{-1: 2}`, `S` is the integer value from user input, `cnt` contains all keys from the original `M` that had a value of 1, `T` is decremented by 1, `N` is a list of integers from the user input sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one integer, `num` is the next element in `N`. If `num > cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num`, `M` is updated to include `{num: 1}`, and if `num > cur + 1`, `cur` is further updated to `num + 1` or `0` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `num <= cur`, `M` is updated to `{num: 2}` or `{-1: 2}`.**
