The code snippet provided is `M[cur] += 1`, which increments the value stored at the index `cur` in the dictionary `M` by 1. 

Given the initial state, the variables `cnt`, `T`, `S`, `N`, and `num` are not directly affected by this operation. The only variable that changes is the value at `M[cur]` in the dictionary `M`.

Since the exact values of `M` and `cur` are not provided, we can only describe the change in terms of `M[cur]`.

Output State: **`cnt` is a list, `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least two elements, `num` is the next element in `N` to be processed, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**
