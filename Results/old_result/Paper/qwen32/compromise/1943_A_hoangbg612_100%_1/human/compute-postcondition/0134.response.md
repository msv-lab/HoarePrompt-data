Output State: **`cnt` is a list, `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least two elements, `num` is the next element in `N` to be processed, `cur` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the values of `cnt`, `T`, `S`, `N`, `num`, and `cur` remain as described, except that `cur` has been incremented by 1, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
