Output State: **`cur` is `num`, `M` is `{num: 1}`, `S` is the integer value from user input, `cnt` contains all keys from the original `M` that had a value of 1, `T` is decremented by 1, `N` is a list of integers from the user input sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one integer.**

In this output state, the dictionary `M` now has `num` as a key with a value of 1. All other variables retain their original values as described in the initial state.
