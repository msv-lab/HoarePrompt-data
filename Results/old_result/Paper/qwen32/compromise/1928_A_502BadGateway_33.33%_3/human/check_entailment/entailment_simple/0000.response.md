### Reasoning:

The problem asks to determine if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then rearranged to form a different rectangle. The key observation is that this is possible if and only if at least one of the dimensions of the original rectangle is even. Here's why:

- If both dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, then cutting the rectangle will result in two smaller rectangles with at least one odd dimension each. These smaller rectangles can only be rearranged to form rectangles with odd dimensions, which would be the same as the original rectangle (rotated or not).

- If at least one of the dimensions is even (say \(b\) is even), then the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles, each with one dimension being even. These smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions (not necessarily the same as the original rectangle).

The given program checks only if the dimension \(b\) is even and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' otherwise. However, this is not sufficient because the same logic applies if \(a\) is even. Therefore, the correct condition should be that at least one of the dimensions \(a\) or \(b\) must be even.

### Correctness:

Since the provided program only checks if \(b\) is even and does not consider the case where \(a\) is even, it does not correctly solve the problem for all cases.

**Correctness: False**
