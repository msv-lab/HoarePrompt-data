### Reasoning:

Let's revisit the problem and the program to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
Bob has a rectangle of size \( a \times b \) and he wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle. He then wants to form a new rectangle from these two smaller rectangles by rotating and moving them as needed.

For Bob to be able to form a new rectangle, the two smaller rectangles must be rearranged to form a different rectangle. The only way Bob cannot form a new rectangle is if he ends up with two identical \( 1 \times 1 \) squares, which can only form a \( 1 \times 2 \) or \( 2 \times 1 \) rectangle, which is considered the same as the original.

#### Key Insight:
The critical insight is that if either dimension of the rectangle is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle in such a way that he can form a new rectangle. Here's why:

1. **If \( a \) is even:** Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of size \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \). These two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of size \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) (if \( b \) is also even) or \( \frac{a}{2} \times 2b \) (if \( b \) is odd). Both of these are different from the original \( a \times b \) rectangle.
2. **If \( b \) is even:** Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of size \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \). These two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of size \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) (if \( a \) is also even) or \( 2a \times \frac{b}{2} \) (if \( a \) is odd). Both of these are different from the original \( a \times b \) rectangle.
3. **If both \( a \) and \( b \) are odd:** The only way to cut the rectangle is into two smaller rectangles of size \( a \times 1 \) and \( (b-1) \times 1 \) (or similar configurations). These two smaller rectangles can only form a \( 1 \times (a+b-1) \) rectangle, which is not different from the original \( a \times b \) rectangle (considering rotations).

#### Conclusion:
From the above analysis, we can conclude that Bob can form a new rectangle if and only if at least one of the dimensions \( a \) or \( b \) is even.

#### Program Analysis:
The given program is:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

This program only checks if \( b \) is even and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' otherwise. It does not check if \( a \) is even, which is necessary for the program to be correct.

#### Correctness:
Given the analysis, the program is incorrect because it does not account for the case where \( a \) is even and \( b \) is odd. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

### Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying that the program is incorrect because it only checks the evenness of \( b \) and not \( a \).
