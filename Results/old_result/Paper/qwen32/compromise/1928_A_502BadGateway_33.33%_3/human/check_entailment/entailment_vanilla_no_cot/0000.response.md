Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given a \times b rectangle. The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, which is not the correct logic for solving the problem.

To determine if Bob can form another rectangle, we need to check if the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then rearranged to form a new rectangle. This is possible if and only if at least one of the dimensions (a or b) is even. This is because if both dimensions are odd, the resulting smaller rectangles will all be 1x1, which cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle of different dimensions.

The correct logic should be:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print('Yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'No')
```
This checks if either `a` or `b` is even, which is the correct condition for Bob to be able to form another rectangle.
