You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6

    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

Bob has a rectangle of size \( a \times b \) and he wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle. Then, he wants to form a new rectangle from these two smaller rectangles by rotating and moving them as needed. 

For Bob to be able to form a new rectangle, the two smaller rectangles must be able to be rearranged to form a different rectangle. This means that the only way Bob cannot form a new rectangle is if he ends up with two identical \( 1 \times 1 \) squares, which can only form a \( 1 \times 2 \) or \( 2 \times 1 \) rectangle, which is considered the same as the original.

### Key Insight

The critical insight here is that if either dimension of the rectangle is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle in such a way that he can form a new rectangle. Here's why:

1. **If \( a \) is even:** Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of size \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \). These two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of size \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) (if \( b \) is also even) or \( \frac{a}{2} \times 2b \) (if \( b \) is odd). Both of these are different from the original \( a \times b \) rectangle.
2. **If \( b \) is even:** Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of size \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \). These two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of size \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) (if \( a \) is also even) or \( 2a \times \frac{b}{2} \) (if \( a \) is odd). Both of these are different from the original \( a \times b \) rectangle.
3. **If both \( a \) and \( b \) are odd:** The only way to cut the rectangle is into two smaller rectangles of size \( a \times 1 \) and \( (b-1) \times 1 \) (or similar configurations). These two smaller rectangles can only form a \( 1 \times (a+b-1) \) rectangle, which is not different from the original \( a \times b \) rectangle (considering rotations).

### Conclusion

From the above analysis, we can conclude that Bob can form a new rectangle if and only if at least one of the dimensions \( a \) or \( b \) is even. The provided program only checks if \( b \) is even, which is incorrect because it does not consider the case when \( a \) is even and \( b \) is odd.

### Program Analysis

The given program is:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

This program only checks if \( b \) is even and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' otherwise. It does not check if \( a \) is even, which is necessary for the program to be correct.

### Correctness

Given the analysis, the program is incorrect because it does not account for the case where \( a \) is even and \( b \) is odd. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
