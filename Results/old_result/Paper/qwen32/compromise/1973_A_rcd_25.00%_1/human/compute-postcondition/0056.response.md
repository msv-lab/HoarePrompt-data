To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations, let's analyze the behavior and conditions of the loop. The loop iterates while `high >= cur`, and in each iteration, it checks if `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`. If this condition is met, the loop prints `p1 - cur + p3` and exits. If not, `cur` is incremented by 1. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, it prints `p3`.

Given the conditions and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers with an odd sum.
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `cur` starts at `low`.

2. **After 1st Iteration:**
   - If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, the loop breaks, and the output is `p1 - cur + p3`.
   - Otherwise, `cur` becomes `low + 1`.

3. **After 2nd Iteration:**
   - If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, the loop breaks, and the output is `p1 - cur + p3`.
   - Otherwise, `cur` becomes `low + 2`.

4. **After 3rd Iteration:**
   - If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, the loop breaks, and the output is `p1 - cur + p3`.
   - Otherwise, `cur` becomes `low + 3`.

If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `cur` will be incremented until `cur > high`, and the final output will be `p3`.

### Final Output State:
- If the loop breaks at any iteration `i` where `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, the output will be `p1 - cur + p3` at that point.
- If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, the output will be `p3`.

Given the provided information, the loop will either break during one of the iterations or complete all iterations, resulting in one of the two outcomes. Since the problem does not provide specific values for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, we consider both possibilities.

However, based on the structure and the nature of the loop, the final output state can be generalized as follows:

Output State: **p1 - cur + p3 if the loop breaks, otherwise p3.**

In simpler terms, the final output will be the value of `p1 - cur + p3` if the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met during any iteration, or `p3` if the loop completes all iterations without meeting this condition.
