The code provided is simply a `break` statement, which exits the most internal loop or if statement. None of the variables `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`, or `cur` are modified by this statement. Therefore, the values of these variables remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` and `high` must be at least `cur`. If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1. `cur` must be less than `high`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
