The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply passes control to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Since there is no loop in the given snippet, `continue` has no effect in this context. Therefore, the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the value of `p3` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the value of `p3` remains unchanged.**
