The code snippet calculates the minimum and maximum of the differences between `p3` and `p1`, and `p3` and `p2`, and assigns them to `low` and `high` respectively. Given the initial conditions, we can determine the new values of `low` and `high`.

Since `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, both `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` will be negative or zero. Therefore, `low` will be the smaller (more negative) of the two differences, and `high` will be the larger (less negative) of the two differences.

Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.**
