To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the loop condition and the variables involved:

The `while` loop condition is:
```
while high >= cur:
```

From the problem statement, we know:
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `p3` remains unchanged.
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `cur` is initially set to `low`.

For the loop to execute, the condition `high >= cur` must be true. Since `cur` is initialized to `low`, the condition simplifies to `high >= low`, which is always true by definition of `low` and `high` as the minimum and maximum of the same two values, respectively. Therefore, no adjustments to `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`, or `cur` are necessary to ensure the loop executes at least once.

Thus, the state right before the loop can remain as provided.

State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` remains unchanged; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `cur` is equal to `low`**.
