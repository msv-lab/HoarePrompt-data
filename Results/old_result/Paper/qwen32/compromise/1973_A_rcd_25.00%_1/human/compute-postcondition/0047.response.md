To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(p1 - cur + p3)`, let's analyze the given initial state step by step:

1. **Variables and Their Definitions:**
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` must be at least `cur`.

2. **Expression to Evaluate:**
   - The expression to be printed is `p1 - cur + p3`.

3. **Analysis of the Expression:**
   - The expression `p1 - cur + p3` involves three variables: `p1`, `cur`, and `p3`.
   - The values of `p1` and `p3` are given as part of the initial state.
   - However, the value of `cur` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. It is only mentioned in the context of the `high` variable, which must be at least `cur`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the value of `cur` is not explicitly provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of the expression `p1 - cur + p3`.
   - However, we can describe the output in terms of the known variables and `cur`.

Therefore, the output will be described as follows:

Output: **p1 - cur + p3 (where p1 and p3 are the given integers, and cur is an integer such that high (the maximum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2) is at least cur)**
