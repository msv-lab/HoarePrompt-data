The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The initial state specifies that `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers within specific ranges and have certain relationships. After the execution of the code, the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will hold the values read from the input, and the initial constraints on `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` will no longer apply as they are reassigned.

Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input. The initial constraints on `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are no longer valid.**
