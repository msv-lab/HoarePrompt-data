The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, in the provided code snippet, there is no loop, so the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables `p1`, `p2`, or `p3`. Therefore, the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the current value of `p3` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `p3` remains unchanged as well.**
