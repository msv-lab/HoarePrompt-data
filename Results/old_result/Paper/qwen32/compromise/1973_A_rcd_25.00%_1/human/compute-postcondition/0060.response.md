The initial state provides information about the integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, and a condition that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. Additionally, there is a condition related to the value of `p3` compared to the sum of `p1` and `p2`. However, the provided Python code snippet simply prints `-1` regardless of the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

The print statement does not make use of `p1`, `p2`, or `p3` in any way. Therefore, the output will be `-1`.

Output: **-1**
