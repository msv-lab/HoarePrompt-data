Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` and `high` must be at least `cur`; `cur` is `cur + 1`.**

In simple terms: The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain the same as they were initially read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is still odd. The values of `low` and `high` remain the same, where `low` is the smaller of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is the larger of `p3 - p1`, `p3 - p2`, and must be at least `cur`. The value of `cur` is incremented by 1.
