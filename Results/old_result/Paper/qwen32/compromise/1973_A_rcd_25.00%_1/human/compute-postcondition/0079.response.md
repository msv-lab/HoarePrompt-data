To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers.
2. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
3. `p3` remains unchanged.
4. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
5. `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 1`.

### Variables and Expressions:
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are explicitly mentioned as integers.
- `cur` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the condition for `high`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(p1 - cur + p3)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Known Values and Relationships**:
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `p3` remains unchanged.

2. **Unknown Values**:
   - `cur` is not defined, so its value is unknown from the given information.

3. **Expression Evaluation**:
   - The expression to be printed is `p1 - cur + p3`.
   - Since `cur` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact value.
   - However, we can express the output in terms of `p1`, `cur`, and `p3`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `cur` is not defined, the output of the print statement can only be expressed in terms of the variables `p1`, `cur`, and `p3`.

Output: **p1 - cur + p3 (where p1 and p3 are integers and cur is an undefined integer)**
