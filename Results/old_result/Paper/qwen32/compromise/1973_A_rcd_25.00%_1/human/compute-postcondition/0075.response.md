Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` remains unchanged; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` holds true, `cur` remains equal to `low`. Otherwise, `cur` is set to `low + 1` and `p1 - cur` is greater than `p2 - (p3 - cur)`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms, the values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`, and `cur` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
