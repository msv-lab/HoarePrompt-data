The given code appends the element `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given the initial state, `ans1` already contains the last element of `b` twice. After appending `b[i]`, `ans1` will now contain the last element of `b` three times if `i` points to the last element of `b`.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` remains an integer greater than 2.
- `k` remains 0 if the original `k` was 0, otherwise it is twice its original value minus 2.
- `a` remains a list of integers.
- `b` remains a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`.
- `c` remains a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end.
- `ans1` now contains the last element of `b` three times.
- `ans2` remains an empty list.
- `req` remains equal to the new value of `k`.
- `l` remains an empty list if `b[0]` equals `b[1]` and `b[n - 2]` equals `b[n - 1]`, otherwise `l` contains the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, and the last element of `b` (`b[n - 1]`) if `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`.
- `b[i]` remains equal to `b[i - 1]` for the current value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `k` is 0 if the original `k` was 0, otherwise it is twice its original value minus 2; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end; `ans1` contains the last element of `b` three times; `ans2` is an empty list; `req` is equal to the new value of `k`; `l` is an empty list if `b[0]` equals `b[1]` and `b[n - 2]` equals `b[n - 1]`, otherwise `l` contains the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, and the last element of `b` (`b[n - 1]`) if `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`.**
