The code snippet `ans2.append(l[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `l` to the list `ans2`. This operation modifies `ans2` by adding a new element to it.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `ans2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` is either 0 or a negative even number, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicates of elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal plus `l[i]`, `ans2` includes all pairs of consecutive equal elements from `c` until `k` is exhausted plus `l[i]`, `req` remains the same, `q` remains the same, `l` must have at least one element. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
