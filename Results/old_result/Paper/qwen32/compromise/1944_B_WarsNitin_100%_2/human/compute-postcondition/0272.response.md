The given Python code snippet appends the element at index `i` of list `c` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 4, `c[4]` is appended to `ans2`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains the same.
- `n` is greater than 4.
- `k` is either 0, -2, -4, or `req - 4`.
- `a` remains the same.
- `b` remains the same.
- `c` remains the same.
- `ans1` contains duplicates of elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal.
- `ans2` includes two occurrences of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]` and additionally includes `c[3]` if `c[3]` equals `c[2]`. Now, `ans2` also includes `c[4]`.
- `req` remains the same.
- `q` remains the same.
- `i` is 4.

The only change is that `ans2` now includes `c[4]`.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` is greater than 4, `k` is either 0, -2, -4, or `req - 4`, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicates of elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal, `ans2` includes two occurrences of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]` and additionally includes `c[3]` if `c[3]` equals `c[2]`, and now includes `c[4]`, `req` remains the same, `q` remains the same, and `i` is 4.**
