Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicates of elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` remains the same, `q` remains the same and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables do not change, but we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
