The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `ans2`. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans1`). Therefore, the only change is the introduction of `ans2` as an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end; `ans1` is an empty list; `ans2` is an empty list.**
