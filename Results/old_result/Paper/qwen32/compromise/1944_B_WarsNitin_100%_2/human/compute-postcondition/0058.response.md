Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicates of consecutive elements from `b` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 or the loop completes, `ans2` remains empty, `req` equals 0, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not part of a consecutive duplicate sequence and are not the first or last element if they are repeated, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of any variables. Thus, all variables retain their initial values except that we note the occurrence of the break.
