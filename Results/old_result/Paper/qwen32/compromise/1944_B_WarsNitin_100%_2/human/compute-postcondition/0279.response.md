Postcondition: **`t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` is either 0 or a negative even number, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicates of elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal, `ans2` includes all pairs of consecutive equal elements from `c` until `k` is exhausted, `req` remains the same, `q` remains the same, `l` must have at least one element. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
