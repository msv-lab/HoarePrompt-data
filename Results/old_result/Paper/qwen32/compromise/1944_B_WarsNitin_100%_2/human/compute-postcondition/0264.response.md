The code appends `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 3, `c[i]` is `c[3]`. Therefore, `ans2` will now include `c[3]` as an additional element.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is either 0, -2, or `req - 2`, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicates of elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal, `ans2` includes two occurrences of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]` and now also includes `c[3]`, `req` remains the same, `q` remains the same, and `i` is 3. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
