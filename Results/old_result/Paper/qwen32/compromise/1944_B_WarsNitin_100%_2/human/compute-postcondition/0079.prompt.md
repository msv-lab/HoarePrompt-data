Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` is the value of `req`, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicates of consecutive elements from `b` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 or the loop completes, `ans2` remains empty, `req` equals the final value of `k`, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not part of a consecutive duplicate sequence and are not the first or last element if they are repeated.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either -2 (if `c[i] == c[i - 1]`) or retains its original value, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicates of consecutive elements from `b` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 or the loop completes, `ans2` contains `c[0]` and `c[1]` if `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, `req` equals the final value of `k`, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not part of a consecutive duplicate sequence and are not the first or last element if they are repeated, `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either -4 or retains its original value minus 2 if `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicates of consecutive elements from `b` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 or the loop completes, `ans2` contains `c[0]`, `c[1]`, and `c[2]` if `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, `req` equals the final value of `k`, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not part of a consecutive duplicate sequence and are not the first or last element if they are repeated, `i` is 2. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either -6 or retains its original value minus 4 if `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicates of consecutive elements from `b` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 or the loop completes, `ans2` contains `c[0]`, `c[1]`, `c[2]`, and `c[3]` if `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, `req` equals the final value of `k`, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not part of a consecutive duplicate sequence and are not the first or last element if they are repeated, `i` is 3. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
