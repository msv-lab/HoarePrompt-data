The given code snippet appends the element `b[i]` to the list `l`. Based on the initial state provided, we know that `l` initially contains elements from `b` under certain conditions. After appending `b[i]` to `l`, the only variable that changes is `l`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is either 0 or twice the second integer from the input minus 2 (decreased by 2 if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`), `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` contains the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` contains the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end sorted in ascending order, `ans1` is either an empty list, a list containing the `n-1`th element of `b` twice, or a list containing the `n-1`th element of `b` twice followed by `b[i]` twice if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` equals `k`, `q` is incremented by 1, and if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, `l` contains the element `b[i]` appended to it, `i` is incremented by 1. If `k == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Additionally, `l` now includes `b[i]` appended to it.**
