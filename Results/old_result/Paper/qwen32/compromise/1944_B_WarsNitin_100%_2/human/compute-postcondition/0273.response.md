The value of `k` is decremented by 2. Given that `k` was either 0, -2, -4, or `req - 4`, after the operation, `k` will be -2, -4, -6, or `req - 6` respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` is greater than 4, `k` is either -2, -4, -6, or `req - 6`, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicates of elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal, `ans2` includes two occurrences of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]` and additionally includes `c[3]` if `c[3]` equals `c[2]`, and now includes `c[4]`, `req` remains the same, `q` remains the same, and `i` is 4.**
