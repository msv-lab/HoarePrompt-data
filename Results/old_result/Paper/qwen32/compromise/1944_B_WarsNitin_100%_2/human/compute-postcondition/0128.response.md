Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is either -2 or twice the second integer from the input minus 4, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` contains the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` contains the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end sorted in ascending order, `ans1` is a list containing the `(n-1)`th element of `b` twice followed by `b[i]` twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` equals `k`, `q` is incremented by 1, and `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
