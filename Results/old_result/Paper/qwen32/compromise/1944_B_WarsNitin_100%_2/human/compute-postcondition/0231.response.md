Postcondition: **`t` remains the same, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is -2 if it was 0 initially and `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, otherwise `k` remains unchanged if `b[i] == b[i - 1]` or `k` is 0 if it was 0 initially and `b[i] != b[i - 1]`, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is `a[n:]` sorted in ascending order. If `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, `ans1` is a list containing the largest element among the first `n` elements of `a` repeated twice followed by `b[i]` twice. If `b[i] != b[i - 1]`, `ans1` is a list containing the largest element among the first `n` elements of `a` repeated twice if `b[n - 2] == b[n - 1]`, otherwise `ans1` is an empty list. If `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]` and `b[i] != b[i - 1]`, `l` is a list containing the largest element among the first `n` elements of `a` (and possibly the smallest element if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`) plus `b[i]`. `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is twice the second integer from the input, `q` is 1. If `k` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
