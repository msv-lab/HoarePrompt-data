Output State: **`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, `q`, and `l` remain the same; `k` is either -3 or a negative even number minus 5; `ans1` includes the element `l[i]`; `ans2` includes the new element `l[i]` appended to its previous contents; `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 1. Since `k` was initially either -2 or a negative even number minus 4, after decrementing, `k` becomes either -3 or a negative even number minus 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
