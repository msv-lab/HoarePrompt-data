To determine the output of the `print(*ans1)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and understand how `ans1` is constructed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `q` remain unchanged and their specific values are not provided.
- `k` is set to 0.
- `ans1` is constructed as follows:
  - It contains duplicates of elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal.
  - It also includes the first `|k|/2` elements of `l`.

### Construction of `ans1`:
1. **Duplicates of Consecutive Equal Elements from `b`:**
   - Since `k` is 0, there is no need to consider the first `|k|/2` elements of `l`.
   - We only need to focus on finding duplicates of consecutive equal elements in `b`.
   - If `b` has consecutive equal elements, those elements will be added to `ans1`.
   - If there are no consecutive equal elements in `b`, `ans1` will be empty.

2. **First `|k|/2` Elements of `l`:**
   - Since `k` is 0, `|k|/2` is also 0.
   - Therefore, no elements from `l` will be added to `ans1`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `k` is 0, `ans1` will only contain duplicates of consecutive equal elements from `b`. If there are no such elements in `b`, `ans1` will be an empty list.

### Output:
The output of `print(*ans1)` will depend on the contents of `b`. Since the specific contents of `b` are not provided, we can only describe the general form of the output.

Output: **(elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal, if any)**

If `b` does not have any consecutive equal elements, the output will be:
Output: **(no output, since `ans1` is empty)**

However, without the specific content of `b`, we cannot provide a more precise output. Therefore, the most precise description we can give based on the provided information is:

Output: **(elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal, if any)**
