### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem requirements.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list `a` of 2n integers.

2. **Splitting the List:**
   - The list `a` is split into two halves: `b` (first half) and `c` (second half).

3. **Sorting:**
   - Both `b` and `c` are sorted. Sorting helps in easily identifying pairs of identical elements.

4. **Building `ans1` and `ans2`:**
   - The program initializes `ans1` and `ans2` as empty lists.
   - It sets `k` to `2 * k` because the goal is to select `2k` elements in total.
   - It iterates through the sorted lists `b` and `c` to find pairs of identical elements and adds them to `ans1` and `ans2` respectively until `k` elements have been added to each list.
   - The variable `l` is used to store unique elements that appear only once in their respective halves (`b` and `c`). However, the logic for using `l` seems flawed as it doesn't ensure that the final XOR of `ans1` and `ans2` will be equal.

5. **Ensuring Equal XOR:**
   - The key requirement is that the XOR of elements in `ans1` should be equal to the XOR of elements in `ans2`.
   - The current implementation does not guarantee this. It simply selects pairs of identical elements and some unique elements but does not check or adjust to ensure the XOR condition is met.

### Issues Identified:
- The approach of selecting pairs of identical elements and some unique elements without checking the XOR condition is insufficient.
- There is no mechanism to ensure that the final XOR of `ans1` and `ans2` will be equal.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues, the program does not guarantee that the XOR of elements in `ans1` will be equal to the XOR of elements in `ans2` for all test cases. Therefore, the program is not correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
