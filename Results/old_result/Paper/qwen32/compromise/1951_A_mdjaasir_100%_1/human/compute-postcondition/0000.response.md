The value of `t` is assigned the result of `int(input())`, which means `t` will hold the integer value of whatever input is provided. The values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged and still satisfy the condition `start <= end`.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is the integer value of the input.**
