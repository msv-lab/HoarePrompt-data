The code assigns the value of `a` to `x`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the value of `t` remains an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains the new input integer, `inp` remains a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, and `a` remains the next element in `inp`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `inp` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `a` is the next element in `inp`, `x` is equal to `a`.**
