The code snippet `y = a` assigns the value of `a` to `y`. The values of `t`, `n`, `inp`, and `a` remain unchanged except for the introduction of `y` which is now equal to `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `inp` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `a` is the next element in `inp`, `y` is equal to `a`.**
