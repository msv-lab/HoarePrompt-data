The provided Python code snippet contains the statement `x == y`. This statement is a comparison and does not change the values of `x` or `y`; it simply evaluates to `True` or `False` based on whether `x` is equal to `y`. Since `x` and `y` are both initialized to `n + 1`, they are equal, and the comparison evaluates to `True`. However, this result is not stored or used anywhere in the provided snippet, so the values of `x`, `y`, and all other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State, with the addition of the fact that the comparison `x == y` evaluates to `True` but does not affect any variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `inp` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element; `x` is `n + 1`; `y` is `n + 1`; `ans` is 0; `a` is greater than `x` and `a` is greater than `y`**
