The provided code snippet `x == y` is a comparison operation and does not change any variable values; it only evaluates to a boolean value (True or False). Therefore, no variables are affected by this code. The output state will be the same as the initial state with the addition of the comparison result being True or False, but since it is not stored or used further, it doesn't need to be included in the output state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `x` is `a` if `a <= x` else `x` remains `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1` if `a > x` else `y` is `a` if `a <= y` else `y` remains `n + 1`, `ans` is 0 if `a <= y` else `ans` is 1, `a` is the next element in the list `inp`.**
