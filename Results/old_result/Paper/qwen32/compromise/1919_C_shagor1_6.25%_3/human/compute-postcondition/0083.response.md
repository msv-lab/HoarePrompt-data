The code snippet `y = a` changes the value of `y` to be equal to `a`. All other variables remain unchanged. Given that `a` is greater than both `x` and `y` initially, after this assignment, `y` will have the value of `a`.

Output State: **`iterations` must be one more than the number of completed iterations, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `x` is equal to `n + 1`, `y` is equal to `a`, `ans` is 0, `a` is greater than `x`, and `a` is greater than `y`.**
