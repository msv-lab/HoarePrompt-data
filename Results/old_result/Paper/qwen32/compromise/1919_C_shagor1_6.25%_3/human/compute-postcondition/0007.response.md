The value of `x` is updated to be equal to `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `inp` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element; `x` is `a`; `y` is `n + 1`; `ans` is 0; `a` is less than or equal to `x`.
