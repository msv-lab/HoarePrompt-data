Postcondition: **`iterations` is one more than the number of completed iterations, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 more element, `a` is the next element in `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `y`, then `y` is set to `a`. Otherwise, `y` is set to `a` and `ans` is incremented by 1.**
