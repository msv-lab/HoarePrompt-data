Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `inp` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element; `x` is `n + 1`; `y` is `a` if `a <= y` else `y` remains `n + 1`; `ans` is 0 if `a <= y` else `ans` is 1; `a` is greater than `x` if `ans` is 1, otherwise `a` is less than or equal to `y`.**
