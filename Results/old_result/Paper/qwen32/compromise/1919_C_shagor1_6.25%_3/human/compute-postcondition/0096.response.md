The variable `x` is assigned the value of `a`. The values of `iterations`, `n`, `inp`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `iterations` is one more than the number of completed iterations, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 more element, `a` is the next element in `inp`, `x` is the value of `a`.
Output State: **`iterations` is one more than the number of completed iterations, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 more element, `a` is the next element in `inp`, `x` is the value of `a`.**
