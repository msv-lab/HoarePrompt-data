The code snippet provided only initializes a variable `ans` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `inp`, `x`, `y`) are modified. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `inp` is a list of integers read from the input; `x` is `n + 1`; `y` is `n + 1`; `ans` is 0.**
