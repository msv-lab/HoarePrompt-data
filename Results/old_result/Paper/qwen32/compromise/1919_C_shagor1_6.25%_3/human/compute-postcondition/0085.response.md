Postcondition: **`iterations` must be one more than the number of completed iterations, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `x` is equal to `n + 1`, `y` is equal to `a`, `a` is greater than `x`. If `a` is less than or equal to `y`, `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is 1.**
