Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `input` is a string containing all the input data, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace, `idx` is `12 + n`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` followed by the string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, and the current value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2.**
