The code initializes a list `v` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `input` is a string containing all the input data, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace, `idx` is 2, `results` is an empty list, `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0.**
