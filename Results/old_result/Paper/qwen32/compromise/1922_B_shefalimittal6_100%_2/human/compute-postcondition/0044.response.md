The code snippet provided is `cnt += v[i]`. This line of code increments the variable `cnt` by the value of `v[i]`. 

Given the initial state, `cnt` is already defined as `cnt + v[i]`, which means `cnt` has already been incremented by `v[i]` at some point. Now, executing `cnt += v[i]` will increase `cnt` by `v[i]` again.

Therefore, the new value of `cnt` will be `cnt + v[i] + v[i]` or simply `cnt + 2 * v[i]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `input` is a string containing all the input data, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace, `idx` is `n + 2`, `results` is an empty list, `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `v[x]` is the count of occurrences of `x` in `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `cnt` is `cnt + 2 * v[i]`, `i` is `n + 1`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is increased by `v[n + 1] * (v[n + 1] - 1) * (v[n + 1] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
