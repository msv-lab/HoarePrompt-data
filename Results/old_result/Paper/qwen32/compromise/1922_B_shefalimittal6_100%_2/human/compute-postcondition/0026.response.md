Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `input` is a string containing all the input data, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace, `idx` is `n + 2`, `results` is an empty list, `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `v[x]` is the count of occurrences of `x` in `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, and all other elements reflect the counts of their respective indices, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0.**
