The code snippet provided appends the string representation of the variable `ans` to the `results` list. This means that the `results` list, which was initially empty, will now contain the string value of `ans` as its first element. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `input` is a string containing all the input data, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace, `idx` is `n + 2`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `v[x]` is the count of occurrences of `x` in `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `cnt` is the sum of all values in `v`, and `ans` is the accumulated sum of certain combinations based on the counts in `v`.**
