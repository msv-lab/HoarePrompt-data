The code snippet `x = int(data[idx])` updates the value of `x` by converting the string at index `idx` in the list `data` to an integer. Given that `idx` is 14, this means `x` is updated to the integer value of `data[14]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `data[11]` must be an integer greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `input` is a string containing all the input data, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace, `idx` is 14, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` followed by the string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the element at index `x` is 2 and all other elements are 0, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is updated based on the values in `v` according to the conditions given in the loop, `x` is the integer value of `data[14]`, `n` is greater than 1**.
