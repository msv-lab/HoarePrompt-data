The provided initial state describes several variables and their relationships, but it does not affect the `print('YES')` statement directly. The `print('YES')` statement is a straightforward print operation that outputs the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, or `z`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers derived from splitting and converting a string `s`.
- `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1` and not equal to `k - 1`.
- `z` is calculated through a loop that runs `x - k + 3` times, starting from `z = k - 2` and updating `z` in each iteration using the formula `z = z + (z // (k - 1)) + 1`.
- The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`.

Despite these conditions and calculations, the `print('YES')` statement does not depend on these variables. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Thus, the output is:
Output: **YES**
