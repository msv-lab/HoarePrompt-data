Let's analyze the given task step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. This indicates that `t` is a loop counter or a test case number, but its exact value is not specified.
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting and converting a string `s` from the next line of input. The exact values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are not specified based on the given information.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward. It will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`. These variables are not used in the print statement, so their values do not affect the output.

### Conclusion:
The output of the print statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
