Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. The function returns a value based on the conditions: Case_1: If `a` is less than `x`, it returns `x - a`. Case_2: If `a` is greater than or equal to `x`, it returns `0`.**
