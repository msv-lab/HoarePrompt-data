Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting and converting the string `s` from the next line of input, where `x > k - 3`; `z` is the value obtained by applying the loop's update rule `x - k + 3` times starting from `z = k - 2`; `i` is `x - k + 2`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` remains as it is. Otherwise, `a` is less than `z`.**
