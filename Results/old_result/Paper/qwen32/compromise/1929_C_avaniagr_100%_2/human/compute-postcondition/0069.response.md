To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how the variable `z` changes with each iteration.

The loop runs for `x - k + 3` iterations. Let's denote the number of iterations by `n`, where `n = x - k + 3`. The loop modifies `z` in each iteration according to the formula:
\[ z = z + \left\lfloor \frac{z}{k-1} \right\rfloor + 1 \]

Given the initial state, `z` starts as `k - 2`. The loop updates `z` in each iteration as described. Let's denote the value of `z` after `i` iterations as `z_i`.

From the provided output states after the first 3 iterations, we can see the pattern:
- After 1 iteration: \( z_1 = k - 1 + \left\lfloor \frac{k - 2}{k - 1} \right\rfloor + 1 \)
- After 2 iterations: \( z_2 = z_1 + \left\lfloor \frac{z_1}{k - 1} \right\rfloor + 1 \)
- After 3 iterations: \( z_3 = z_2 + \left\lfloor \frac{z_2}{k - 1} \right\rfloor + 1 \)

This pattern continues until `n` iterations. The final value of `z` after all iterations, `z_n`, can be described as the result of applying the loop's update rule `n` times starting from `z_0 = k - 2`.

Since the exact number of iterations `n` is `x - k + 3`, the final value of `z` after all iterations is `z_{x-k+2}`.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting and converting the string `s` from the next line of input, where `x > k - 3`; `z` is the value obtained by applying the loop's update rule `x - k + 3` times starting from `z = k - 2`; `i` is `x - k + 2`**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `z` will have accumulated the result of the loop's update rule applied `x - k + 3` times, starting from `z = k - 2`, and `i` will be `x - k + 2`, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations.
