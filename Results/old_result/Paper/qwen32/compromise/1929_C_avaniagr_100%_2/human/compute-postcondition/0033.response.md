The initial state describes the variables `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` which are derived from splitting and converting a string `s` from the next line of input. However, the `print` statement in the provided code snippet simply outputs the string `'YES'` without referencing any of these variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
2. `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers derived from the next line of input.
3. The `print` statement does not use any of these variables; it directly prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
