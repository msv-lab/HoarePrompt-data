Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting and converting the string `s`, `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1` and `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, `z` is the value obtained after `x - k + 3` iterations of the loop where `z` is updated as `z = z + (z // (k - 1)) + 1` starting from `z = k - 2`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `z`.**
