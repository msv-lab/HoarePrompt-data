Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting and converting the string `s` from the next line of input; `z` is `k - 2`.**

In simple terms, the variable `z` is now assigned the value of `k - 2`. All other variables (`t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
