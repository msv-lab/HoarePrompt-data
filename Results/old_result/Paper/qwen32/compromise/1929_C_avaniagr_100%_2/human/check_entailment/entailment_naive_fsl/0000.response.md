Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the logic and identify a potential issue.

The program checks three conditions for the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`:
1. If `x < k - 1`:
   - It checks if `a >= x + 1` and prints "YES" if true, otherwise "NO".
2. If `x == k - 1`:
   - It checks if `a >= x + 2` and prints "YES" if true, otherwise "NO".
3. If `x > k - 1`:
   - It calculates `z` and iteratively updates it based on the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x - k + 3` times.
   - It then checks if `a >= z` and prints "YES" if true, otherwise "NO".

However, the logic for the third condition is not entirely clear and may not cover all edge cases. Specifically, the formula used to calculate `z` does not seem to correctly account for all scenarios where Sasha can guarantee to have at least `n` coins.

Let's consider a specific test case to demonstrate the potential issue:
- Input: `k = 3`, `x = 3`, `a = 6`
- Expected Output: "YES"

According to the problem statement, Sasha can use the following strategy:
1. Bet 1 coin.
2. If he wins, he has 3 coins and can bet 1 coin again.
3. If he wins again, he has 6 coins and can bet 1 coin again.
4. If he loses, he still has 3 coins and can bet 1 coin again.
5. If he loses again, he still has 2 coins and can bet 1 coin again.
6. If he loses again, he still has 1 coin and can bet 1 coin again.
7. If he wins, he has 3 coins and can bet 1 coin again.
8. If he wins again, he has 6 coins and can bet 1 coin again.

In this scenario, Sasha can always guarantee to have at least 6 coins, so the output should be "YES".

However, the provided program will calculate `z` as follows:
- `z = k - 2 = 1`
- `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x - k + 3 = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3` times:
  - Iteration 1: `z = 1 + 1 // 2 + 1 = 2`
  - Iteration 2: `z = 2 + 2 // 2 + 1 = 4`
  - Iteration 3: `z = 4 + 4 // 2 + 1 = 7`

Since `a = 6` and `z = 7`, the program will print "NO", which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, and the correctness is **False**.
