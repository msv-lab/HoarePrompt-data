Output State: **`n` is the last integer in the newly input `qs`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `k` and `q` are the two integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 1, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `res` now contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.**

Explanation: The value of `n`, `p`, `k`, `q`, `t`, and `qs` remains unchanged. The list `res` has been updated to include the result of the function `func_1(n, p)`.
