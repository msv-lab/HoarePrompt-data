The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `qs` and the variable `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the last integer in the list `qs`. For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more integer in the list `qs`.

Let's denote the current `n` as `n_last`. Since `n` is the last integer in `qs` at the end of the previous iteration, the next integer in `qs` (if it exists) will be the new `n` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`n` is the next integer in the list `qs` after `n_last`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `k` and `q` are the two integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 1, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `res` now contains the result of `func_1(n_last, p)` appended to it.**

Since we don't have the specific values of `qs`, we can't specify the exact value of the next `n`, but we know it must be the next integer in the list `qs` after the current `n`.
