To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` is `n_next`
- `p` is a list of integers
- `k` is the first integer read from the input
- `q` is the second integer read from the input
- `t` is greater than 0
- `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least one more integer
- `res` has the results of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it twice.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `res`**: This is the key variable in the `print` statement. It is mentioned that `res` has the results of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it twice. This means `res` is a list that contains two identical elements, each being the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

2. **Function `func_1(n, p)`**: The exact behavior of `func_1` is not specified in the initial state, so we can't determine the exact result of `func_1(n, p)`. However, we know that whatever the result is, it will be appended to `res` twice.

3. **Printing `res`**: The `print` statement converts each element in `res` to a string using `map(str, res)` and then joins these string representations with a space `' '` in between using `' '.join(...)`. Since `res` contains two identical elements, the output will be the string representation of `func_1(n, p)` repeated twice, separated by a space.

### Output Description:
The output will be the string representation of the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended twice, separated by a space. Since the exact result of `func_1(n, p)` is not specified, we describe it in terms of the function's output.

### Final Output:
Output: **result_of_func_1 result_of_func_1 (where result_of_func_1 is the result of func_1(n, p))**
