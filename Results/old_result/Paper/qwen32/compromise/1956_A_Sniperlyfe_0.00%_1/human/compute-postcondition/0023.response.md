To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is the last integer in the list `qs`.
   - `p` is a list of integers.
   - `k` and `q` are integers read from the input.
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least one integer.
   - `res` contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.

2. **Code to Execute:**
   ```python
   print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
   ```

3. **Understanding the `print` statement:**
   - The `map(str, res)` function converts each element of the list `res` to a string.
   - The `' '.join(...)` function then joins these string elements with a space in between.

4. **Determining the Output:**
   - Since `res` contains the result of `func_1(n, p)`, we need to understand the output of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - However, the definition of `func_1` is not provided, so we can only describe the output in terms of what `res` contains.
   - `res` is a list that contains the result(s) of `func_1(n, p)`, which could be one or more integers, depending on the implementation of `func_1`.

Given the lack of specific details about `func_1`, we can't determine the exact numerical values in `res`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the contents of `res`.

Output: **[contents of res] (where contents of res are the result(s) of func_1(n, p) converted to strings and joined by spaces)**

Since we don't have the details of `func_1`, we can't specify the exact values, but we can provide a precise description of what will be printed based on the information given.
