To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `qs` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 3 integers.
   - `n` is the third integer in the list `qs`.
   - `p` is a new list of integers read from the input.
   - `k` and `q` are two new integers read from the input.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `res` is a list containing three elements, all of which are the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(' '.join(map(str, res)))`.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The list `res` contains three elements, each of which is the result of calling `func_1(n, p)`.
   - The `map(str, res)` function converts each element of the list `res` to a string.
   - The `' '.join(...)` function joins the string representations of the elements of `res` with a space in between.

4. **Output**:
   - Since the exact values of `n` and `p` and the function `func_1` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of the elements in `res`.
   - However, we know that `res` contains three elements, each of which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - Therefore, the output will be a string of three space-separated values, each representing the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

Based on this analysis, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **result1 result2 result3 (where result1, result2, and result3 are the results of func_1(n, p))**
