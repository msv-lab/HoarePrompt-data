The only variable in the loop head is `n`, which is being iterated over the list `qs`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the list `qs` must contain at least one integer. The state of `n` before the loop starts is irrelevant because it will be reassigned by the first element of `qs` during the first iteration.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a list of integers, `k` is the first integer read from the input, `q` is the second integer read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer**
