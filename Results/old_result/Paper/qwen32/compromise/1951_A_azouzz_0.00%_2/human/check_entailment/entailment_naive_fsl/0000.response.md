Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not follow the problem description at all. The problem description specifies a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)` that should:

1. Get all subfolders in the current directory.
2. Check if the subfolder names are digits and fall within the specified range.
3. For each qualifying subfolder, find all `.html` files.
4. Generate corresponding `-ac.py` and `-wa.py` files for each `.html` file.

However, the provided code is completely different. It defines a function `func_1()` that reads some input values, counts occurrences of the character '1' in a string, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions. This code has nothing to do with the problem description provided. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
