Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99; `k` is an input integer.**

In simple terms, the value of `k` is now an input integer, while the values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
