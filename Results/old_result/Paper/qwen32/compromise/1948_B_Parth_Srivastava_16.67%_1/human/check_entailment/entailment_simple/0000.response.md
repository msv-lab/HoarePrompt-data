Reasoning:  
The given program is intended to determine if an array can be sorted in non-descending order by repeatedly splitting elements greater than or equal to 10 into their constituent digits. However, the implementation in `func_1` has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem.

1. **Incorrect Handling of Splitting Elements**: The code attempts to split elements greater than 10 but does so in a way that doesn't always respect the order of digits. For example, if an element is 28, it should be split into 2 and 8, but the code does not correctly handle this for all cases, especially when the tens digit is greater than the units digit.

2. **Incorrect Comparison Logic**: The code compares the tens digit (`y`) with the units digit (`x`) to decide whether to insert the digits in order or the original number. This logic is flawed because it doesn't consider the context of the surrounding elements. The code should focus on whether the resulting array can be sorted, not on the individual digits' order.

3. **Incorrect Use of `c` and `n`**: The variables `c` and `n` are used to build the transformed array, but the logic for appending elements to `c` is incorrect. The code does not always append digits in the correct order or handle elements correctly.

4. **Sorting Check**: The code checks if the transformed array `c` is sorted. However, due to the incorrect construction of `c`, this check is unreliable.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted using the allowed operations.

Correctness: **False**
