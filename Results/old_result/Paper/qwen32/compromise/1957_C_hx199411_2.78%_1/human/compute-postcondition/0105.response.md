The code snippet increments the variable `num` by 2. Given the initial state, `num` is either 2 or 3 depending on whether `c` equals `r`. After the increment, `num` will be either 4 or 5.

Here is the detailed output state:

- `t` remains 1.
- `n` remains the first integer read from the input.
- `k` remains greater than 0.
- `c` remains the first integer read from the second input.
- `r` remains the second integer read from the second input.
- `i` remains 3.
- `num` is now 4 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise 5.
- `m` remains `n - 1` if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `n - 2`.
- `dp` remains a list of length `m + 1` with `dp[1]` as 1, `dp[2]` as 3, and `dp[i]` for `i` from 3 to `m` updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` if `m` is greater than 1.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `c` is the first integer read from the second input, `r` is the second integer read from the second input, `i` is 3, `num` is 4 if `c` equals `r` otherwise 5, `m` is `n - 1` if `c` equals `r` otherwise `n - 2`, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with `dp[1]` as 1, `dp[2]` as 3, and `dp[i]` for `i` from 3 to `m` updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` if `m` is greater than 1.**
