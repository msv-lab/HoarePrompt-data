In the given task, the for loop iterates over the range of `k`, which means the loop will execute `k` times. The loop head involves the variable `i` and the variable `k`.

To ensure that the loop executes, the value of `k` must be at least 1 because if `k` is 0, the loop will not execute at all.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is used as the loop counter and will automatically be initialized to 0 when the loop starts. Therefore, there is no need to adjust the state of `i` before the loop starts.

2. **Variable `k`**: This variable determines how many times the loop will iterate. For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Given the initial state, `k` is already defined as `0 ≤ k ≤ n`. To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state so that `k` is at least 1.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5); `k` is the second integer read from the input (1 ≤ k ≤ n); each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `num` is 0; `k` must be at least 1**
