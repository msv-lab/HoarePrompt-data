Given the code snippet `num += 1`, the value of `num` will be incremented by 1. Let's determine the new value of `num` based on its initial conditions.

- If `c` equals `r`, `num` was initially set to 2. After `num += 1`, `num` will be 3.
- If `c` does not equal `r`, `num` was initially set to 3. After `num += 1`, `num` will be 4.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, and `dp[2]` which is 3, and subsequent values computed using the loop formula, `c` and `r` are the integers read from the second input pair, and `num` is either 3 or 4 depending on whether `c` equals `r`.**
