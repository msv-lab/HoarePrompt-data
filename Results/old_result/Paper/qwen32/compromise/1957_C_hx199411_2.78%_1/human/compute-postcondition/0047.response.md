The code snippet `num = 0` sets the variable `num` to 0, regardless of its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is 0, `i` is `k + 1` if `m == 1`, otherwise `i` is `m + 1`, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, and `dp[2]` which is 3, and subsequent values computed using the loop formula.**
