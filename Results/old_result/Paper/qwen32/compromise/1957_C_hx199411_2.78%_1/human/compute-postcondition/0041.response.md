To determine the output of the `print(dp[m])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An integer between 0 and 10,000 (inclusive).
- `n`: The first integer read from the input, between 1 and 300,000 (inclusive).
- `k`: The second integer read from the input, between 0 and `n` (inclusive).
- `r_i` and `c_i`: Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers representing moves, where both integers are between 1 and `n` (inclusive).
- `num`: This variable is calculated based on the number of iterations where `c == r` (summing 1 for each) and `c != r` (summing 2 for each).
- `i`: Set to `m + 1`.
- `m`: Not equal to 1.
- `dp`: A list of length `m + 1` initialized to 0, except for `dp[1]` which is set to 1 and `dp[2]` which is set to 3. Subsequent values of `dp` are computed using a loop formula.

### Analysis:
The key part here is understanding how `dp[m]` is calculated. Given that `dp` is initialized with specific values for `dp[1]` and `dp[2]`, and subsequent values are computed using a loop formula, we need to understand this loop formula to determine `dp[m]`.

However, the problem statement does not provide the loop formula explicitly. Therefore, we can only describe the value of `dp[m]` in terms of how it is computed based on the given initial conditions and the loop formula.

### Output Description:
Given that `dp[m]` is computed based on a loop formula starting from `dp[3]` (since `dp[1]` and `dp[2]` are explicitly set), and without the exact formula, we can describe `dp[m]` as the result of applying this loop formula iteratively from `dp[3]` to `dp[m]`.

Thus, the output of `print(dp[m])` will be the value of `dp[m]` after applying the loop formula from `dp[3]` to `dp[m]`.

Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the value computed by the loop formula starting from dp[3] up to dp[m])**
