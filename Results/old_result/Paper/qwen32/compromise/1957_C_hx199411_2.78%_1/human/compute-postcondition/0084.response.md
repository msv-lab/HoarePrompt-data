Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the pairs `(c, r)` read during the `k` iterations, `i` is either `k` or `m`, `m` is `n - num` and can be 1 or greater than 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with `dp[1]` as 1, `dp[2]` as 3, and `dp[i]` for `i` from 3 to `m` updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` if `m` is greater than 1.**
