Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, and `dp[2]` which is 3, and subsequent values computed using the loop formula, `c` and `r` are the integers read from the second input pair. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is 2; otherwise, `num` is 3. If `c` equals `r`, `m` is `n - 2`; otherwise, `m` is `n - 5`.**
