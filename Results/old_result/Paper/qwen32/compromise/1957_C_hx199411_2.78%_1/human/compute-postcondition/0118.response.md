To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head is defined as:

```python
for i in range(3, m + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From this, we can see that the loop variable `i` ranges from 3 to `m + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, the starting value (3) must be less than or equal to the ending value (`m + 1`). Therefore, `m` must be at least 2.

Let's analyze the given state and identify what needs to be adjusted:

- `t` is 1: This variable is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need adjustment.
- `n` is the first integer read from the input: This variable is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need adjustment.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input: This variable is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need adjustment.
- `num` is `2k - count_equal`: This variable is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need adjustment.
- `m` is `n - (2k - count_equal)`: This variable is part of the loop head, so it needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute.
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with the first element being 1, the third element being 3, and all other elements initialized to 0: This variable is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need adjustment.

Given the above analysis, the only variable that needs adjustment is `m`. Specifically, `m` must be at least 2 to ensure the loop executes.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is `2k - count_equal`, `m` must be at least 2, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with the first element being 1, the third element being 3, and all other elements initialized to 0**
