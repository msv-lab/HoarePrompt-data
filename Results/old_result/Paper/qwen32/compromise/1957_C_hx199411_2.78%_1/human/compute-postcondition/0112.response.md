Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is `2k - count_equal`, `m` is `n - (2k - count_equal)`, and `m` is equal to 1. `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` which means `dp` has a length of 2. `dp[1]` is 1, and `dp[2]` is not yet calculated because `m` is 1, so the loop that updates `dp[i]` for `i` from 3 to `m` does not execute.**
