Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `c` is the first integer read from the second input, `r` is the second integer read from the second input. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 1, `m` is `n - 1`, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with `dp[1]` as 1, `dp[2]` as 3, and `dp[i]` for `i` from 3 to `m` updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` if `m` is greater than 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2, `m` is `n - 2`, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with `dp[1]` as 1, `dp[2]` as 3, and `dp[i]` for `i` from 3 to `m` updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` if `m` is greater than 1.**
