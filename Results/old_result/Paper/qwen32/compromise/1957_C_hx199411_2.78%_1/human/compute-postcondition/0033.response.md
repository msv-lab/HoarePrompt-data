To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which includes the variable `i` and the expression `m + 1`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(3, m + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
1. The starting value of `i` must be less than the stopping value `m + 1`.
2. Since the loop starts at `3`, `m + 1` must be greater than `3`.

Let's analyze the given state:
- `i` is `k + 1`.
- `m` is `n - num`.
- `m` is not equal to `1`.

Since `i` is `k + 1` and the loop starts at `3`, we need to ensure that `k + 1 < m + 1`. Simplifying this, we get `k < m`. Given that `m = n - num`, we need `k < n - num`.

Additionally, since the loop starts at `3`, we need `m + 1 > 3`, which simplifies to `m > 2`. Given that `m = n - num`, we need `n - num > 2`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- Ensure that `k < n - num`.
- Ensure that `n - num > 2`.

However, since we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head (`i` and `m`), we need to set `i` appropriately and ensure `m + 1` is greater than `3`.

Let's set `i` to `3` (the starting value of the loop) and ensure `m` is at least `3` to satisfy `m + 1 > 3`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5); `k` is the second integer read from the input (0 ≤ k ≤ n); each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`; `i` is 3; `m` is at least 3; `m` is not equal to 1; `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3.**

This ensures that the loop can execute as required.
