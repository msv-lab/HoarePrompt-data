The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a grid of size `n` and a series of `k` moves specified by coordinates `(r_i, c_i)`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the number of moves and their positions relative to the grid's diagonal. If all moves are on the diagonal, the result is `0`. If exactly one cell is off the diagonal, the result is `1`. Otherwise, it computes a more complex value using dynamic programming, which represents the number of ways to arrange the remaining cells under certain conditions, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
