To determine the output of the `print(i)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet. Here's the breakdown of the information:

- **Initial State:** `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
- **Code Snippet:** `print(i)`

The initial state does not provide any information about the variable `i`. Therefore, it is not explicitly defined or given a value in the provided information. Since `i` is not defined anywhere in the given context, attempting to print `i` will result in a `NameError` because `i` is not recognized in this scope.

However, since the task is to provide the most precise description possible based on the given information and to adhere to the format, we can state that `i` is undefined and thus will cause an error if executed.

Given the constraints of the task and the information provided, the most appropriate response is to specify that `i` is undefined.

Output: **NameError: name 'i' is not defined**
