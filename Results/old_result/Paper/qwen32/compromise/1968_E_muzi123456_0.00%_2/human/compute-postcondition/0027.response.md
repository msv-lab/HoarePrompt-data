To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the loop's behavior and how it evolves over time.

The loop in question is:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    print('1', end=' ')
    print(i)
```

This loop starts with `i` equal to 1 and iterates until `i` reaches `n` (inclusive). During each iteration, it prints '1' followed by the current value of `i`.

Let's break down the loop's impact on the variables:
- `t` is not used within the loop and remains unchanged.
- `n` is the loop's upper limit and remains unchanged.
- `i` is the loop variable and changes during each iteration.

Given that the loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`, it will execute exactly `n` times. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will have taken on all values from 1 to `n` sequentially.

The output state after all iterations will be:
- `t` remains the same as it was in the initial state (greater than 0).
- `n` remains the same as it was in the initial state (2 <= n <= 10^3).
- `i` will be `n + 1` after the loop completes because the loop variable `i` is incremented in each iteration and the loop terminates when `i` reaches `n + 1`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, where 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is `n + 1`.**

In natural language: After the loop finishes executing all its iterations, the variable `t` remains greater than 0, `n` retains its original value provided by the user (between 2 and 1000 inclusive), and `i` is equal to `n + 1`.
