Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, where 2 <= n <= 10^3 (though `n` is also not used in the provided code snippet).
- `i` is incremented by 1 (though the initial value of `i` is not specified).

Since the initial value of `i` is not provided, we cannot determine its exact numerical value before the increment. However, we know that `i` is incremented by 1 before the `print` statement is executed. Therefore, the printed value will be the initial value of `i` plus 1.

Let's denote the initial value of `i` as `i_initial`. After the increment, the value of `i` will be `i_initial + 1`.

Output: **i_initial + 1 (where i_initial is the initial value of i before the increment)**
