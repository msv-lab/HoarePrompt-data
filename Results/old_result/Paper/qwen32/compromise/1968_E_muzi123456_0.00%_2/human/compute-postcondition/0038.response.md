The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1, we need to adjust `i` to the next value it will take at the start of the next iteration. Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it means that at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1` from the end of the previous iteration.

The value of `n` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

State: **`n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, where 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, so `i` is now the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**.

To put it more clearly, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`.

State: **`n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, where 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is now the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**.
