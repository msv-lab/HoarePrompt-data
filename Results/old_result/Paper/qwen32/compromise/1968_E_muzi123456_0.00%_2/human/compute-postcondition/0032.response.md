To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the for loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `i` and `n`.

The for loop is defined as:
```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, because `range(1, n + 1)` will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive). The variable `i` is initialized to 1 in the first iteration of the loop and will take on each value in the range in subsequent iterations.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t - 1` (Note: `t` is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need adjustment for the loop to execute.)
- `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, where 2 <= n <= 10^3.
- `i` is `n + 1` using the new value of `n`.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, but since `n` is constrained to be between 2 and 10^3, this condition is already satisfied. However, the initial value of `i` is `n + 1`, which is outside the range of the loop (since the loop starts with `i` as 1 and goes up to `n`). Therefore, `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is re-initialized by the `range` function in the loop head.

Thus, the only state that needs to be ensured is that `n` is within the specified range (2 to 10^3), but since this is already provided by the user input constraint, no further adjustment is needed for `n` either.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, where 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is `n + 1` (no adjustment needed for the loop to execute)**

However, since the task specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, and `t` is not part of the loop head, we can simplify the state to:

State: **`n` is the new integer value provided by the user input, where 2 <= n <= 10^3**
