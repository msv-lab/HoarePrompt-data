To determine the final output state after the loop completes all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n` (inclusive), and during each iteration, it prints "1" followed by the current value of `i`.

Hereâ€™s the loop code for reference:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    print('1', end=' ')
    print(i)
```

The loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is provided by the user input and is between 2 and 1000 (inclusive). After the loop completes all iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n + 1` because the loop variable `i` increments by 1 in each iteration and the loop stops when `i` reaches `n + 1`.

The variable `t` is not modified within the loop, so its value remains unchanged from the initial state.

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations of the loop is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 49, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, where 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is n + 1**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing `n` times, the value of `t` remains the same as it was initially, `n` is still the user-provided integer between 2 and 1000, and `i` is now `n + 1`.
