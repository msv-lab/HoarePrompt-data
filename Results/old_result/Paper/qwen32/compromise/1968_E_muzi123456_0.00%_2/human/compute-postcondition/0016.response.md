The value of `t` is decremented by 1. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, where 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is n + 1, and `t` is now `t - 1`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, where 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is n + 1, and `t` is `t - 1`.**
