Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer; `c` is an integer; `d` is an input string.**

In this output state, the value of `d` has been updated to the value of the input string provided during execution. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `c`) retain their initial values.
