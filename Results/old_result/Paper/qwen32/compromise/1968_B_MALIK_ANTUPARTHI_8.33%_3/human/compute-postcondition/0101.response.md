To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to analyze the loop's behavior and the conditions under which it breaks. The loop iterates `b` times, and within each iteration, it checks if the character `d[j]` is in the substring `e[k:]`. If it is, `k` is updated to the index of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, the loop breaks. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, `k` is set to `j` and the loop breaks.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, let's consider the possible outcomes:

1. **If the loop breaks because `k == c`**: This means that at some point during the loop, `k` was updated to `c`, and the loop terminated early.
2. **If the loop breaks because `j == b - 1`**: This means that the loop completed all `b` iterations without `k` reaching `c`.
3. **If the loop breaks because `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`**: This means that at some point, the character `d[j]` was not found in the substring `e[k:]`, and `k` was set to `j`.

The final output state will depend on which of these conditions is met. However, we can generalize the final state as follows:

- The loop iterates `b` times, so `j` will be `b - 1` if the loop does not break early.
- `k` will be updated based on the conditions mentioned above.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` remain unchanged.

Let's summarize the final output state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` remain integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` remains an integer greater than 4.
- `b` remains the first integer from the user's input.
- `c` remains the second integer from the user's input.
- `d` remains the new input string.
- `e` remains the value of the user's input.
- `i` remains 4.
- `j` will be `b - 1` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking early.
- `k` will be the final value determined by the loop's conditions.

Based on the above analysis, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 4, `b` is the first integer from the user's input, `c` is the second integer from the user's input, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the value of the user's input, `i` is 4, `j` is `b - 1` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking early, and `k` is the final value determined by the loop's conditions.**

In simpler terms, the loop will either complete all `b` iterations or break early based on the conditions specified, and the final values of `j` and `k` will be determined accordingly.
