Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer; `d` is an input string; `e` is the value of the user's input; `j` is incremented by 1; `k` is `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `j`, and `k` remain as described in the initial state, with the exception that `j` has been incremented by 1 and `k` is now equal to `j + 1`. The program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
