The value of `k` is set to `j`, which is 5. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is the second integer from the user's input, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the value of the user's input, `i` is 3, `j` is 5, `k` is 5. If `d[4]` is present in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to `e.index(d[4]) + 1`. Otherwise, `k` is set to 4. The loop or if statement is broken out of if either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`.**
