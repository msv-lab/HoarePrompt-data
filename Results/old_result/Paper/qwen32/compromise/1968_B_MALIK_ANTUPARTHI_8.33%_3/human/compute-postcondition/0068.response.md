To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and identify the value of `k` based on the information provided.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `a` is an integer greater than 0.
- `b` is the first integer from the user's input.
- `c` is the second integer from the user's input.
- `d` is the new input string.
- `e` is the value of the user's input.
- `i` is 3.
- `j` is the last index processed before the loop breaks (which could be `b - 1`).
- `k` is the value it held when the loop breaks.

### Analysis:
The key variable here is `k`, whose value is determined by the loop's behavior. However, the loop itself is not provided in the code snippet. Therefore, we can only describe `k` based on the information given about it.

### Value of `k`:
- The variable `k` holds the value it had when the loop broke.
- Since the loop is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `k`.
- The description of `k` is that it is the value it held at the end of the loop.

### Conclusion:
Given the information, we can only describe `k` in terms of its definition and not its exact value. The print statement will output the value of `k` as it was at the point the loop broke.

### Final Output:
Output: **k (where k is the value it held when the loop broke)**
