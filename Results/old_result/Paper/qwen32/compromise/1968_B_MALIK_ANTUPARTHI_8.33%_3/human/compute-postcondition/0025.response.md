The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `b`. If `j` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its current value, and it must still be less than `b`.

Given that `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the value of `j` at the start of the next iteration will be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer; `d` is an input string; `e` is the value of the user's input; `j` is incremented by 1. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, `k` is set to `j + 1` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of; otherwise, `k` is set to the index of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, `k` is set to the incremented value of `j` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, `k` is set to `j + 1` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of; otherwise, `k` is set to the index of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, `k` is set to the incremented value of `j` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

To generalize, if `j` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `x + 1`.
