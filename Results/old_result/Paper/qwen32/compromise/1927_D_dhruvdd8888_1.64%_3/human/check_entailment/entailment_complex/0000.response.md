### Reasoning:

The given program appears to be designed to handle the problem as described but there are several issues that suggest the program is not correct:

1. **Function `func_1` does not handle the `ppp == 23` condition correctly:**
   - Inside `func_1`, there is a condition `if tc > 5: if ppp == 23: print(l, r); continue`. This suggests that for the 24th test case (`ppp == 23`), the program will print the `l` and `r` values of each query and skip processing the rest of the query. This is not aligned with the problem's requirements, as it should process all queries for each test case and provide the correct output for each.

2. **Incorrect handling of segments:**
   - The program uses `bisect_left` to find the segment that starts at or after `l`. However, it does not correctly handle the case where multiple elements within the range `[l, r]` are identical, and it doesn't ensure that the found segment meets the criteria of having different elements within the range `[l, r]`.

3. **Incorrect logic for printing the output:**
   - The output logic is flawed. For example, the condition `if s > l: if s == 1: print(-1, -1) else: print(s - 1, s)` does not correctly determine if there are different elements within the range `[l, r]`. Similarly, the other conditions do not ensure that the output is correct for all possible cases.

4. **Appending `-1` to `nums`:**
   - The line `nums.append(-1)` is used to ensure that the last segment is processed, but it might lead to incorrect results if the last segment of `nums` is already a single element and the appended `-1` is not part of the original array.

### Conclusion:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly handle all possible cases and does not provide the correct output for each query.

**Correctness: False**
