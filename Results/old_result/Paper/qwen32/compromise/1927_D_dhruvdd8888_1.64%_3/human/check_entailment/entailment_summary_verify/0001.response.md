### Reasoning

Let's systematically analyze the provided code and its behavior based on the problem description and the function summary. We will validate or challenge the original assessment using the function summary and the problem constraints.

#### Problem Overview
The task is to process multiple test cases, each containing an array of integers and a series of queries. For each query, we need to find two distinct indices within the specified range of the array such that the elements at these indices are different. If no such pair exists, we report `-1 -1`.

#### Code Analysis

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `N`, the elements of the array `nums`, the number of queries `q`, and then the queries themselves.

2. **Array Segmentation:**
   - The code segments the array into contiguous segments of equal elements. This is done using a loop that tracks the start `s` and end `e` of each segment and the value `num` of elements in that segment.
   - The segments are stored in the list `arr` as tuples `(start_index, end_index, value)`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the code uses `bisect_left` to find the segment that starts at or after the left boundary of the query.
   - The code then checks several conditions to determine if a valid pair of indices can be found:
     - If the segment starts after the left boundary, it checks if the previous segment can provide a valid pair.
     - If the segment ends before or at the right boundary, it checks if the next segment can provide a valid pair.
     - If the segment ends after the right boundary, it checks if the current segment can provide a valid pair.
   - If no valid pair is found, it outputs `-1 -1`.

### Issues in the Code

1. **Incorrect Query Handling:**
   - The code does not correctly handle all cases for finding a valid pair of indices. Specifically, it does not consider all possible segments that could contain a valid pair within the query range.
   - For example, if a query range contains multiple segments, the code might miss valid pairs that span across these segments.

2. **Incorrect Output for Some Queries:**
   - The code incorrectly handles queries where the segment starts exactly at the left boundary or ends exactly at the right boundary. It might output `-1 -1` even when a valid pair exists.
   - The logic for checking segments is flawed. For instance, if a segment starts at `l` and ends at `e`, and `e < r`, the code should look for a different segment starting after `e` to find a valid pair.

3. **Debugging Code:**
   - The code contains debugging prints that are conditionally executed based on the test case number. These should be removed or commented out for the final version.

### Example Analysis

Let's consider the example provided:

```
Input:
5
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
6
30 20 20 10 10 20
5
1 2
2 3
2 4
2 6
3 5
4
5 2 3 4
4
1 2
1 4
2 3
2 4
5
1 4 3 2 4
5
1 5
2 4
3 4
3 5
4 5
5
2 3 1 4 2
7
1 2
1 4
1 5
2 4
2 5
3 5
4 5
```

For the first test case, the segments are:
- (1, 2, 1)
- (3, 3, 2)
- (4, 5, 1)

For the query `1 5`, the code should find the pair (1, 3) or (3, 4) or (3, 5), but it finds (2, 3). This is correct.

For the query `1 2`, the code should find no valid pair, and it correctly outputs `-1 -1`.

For the query `1 3`, the code should find the pair (1, 3) or (2, 3), and it correctly outputs (2, 3).

However, for the second test case, the segments are:
- (1, 1, 30)
- (2, 3, 20)
- (4, 5, 10)
- (6, 6, 20)

For the query `1 2`, the code should find the pair (1, 2), but it outputs `-1 -1`. This is incorrect.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the query handling and output logic, the code does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
