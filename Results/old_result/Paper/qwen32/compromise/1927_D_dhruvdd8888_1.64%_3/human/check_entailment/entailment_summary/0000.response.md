### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the given program to assess its correctness.

#### Problem Understanding:
- We have an array `a` of `n` integers and `q` queries.
- Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r`.
- For each query, we need to find two indices `i` and `j` such that `l ≤ i ≤ r`, `l ≤ j ≤ r`, and `a[i] ≠ a[j]`.
- If no such pair exists, we should output `-1 -1`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the array itself, and the number of queries `q`.
   - For each query, it reads `l` and `r`.

2. **Processing the Array:**
   - The program constructs a list `arr` where each element is a tuple `(start, end, value)` representing segments of the array with the same value.
   - It uses `bisect_left` to efficiently find the segment that starts within the query range `[l, r]`.

3. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query, the program determines the segment that starts within the range `[l, r]`.
   - It then checks if there is a valid pair `(i, j)` within this segment or adjacent segments that satisfies the condition `a[i] ≠ a[j]`.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints the indices; otherwise, it prints `-1 -1`.

#### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Query Handling:**
  - The program does not correctly handle the logic for finding indices `i` and `j` that satisfy `a[i] ≠ a[j]` within the range `[l, r]`.
  - The conditions used to determine the pair are flawed. For example, the condition `if s > l` and the subsequent logic do not correctly identify valid pairs.
  
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle edge cases where the segment starts exactly at `l` or where the segment ends exactly at `r`.
  - It does not correctly handle cases where the segment spans the entire range `[l, r]` but all elements are the same.

- **Debugging Prints:**
  - The program includes debugging prints that are not relevant to the final solution and can be removed.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the required indices for each query. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
