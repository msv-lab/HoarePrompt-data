Postcondition: **`arr` contains tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`, `s` is the index of the last change in the sequence, `e` is 0, `num` is -1, `i` is `N`, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`. If `ppp` equals 23, then the conditions remain the same as described. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged as there is no else part.**
