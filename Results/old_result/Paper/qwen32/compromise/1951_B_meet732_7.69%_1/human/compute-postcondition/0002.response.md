The given code snippet initializes a variable `c` to 0. The variables `a`, `x`, and `ind` are not modified by this code snippet. The initial state of `a` includes multiple test cases, each with `n` cows' ratings, and `x` is the rating at index `k` of the current test case. `ind` is an empty list.

Output State: **`a` is a list containing multiple test cases, where each test case is represented as a list. Each test case list starts with two integers `n` and `k`, followed by `n` integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. `x` is the value of the element at index `k` of the current test case list in `a`. `ind` is an empty list. `c` is 0.**
