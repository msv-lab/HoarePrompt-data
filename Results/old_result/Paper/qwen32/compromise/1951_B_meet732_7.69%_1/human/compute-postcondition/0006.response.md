To determine the output of the `print(ind)` statement, let's break down the given initial state:

1. `a` remains the same.
2. `x` remains the same.
3. `ind` contains indices of up to two Cowdeforces ratings greater than `x`.
4. `c` is either 0, 1, or 2.
5. `k` is 14.

The variable `ind` is the one of interest here. It is described as containing indices of up to two Cowdeforces ratings that are greater than `x`. However, the specific values of `a`, `x`, and the Cowdeforces ratings are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact numerical indices in `ind`. 

Given this information, the most precise description we can provide is that `ind` is a list containing indices of up to two Cowdeforces ratings that are greater than `x`.

Thus, the output of the `print(ind)` statement will be a list of indices, but without the specific values of `a` and `x`, we cannot specify the exact indices.

Output: **ind (where ind is a list containing indices of up to two Cowdeforces ratings greater than x)**
