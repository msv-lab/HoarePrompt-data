The code modifies the variable `res` by adding the product of `math.comb(cnt, 2)` and `total_sum` to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `cnt`, and `total_sum` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2; if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, otherwise `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals `cnt`.**
