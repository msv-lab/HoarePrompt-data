The code snippet `res += math.comb(cnt, 3)` increments the variable `res` by the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 3 at a time, calculated using `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is calculated based on the value of `cnt` and `total_sum` and is now incremented by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals `cnt`.**
