The only object in the loop head is the variable `cnt`, which iterates over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `cnt` to the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.

Given that `cnt` is the current value from `num_of_lens.values()`, at the start of the next iteration, `cnt` should be set to the subsequent value in the iteration sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` held a specific value from `num_of_lens.values()`.
2. For the loop to execute again, `cnt` should be updated to the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`.

Since we are not given the specific values of `num_of_lens` or the exact current position of `cnt` in the iteration, we can only describe the state in terms of the next value in the sequence.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` to be processed. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is `2 * math.comb(cnt, 3) + 2 * math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. If `cnt` is 2, `res` is `2 * math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. Otherwise, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals `cnt`.**
