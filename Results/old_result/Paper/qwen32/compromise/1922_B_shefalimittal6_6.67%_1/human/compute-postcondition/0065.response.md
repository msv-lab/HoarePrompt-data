The code snippet modifies the variable `res` by adding the product of `math.comb(cnt, 2)` and `total_sum` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` to be processed; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals `cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is the original `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged; `res` is updated to `res + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.**
