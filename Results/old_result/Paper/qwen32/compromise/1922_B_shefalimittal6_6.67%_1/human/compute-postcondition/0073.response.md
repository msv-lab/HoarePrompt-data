To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. In the given for loop:

```python
for x in nums:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `x`, and it iterates over the elements of the list `nums`. Therefore, the state of `nums` is what needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute.

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if and only if `nums` is not empty.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `res`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

### Adjustment:
- Ensure that `nums` contains at least one element.

### Final State:
Given the above analysis, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `nums` is not empty. Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least one element; `res` is the sum of math.comb(cnt, 3) for all cnt ≥ 3 and math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum for all cnt ≥ 2, where total_sum is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals cnt.**

This ensures that the loop can execute by having at least one element in `nums` to iterate over.
