Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals `cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is calculated based on the value of `cnt` and `total_sum` and is incremented by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.**
