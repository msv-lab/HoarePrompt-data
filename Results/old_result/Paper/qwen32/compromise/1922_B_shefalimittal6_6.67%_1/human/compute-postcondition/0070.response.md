Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each unique integer x from `nums` has a count of how many times it appears; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is the sum of math.comb(cnt, 3) for all cnt ≥ 3 and math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum for all cnt ≥ 2, where total_sum is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals cnt.**

In simple terms, the variable `n` is now assigned the value of the input integer. All other variables remain unchanged.
