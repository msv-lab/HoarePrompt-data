The only variable in the loop head is `cnt`, which iterates over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`. Therefore, the state of `num_of_lens` is the only one that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute.

For the loop to execute, `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair, meaning there must be at least one unique element in the `nums` list with a corresponding count.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is `n - 1`, `n` is the input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least one unique element, `res` is 0**
