The code snippet provided initializes a variable `res` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `nums` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `nums`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is 0.**
