Output State: **The output state consists of t lines, each representing the total cost of selling n buns given the usual price a and the modified price b for the first k buns, where k is the minimum of n and the difference between b and a. If b is less than or equal to a, the total cost is simply n multiplied by a. Otherwise, the total cost is calculated as the sum of the arithmetic series for the first k buns at the modified price plus the cost of the remaining (n-k) buns at the usual price.**
