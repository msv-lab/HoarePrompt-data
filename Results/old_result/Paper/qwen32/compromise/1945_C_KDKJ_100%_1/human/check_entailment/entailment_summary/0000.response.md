### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided code and its behavior based on the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: To find the optimal position `i` to place the road such that at least half of the residents on each side of the road are satisfied with their side.
- **Approach**:
  - It reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's.
  - It initializes a list `S` with a single element `[0, 0]` to keep track of the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to each position.
  - It iterates through the string `a` and updates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's, appending these counts to `S`.
  - It then iterates over possible positions `i` where the road can be placed (from `0` to `n`).
  - For each position `i`, it calculates:
    - `left`: the number of '0's on the left side (`S[i][0]`).
    - `lsum`: the total number of houses on the left side (`i`).
    - `right`: the number of '1's on the right side (`S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`).
    - `rsum`: the total number of houses on the right side (`n - i`).
  - It checks if placing the road at position `i` satisfies the conditions:
    - At least half of the residents on the left side want to live on the left (`left * 2 < lsum`).
    - At least half of the residents on the right side want to live on the right (`right * 2 < rsum`).
  - If the conditions are met and `i` is closer to the middle of the village than the current best position, it updates the best position `ans`.
- **Output**: Prints the optimal position `ans`.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: To handle multiple test cases.
- **Approach**:
  - It reads the number of test cases.
  - It calls `func_1` for each test case.
- **Output**: None, as `func_1` handles the printing of results.

### Evaluation:
- The logic in `func_1` correctly implements the problem requirements. It calculates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's and checks the conditions for each possible position `i`.
- The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each one.
- The code is efficient enough given the constraints (up to 20,000 test cases with a total of 300,000 characters across all test cases).

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly solves the problem as described. It meets all the requirements and handles the edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
