The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it outputs either a list of `k` integers where each integer is `k`, or `-1`, based on the conditions: if `k` is at least 2 and `n` equals `k`, it outputs the list; otherwise, it outputs `-1`. If `k` is less than 2, it outputs a list of the first `n` positive integers.
