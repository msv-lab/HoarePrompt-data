### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Recap
- We need to find an array \(a\) of length \(n\) such that exactly \(k\) of its cyclic shifts are sorted.
- If no such array exists, we return `-1`.

#### Program Analysis
The provided program handles the following cases:
1. **Case where \(k \geq 2\) and \(n = k\)**:
   - Outputs an array where all elements are \(k\), i.e., \([k, k, \ldots, k]\).
   - This is correct because all cyclic shifts of such an array are identical and sorted.

2. **Case where \(k \geq 2\) and \(n \neq k\)**:
   - Outputs `-1`.
   - This is incorrect because there can be valid arrays for \(2 \leq k < n\).

3. **Case where \(k = 1\)**:
   - Outputs a strictly increasing sequence \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\).
   - This is correct because the only sorted cyclic shift will be the array itself, and all other cyclic shifts will not be sorted.

#### Validation with Function Summary
The function summary correctly describes the program's behavior for the cases it handles:
- For \(k \geq 2\) and \(n = k\), it outputs \([k, k, \ldots, k]\).
- For \(k \geq 2\) and \(n \neq k\), it outputs `-1`.
- For \(k = 1\), it outputs \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\).

However, the summary does not cover the scenario where \(2 \leq k < n\), which can have valid solutions.

#### Counterexample
The original assessment provides a counterexample:
- For \(n = 3\) and \(k = 2\), the program outputs `-1`, but a valid array is `[1, 2, 1]` because its cyclic shifts are:
  - \([1, 2, 1]\) (sorted),
  - \([2, 1, 1]\) (sorted),
  - \([1, 1, 2]\) (not sorted).

This counterexample demonstrates that the program fails to handle cases where \(2 \leq k < n\).

### Conclusion
The program does not handle all cases correctly, specifically those where \(2 \leq k < n\). Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
