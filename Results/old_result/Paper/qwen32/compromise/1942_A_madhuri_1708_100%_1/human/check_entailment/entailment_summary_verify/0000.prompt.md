You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[j + 1 for j in range(n)])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it outputs either a list of `k` integers where each integer is `k`, or `-1`, based on the conditions: if `k` is at least 2 and `n` equals `k`, it outputs the list; otherwise, it outputs `-1`. If `k` is less than 2, it outputs a list of the first `n` positive integers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to provide a valid array for certain values of `n` and `k` where `k` is neither 1 nor equal to `n`.

Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Case where `k >= 2` and `n != k`**:
   - The program outputs `-1` in this case.
   - However, there can be valid arrays for `k >= 2` and `n != k`. For example, for `n = 3` and `k = 2`, a valid array could be `[1, 2, 1]` because its cyclic shifts are `[1, 2, 1]` (sorted) and `[2, 1, 1]` (sorted), and `[1, 1, 2]` (not sorted).

2. **Case where `k = 1`**:
   - The program outputs a strictly increasing sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - This is correct because the only sorted cyclic shift will be the array itself, and all other cyclic shifts will not be sorted.

3. **Case where `k = n`**:
   - The program outputs an array where all elements are the same, `[k, k, ..., k]`.
   - This is correct because all cyclic shifts of such an array are identical and sorted.

The provided program does not cover the scenario where `2 <= k < n`, which can have valid solutions as explained in the first point. Therefore, the program is incorrect for these cases.

**Counterexample**:
For `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the program outputs `-1`, but a valid array is `[1, 2, 1]` as explained above.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
