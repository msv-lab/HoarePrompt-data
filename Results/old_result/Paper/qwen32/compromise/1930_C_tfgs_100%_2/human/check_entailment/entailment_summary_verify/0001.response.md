### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and compare it against the problem requirements and the given function summary.

#### Problem Recap:
1. We have an array `a` of length `n` and an empty set `S`.
2. We perform the following operations `n` times:
   - Select an index `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ |a|).
   - Insert `a[i] + i` into `S`.
   - Delete `a[i]` from `a`.
3. After `n` operations, `a` will be empty.
4. We construct a new array `b` which is `S` sorted in decreasing order.
5. We need to find the lexicographically largest `b` that can be made.

#### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Selection of Index `i`:**
   - The program does not explicitly implement any strategy to select the index `i` such that `a[i] + i` is maximized in each step. Instead, it simply adds `a[i] + i` for all `i` in a loop. This is not optimal for achieving the lexicographically largest `b`.

2. **Handling of Duplicates:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to keep track of occurrences of elements in `a` after adding `i`. It then sorts the unique elements and appends additional elements based on some logic. However, this logic does not guarantee the optimal `b`. The program should ensure that the highest possible values are inserted into `S` first.

3. **Constructing `b`:**
   - The program sorts the unique elements in decreasing order and then appends additional elements based on the count of duplicates. This approach does not guarantee that the resulting `b` is the lexicographically largest possible.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
- Select the index `i` such that `a[i] + i` is maximized in each step.
- Insert `a[i] + i` into `S`.
- Delete `a[i]` from `a`.
- After all operations, sort `S` in decreasing order to get `b`.

The program should implement a strategy to always choose the maximum possible value of `a[i] + i` in each step.

#### Evaluation of the Given Program:
- The provided program does not implement the optimal strategy for selecting `i` to maximize `b`.
- The program's approach of simply adding `a[i] + i` for all `i` and then sorting the unique elements does not ensure the lexicographically largest `b`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the program's logic and the fact that it does not implement the correct strategy for selecting `i` to maximize `b`, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
