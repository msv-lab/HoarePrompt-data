Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), which is the length of the array a. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), which are the elements of the array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
