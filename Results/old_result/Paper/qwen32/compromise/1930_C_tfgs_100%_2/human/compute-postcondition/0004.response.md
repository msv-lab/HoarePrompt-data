The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the first element of `a` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**
