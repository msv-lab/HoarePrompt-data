Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `i` is increased by `i + 1`.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes executing all iterations, each element in the list `a` will have been incremented by its 1-based index value. For example, the first element (index 0) will be increased by 1, the second element (index 1) will be increased by 2, and so on, up to the `n`-th element (index `n-1`) which will be increased by `n`.
