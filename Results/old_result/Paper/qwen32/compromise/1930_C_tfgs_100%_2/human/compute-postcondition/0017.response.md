Output State: **`a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least one element, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the counts of each element in the original list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is an empty list, and `i` is greater than 0; `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`**

Natural Language: The value of `adv` is determined by the minimum of three values: the difference between the `i-1`th and `i`th elements of `a` minus one, `cnt`, and `cur`. The other variables remain unchanged.
