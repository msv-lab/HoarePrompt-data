The code snippet `cur -= adv` decrements the value of `cur` by the value of `adv`. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`adv` will be a positive integer; `ans` will have `adv` new elements appended, which are `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` ranging from 0 to `adv - 1`; `j` will range from 0 to `adv - 1`; `cnt` is decreased by `adv`; `cur` is decreased by `adv`; other variables like `a`, `counter`, `i` remain unchanged.**

In natural language: `adv` remains a positive integer, `ans` has `adv` new elements appended as described, `j` ranges from 0 to `adv - 1`, `cnt` is decreased by `adv`, and `cur` is decreased by `adv`. All other variables (`a`, `counter`, `i`) remain unchanged.
