Postcondition: **`a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the counts of each element in the original list `a`, `cur` is updated to `cur - adv` if `i > 0`, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - adv` if `i > 0`, `ans` is a list with `adv` elements, each equal to `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` from 0 to `adv - 1` if `i > 0`, where `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt)`. If `i` is not greater than 0, `cur`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged.**
