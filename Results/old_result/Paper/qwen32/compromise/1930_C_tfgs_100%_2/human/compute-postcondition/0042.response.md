Postcondition: **`a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object with the count of `a[i]` decremented by 1, `cur` is updated to `cur + counter[a[i]]`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `i > 0`, `adv` is a positive integer, `ans` has `adv` new elements appended, which are `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` ranging from 0 to `adv - 1`, `cnt` is decreased by `adv`, and `cur` is decreased by `adv`. If `i` is not greater than 0, `cnt` and `cur` remain unchanged except `ans` now includes `a[i]`.**
