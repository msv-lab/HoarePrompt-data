The code snippet appends a calculated value to the list `ans`. The value being appended is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`. Given that `j` is `j + 1` in the initial state, we need to ensure that the calculation reflects this updated value of `j`.

Since `j` is `j + 1` in the initial state, the expression `a[i - 1] - j - 1` becomes `a[i - 1] - (j + 1) - 1`, which simplifies to `a[i - 1] - j - 2`.

The precondition `adv > j + 1` still holds after the code execution, as the value of `adv` is not changed by the code snippet.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`adv` must be greater than `j + 1`; `j` is `j + 1`; `ans` has a new element `a[i - 1] - j - 2` appended to it.**
