The given code snippet appends the `i`-th element of the list `a` to the list `ans`. This means that the length of `ans` will increase by 1, and the last element of `ans` will be `a[i]`.

Let's break down the changes:
- The list `ans` will have an additional element, which is `a[i]`.
- The other variables (`a`, `counter`, `cur`, `cnt`, and `i`) remain unchanged unless `i > 0` and their specific conditions are met, but since we are only appending `a[i]` to `ans`, only `ans` is affected.

Output State: **`a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the counts of each element in the original list `a`, `cur` is updated to `cur - adv` if `i > 0`, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - adv` if `i > 0`, `ans` is a list with `adv` elements, each equal to `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` from 0 to `adv - 1` if `i > 0`, and an additional element `a[i]` appended to it. If `i` is not greater than 0, `cur`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged except `ans` now includes `a[i]`.**
