The code snippet creates a `Counter` object named `counter` from the list `a`. The `Counter` object will count the occurrences of each element in the list `a`. The initial state describes `a` as a list of `n` integers where each element at index `i` is increased by `i + 1`. This condition remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `i` is increased by `i + 1`; `counter` is a Counter object that contains the counts of each element in `a`.**
