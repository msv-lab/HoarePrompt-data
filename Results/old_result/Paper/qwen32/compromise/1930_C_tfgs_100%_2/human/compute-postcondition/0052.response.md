The only variable in the loop head is `j` and `adv`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `adv`. If `j` is less than `adv`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `adv` must be greater than `j + 1`, and `j` is `j + 1`. This means that at the start of the next iteration, `j` will already have been incremented by 1 from the previous iteration. Therefore, `j` should be incremented by 1 again to reflect the start of the next iteration.

So, `j` should be `j + 1` from its current value (which is already `j + 1` from the previous iteration), making it `j + 2` relative to the value of `j` at the start of the previous iteration. The condition `adv` must be greater than `j + 1` should still hold.

State: **`adv` must be greater than `j + 2`; `j` is `j + 2`; `ans` has a new element `a[i - 1] - j - 2` appended to it.**

However, since `j` is already `j + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, we should simply reflect that `j` is now `j + 1` at the start of the next iteration, and `adv` must still be greater than this new value of `j + 1`.

So the correct state should be:

State: **`adv` must be greater than `j + 1`; `j` is `j + 1`; `ans` has a new element `a[i - 1] - j - 2` appended to it.**

But to reflect the start of the next iteration correctly:

State: **`adv` must be greater than `j + 1`; `j` is `j + 1`;**
