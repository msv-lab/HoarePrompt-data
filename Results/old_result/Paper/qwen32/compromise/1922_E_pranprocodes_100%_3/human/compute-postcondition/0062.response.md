The code snippet `x -= 1` decrements the value of `x` by 1. Given that `x` is an input integer not equal to 1 and initially even, its new value will be odd and one less than its initial value.

The other variables (`max`, `min`, `ans`, `t`, `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer not equal to 1 and is now odd, `max` is `99999999`, `min` is `-99999999` or `-99999998`, `ans` is `[100000000, -100000000]` or `[-100000000, -99999999]`, `t` is `1`, `i` is `2`.**
