The value of `x` is halved using integer division. Since `x` is initially an even integer greater than 1, after the operation `x` will still be an integer, and its value will be exactly half of its original value. The other variables (`max`, `min`, `ans`, and `t`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer input value that is greater than 1 and even (specifically, `x` is now `x // 2`); `max` is 99999999; `min` is -100000000; `ans` is a list containing the value 100000000; `t` is 0.**
