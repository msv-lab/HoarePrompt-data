Output State: **`x` is an integer not equal to 1, `max` is 99999998 if `x` is even, `max` is 99999999 if `x` is odd, `min` is -99999999 if `x` is even, `min` is -99999998 if `x` is odd, `ans` is [100000000, 99999999, 99999998] if `x` is even, `ans` is [100000000, -99999999, 99999999] if `x` is odd, or `ans` is [-100000000, -100000000, 99999999] if `x` is 0, `t` is 2, `i` is 3**.

In natural language: The value of `ans` has been updated to include `max` at the end, while the values of `x`, `max`, `min`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged.
