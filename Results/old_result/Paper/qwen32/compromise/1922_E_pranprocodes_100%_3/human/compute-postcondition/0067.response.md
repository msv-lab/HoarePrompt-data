The code snippet `max -= 1` decrements the value of the variable `max` by 1. The variable `x` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. The initial state mentions that `ans` contains the `max` function, but since `max` is being treated as a variable in this context, `ans` is not affected by this operation either.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer not equal to 1; `max` is decremented by 1; `ans` contains the `max` function.**
