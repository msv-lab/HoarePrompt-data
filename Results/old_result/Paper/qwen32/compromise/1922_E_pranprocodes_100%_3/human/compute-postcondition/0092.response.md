The value of `x` is decremented by 1, so if `x` was an odd integer, it will now be an even integer. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is [-100000000], `t` is 0, `i` is 3, and `x` is an even integer.**
