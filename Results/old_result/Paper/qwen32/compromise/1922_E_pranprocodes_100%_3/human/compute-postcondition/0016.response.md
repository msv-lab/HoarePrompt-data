Output State: **`x` is an integer input value that is greater than 1. If `x` is even, `x` is now `x // 2`, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing the value 100000000, and `t` is 1. If `x` is odd, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing the value -100000000, and `t` is 1.**

In simpler terms, the variable `t` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values based on whether `x` is even or odd.
