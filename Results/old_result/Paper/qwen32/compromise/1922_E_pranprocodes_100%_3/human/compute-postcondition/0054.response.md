Postcondition: **`x` is an input integer not equal to 1. If `x` is even, `x` is now half of its initial value, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [100000000], `t` is 0, `i` is 2. Otherwise, `x` is not divisible by 2, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing `[-100000000]`, `t` is 0, `i` is 2.**
