The value of `x` is updated to the integer value of the input provided. The other variables `max`, `min`, `ans`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is the input integer, `max` is `100000000 - t_e`, `min` is `-100000000 + t_o`, `ans` is a list of `t` elements where each element is either `max` or `min` depending on whether `x` was even or odd in that iteration, but in reversed order, `t` is the total number of iterations, `i` is 3.

Output State: **`x` is the input integer, `max` is `100000000 - t_e`, `min` is `-100000000 + t_o`, `ans` is a list of `t` elements where each element is either `max` or `min` depending on whether `x` was even or odd in that iteration, but in reversed order, `t` is the total number of iterations, `i` is 3**.
