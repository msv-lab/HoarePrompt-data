Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is an integer input value that is at least 1; `max` is 100000000; `min` is -100000000; `ans` is an empty list; `t` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while x != 1:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        ans.append(max)
        max -= 1
        x = x // 2
    else:
        ans.append(min)
        min += 1
        x -= 1
    t += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is an integer input value that is greater than 1. If `x` is even, `x` is now `x // 2`, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing the value 100000000, and `t` is 1. If `x` is odd, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing the value -100000000, and `t` is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `x` is an integer that has been either halved if it was even or decremented by 1 if it was odd. `max` is 99999998 if `x` was even, and 100000000 if `x` was odd. `min` is -100000000 if `x` was even and `x` was originally even, -99999999 if `x` was odd or `x` was originally odd. `ans` is a list containing the value 100000000 and 99999999 if `x` was even, or 100000000 and `min` if `x` was odd and `x` was originally even, or -100000000 and 99999999 if `x` was odd and `x` was originally odd, or -100000000 and `min` if `x` was odd and `x` was originally odd. `t` is 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `x` is an integer greater than 0. If `x` was originally even, `x` is now `x // 2`, `max` is 99999997`, `min` is -100000000`, and `ans` is [100000000, 99999999, 99999997]. If `x` was originally odd, `x` remains unchanged, `max` is 99999999`, `min` is -99999999`, and `ans` is [100000000, 99999999, -99999999] if `x` was originally even, or [100000000, `min`, `min`] if `x` was originally odd. `t` is 3.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
