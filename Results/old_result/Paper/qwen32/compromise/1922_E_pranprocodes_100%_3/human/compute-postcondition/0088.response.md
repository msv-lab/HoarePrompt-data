The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`, which means `x` is divided by 2 and the floor of the result is taken. Given that `x` is an even number and not equal to 1, after this operation, `x` will still be an even number. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an even number not equal to 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [100000000], `t` is 0, `i` is 3**.
