The provided code snippet only modifies the value of `max`. The new value of `max` is set to `100000000`. The other variables (`x`, `min`, `ans`, `t`, and `i`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is the input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000 + t_o, `ans` is a list of `t` elements where each element is either `max` or `min` depending on whether `x` was even or odd in that iteration, but in reversed order, `t` is the total number of iterations, `i` is 3**.
