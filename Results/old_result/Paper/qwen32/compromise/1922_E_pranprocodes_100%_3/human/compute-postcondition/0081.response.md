The code snippet provided only changes the value of `min` to `-100000000`. The other variables (`x`, `max`, `ans`, `t`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is the input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list of `t` elements where each element is either `max` or `min` depending on whether `x` was even or odd in that iteration, but in reversed order, `t` is the total number of iterations, `i` is 3**.
