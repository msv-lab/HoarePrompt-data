The code appends the value of `min` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `min` is either -99999999 or -99999998 based on whether `x` is even or odd. The list `ans` initially contains two elements: [100000000, 99999999] if `x` is even, [100000000, -99999999] if `x` is odd, or [-100000000, -100000000] if `x` is 0. After appending `min`, the list `ans` will have three elements.

Output State: **`x` is an integer not equal to 1, `max` is 99999998 if `x` is even, `max` is 99999999 if `x` is odd, `min` is -99999999 if `x` is even, `min` is -99999998 if `x` is odd, `ans` is [100000000, 99999999, -99999999] if `x` is even, `ans` is [100000000, -99999999, -99999998] if `x` is odd, or `ans` is [-100000000, -100000000, -99999998] if `x` is 0, `t` is 2, `i` is 3**.
