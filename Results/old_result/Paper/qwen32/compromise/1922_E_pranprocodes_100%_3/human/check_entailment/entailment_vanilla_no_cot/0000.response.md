Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem of finding an array with exactly X increasing subsequences. The logic in the code does not ensure that the number of increasing subsequences in the generated array matches the given X. The approach seems to be attempting to construct the array based on the binary representation of X, but this does not directly translate to the number of increasing subsequences in the array. The problem requires a more careful construction of the array to ensure the exact count of increasing subsequences matches X.
