The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `X` (where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}). For each test case, it performs a series of operations to reduce `X` to 1, appending either a maximum or minimum value to a list based on whether `X` is even or odd, respectively. It then prints the number of operations performed and the list of appended values in reverse order.
