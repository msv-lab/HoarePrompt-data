Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues.

1. **Reversing the Lists:** The program reverses both the `lista_A` and `lista_B`. This is incorrect because the problem requires Kirill to bribe people in the order they are in the queue, not in reverse order.

2. **Logic for Bribery:** The logic for calculating the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend is flawed. The program incorrectly assumes that if `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, Kirill should bribe the person at position `i` and reset the accumulated `soma_b`. This does not account for the fact that Kirill might need to bribe multiple people to reach his desired position `m`.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:** The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case. However, since `func_1` is flawed, the overall program is incorrect.

### Example of Incorrectness:

Let's consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5 3
7 3 6 9 2
4 3 8 5 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
13
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Kirill can bribe the person at position 5 (cost 2) and then bribe the person at position 4 (cost 9), but he can also bribe the person at position 3 (cost 6) and then bribe the person at position 2 (cost 3). The minimum cost is 2 (to bribe position 5) + 3 (to bribe position 2) = 5. However, he also needs to pay the people in between, so the total cost is 5 (bribing position 5 and 2) + 1 (for person at position 4) = 6. The correct minimum cost is 13 (bribing position 5 and paying 9 for position 4, then bribing position 4 and paying 3 for position 3).

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The program will likely output an incorrect value due to the flawed logic.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the bribery logic and the order of the queue, leading to incorrect results for many test cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
