Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lista_A` is a list of integers of length `n` representing the cost `a_i` for each person in the queue, but in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of integers of length `n` read from the input, where each element in `lista_B` is a positive integer representing the cost `b_i` for each person in the queue, but now in the reversed order, `soma_b` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `soma_b` is initialized to 0. The values of `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, and `lista_B` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the provided code snippet.
