You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill, and k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n. lista_A and lista_B are lists of integers of length n, where each element in lista_A and lista_B is a positive integer representing the cost a_i and b_i respectively for each person in the queue.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_A.reverse()
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B.reverse()
    soma_b = 0
    pref = 0
    for i in range(n - k):
        if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:
            pref += soma_b
            pref += lista_A[i]
            soma_b = 0
        else:
            soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lista_A` is a list of integers of length `n` representing the cost `a_i` for each person in the queue, but in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of integers of length `n` representing the cost `b_i` for each person in the queue, but now in the reversed order, `soma_b` is the sum of `lista_B[i]` for all `i` where `lista_A[i] >= lista_B[i]` and no `lista_A[j] < lista_B[j]` has occurred after `i` that would reset `soma_b`, `pref` is the accumulated sum as described in the loop logic.
    resultado = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - k, n):
        resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
        
        soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lista_A` is a list of integers of length `n` representing the cost `a_i` for each person in the queue, but in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of integers of length `n` representing the cost `b_i` for each person in the queue, but now in the reversed order, `soma_b` is the sum of `lista_B[i]` for all `i` from `n - k` to `n - 1`, `pref` is the accumulated sum as described in the loop logic, `resultado` is the minimum value of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for all `i` from `n - k` to `n - 1`.
    print(resultado)
    #This is printed: resultado (where resultado is the minimum value of pref + soma_b + lista_A[i] for all i from n - k to n - 1)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill), `k` (a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n), `lista_A` (a list of integers of length n representing the cost a_i for each person in the queue), and `lista_B` (a list of integers of length n representing the cost b_i for each person in the queue). The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
