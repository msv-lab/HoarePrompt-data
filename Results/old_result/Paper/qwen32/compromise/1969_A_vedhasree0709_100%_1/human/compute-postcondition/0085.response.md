Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `i` is explicitly set to 1.
2. `j` is determined by the value of `q`. If `q` equals 2, `j` is set to 1; otherwise, `j` is set to 0.
3. `n` must be at least 2, but its exact value is not specified.
4. `l` is a new list of integers read from the input.
5. `p` is the element at index 1 of the list `l`.
6. `q` is the element at index `p - 1` of the list `l`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print(2)` is straightforward. It simply prints the integer `2` regardless of the values of the variables `i`, `j`, `n`, `l`, `p`, and `q`. The values of these variables do not influence the output of the print statement because the statement is hardcoded to print the number `2`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the number `2`.

Output: **2**
