The code snippet `i = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `i`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `l`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the integer value of the user's input; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 0 indicating that no `q` equals `i + 1` during any iteration.**
