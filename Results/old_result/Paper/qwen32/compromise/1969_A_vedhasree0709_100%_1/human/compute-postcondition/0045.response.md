Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is at least 1; `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `p` is the first element of the list `l`; `q` is the first element of the list `l` and `q` is 1; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `j`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
