Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `l` is a new list of integers read from the input, `p` is the element at index 1 of `l`, and `q` is the element at index `p - 1` of `l`.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `j` has been explicitly set to 1. The values of `i`, `n`, `l`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state.
