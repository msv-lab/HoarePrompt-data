Let's break down the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `i` is 2.
2. `j` is 1 if `q` equals 2, otherwise `j` is 0.
3. `n` must be at least 3.
4. `l` is a new list of integers read from the input.
5. `p` is the element at index 2 of `l`.
6. `q` is the element at index `p - 1` of `l`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that directly prints the integer `2`. The value `2` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement and does not depend on any of the variables (`i`, `j`, `n`, `l`, `p`, `q`) defined in the initial state.

### Output:
The `print(2)` statement will output the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
