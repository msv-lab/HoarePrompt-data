### Reasoning:

The provided program processes each test case as follows:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, and `k` and adjusts `f` and `k` to be zero-indexed.
3. It reads the list `a` of `n` integers.
4. It stores the value of the favorite cube `x = a[f]`.
5. It sorts the list `a` in non-increasing order.
6. It then checks the value at the `k`-th position in the sorted list:
   - If the `k`-th value is greater than `x`, it prints 'NO' because the favorite cube will not be removed.
   - If the `k`-th value is less than `x`, it prints 'YES' because the favorite cube will be removed.
   - If the `k`-th value is equal to `x`, it further checks:
     - If `k` is the last position (`k == n - 1`), it prints 'YES' because there are no more elements after `k`, so `x` will be removed.
     - If the next element (`a[k + 1]`) is less than `x`, it prints 'YES' because `x` will be removed.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE' because `x` could be at position `k` or after `k` in the sorted list, leading to either removal or retention.

The program correctly handles all cases as per the problem description and the provided execution summary. It properly accounts for the scenarios where the favorite cube could be removed, not removed, or possibly either removed or left.
