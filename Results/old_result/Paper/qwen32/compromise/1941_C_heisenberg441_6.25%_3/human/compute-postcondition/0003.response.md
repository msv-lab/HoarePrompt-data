The code snippet `ans = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `ans`. The other variables, `s` and `n`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6) and consists of lowercase Latin letters, and `s` is not equal to 'mapie'; `ans` is 0.**
