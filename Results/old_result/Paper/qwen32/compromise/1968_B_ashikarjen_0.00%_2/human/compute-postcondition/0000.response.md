Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a binary string of length n; `b` is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values across test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of all m values across test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

In simple terms, `n` and `m` have been assigned the values from the input, while `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
