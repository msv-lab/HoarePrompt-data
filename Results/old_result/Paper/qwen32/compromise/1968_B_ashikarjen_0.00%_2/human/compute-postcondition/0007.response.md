Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is the new binary string input; `b` is the new binary string input such that `b[0] != a[0]`; `k` is 0; `j` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `j` is incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their initial values.
