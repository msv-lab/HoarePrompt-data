Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a non-empty binary string input; `b` is a non-empty binary string input; `i` is 0; `j` is 1**

Natural Language: The value of `j` has been incremented by 1, making it equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
