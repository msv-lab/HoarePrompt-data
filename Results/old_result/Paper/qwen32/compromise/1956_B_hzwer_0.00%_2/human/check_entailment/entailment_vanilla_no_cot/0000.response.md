Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. The dynamic programming (DP) table `dp` is not being used correctly to reflect the optimal strategy for both players. The program does not account for the optimal moves of Nene, who always plays to maximize her score and minimize yours.

Here are some key issues:
- The DP table `dp[i][j]` should represent the maximum score you can achieve starting from the `i`-th turn with `j` pairs already on the table.
- The logic for updating the DP table is flawed. For example, the line `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])` incorrectly assumes that `dp[i + 1][j + 1]` is a valid state, which it is not.
- The program does not correctly handle the case where you or Nene play a card that has already been played, which should affect the score and the state of the table.

A correct solution would involve a more sophisticated approach to simulate the game, taking into account the optimal moves of both players. This might involve using a more detailed DP state or a different strategy altogether, such as a greedy approach or a game tree search with alpha-beta pruning.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.
