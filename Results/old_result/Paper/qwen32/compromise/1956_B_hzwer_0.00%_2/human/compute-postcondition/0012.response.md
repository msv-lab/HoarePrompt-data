Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 2, `cards` is a list of integers read from input, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is 0, and `dp[n - 2][0]` is 0. Additionally, `cards` contains at least one occurrence of `j + 1`. The count of `j + 1` in `cards` is more than 1.**
