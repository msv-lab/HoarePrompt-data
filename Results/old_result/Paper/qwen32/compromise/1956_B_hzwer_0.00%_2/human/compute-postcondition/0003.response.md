The code sets the value of `dp[n - 1][0]` to 0. All other elements and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `cards` is a list of integers read from input, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is 0.**
