The given code snippet assigns the value of `dp[i + 1][j]` to `dp[i][j]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. The count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is 0, but this detail does not affect the assignment directly.

The assignment changes the value of `dp[i][j]` to be equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. Since `i` is 0, this means `dp[0][j]` is now equal to `dp[1][j]`.

Output State: **`dp` table with `dp[0][j]` holding the value of `dp[1][j]`, `dp[0][0]` holding the maximum number of cards that can be collected, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is 0.**
