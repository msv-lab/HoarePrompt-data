Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` representing the number of cards, and a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive and appears at most twice. The function returns the maximum number of cards that can be collected starting from the beginning of the `cards` list, which is stored in `dp[0][0]`.**
