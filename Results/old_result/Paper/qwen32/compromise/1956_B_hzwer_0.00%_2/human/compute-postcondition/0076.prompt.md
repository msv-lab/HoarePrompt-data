Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `dp[0][j]` holds the maximum number of cards that can be collected starting from position `j` in the `cards` list, considering the constraints given in the loop. Specifically, for each `j` from `n-1` down to `0`, `dp[0][j]` is updated based on whether the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is 0, 1, or greater than 1. `dp[0][0]` will hold the maximum number of cards that can be collected starting from the beginning of the list. `i` is `n - 4`
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
        dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
    elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
    else:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `dp[0][j]` holds the maximum number of cards that can be collected starting from position `j` in the `cards` list. If the `cards` list does not contain `j + 1`, `dp[0][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If the `cards` list contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, `dp[0][j]` is the maximum value between `dp[1][j]` and `dp[2][j - 1] + 1`. If the `cards` list contains more than one occurrence of `j + 1`, `dp[0][j]` is the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. `n` is at least 1, and `j` is `n - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `dp[0][j]` holds the maximum number of cards that can be collected starting from position `j` in the `cards` list. If the `cards` list does not contain `j + 1`, `dp[0][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If the `cards` list contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, `dp[0][j]` is the maximum value between `dp[1][j]` and `dp[2][j - 1] + 1`. If the `cards` list contains more than one occurrence of `j + 1`, `dp[0][j]` is the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. `n` is at least 1, and `j` is `1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `dp[0][j]` holds the maximum number of cards that can be collected starting from position `j` in the `cards` list. If the `cards` list does not contain `j + 1`, `dp[0][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If the `cards` list contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, `dp[0][j]` is the maximum value between `dp[1][j]` and `dp[2][j - 1] + 1`. If the `cards` list contains more than one occurrence of `j + 1`, `dp[0][j]` is the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. `n` is at least 1, and `j` is `0`. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 0`, then `dp[0][0]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][0]`. Otherwise, the value of `dp[0][0]` is determined based on the number of occurrences of `j + 1` in the `cards` list as described.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
