The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each of these components to an integer, and then stores them in a list named `cards`. The variable `n`, which represents the number of cards, is not modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, representing the number of cards you and Nene each receive, and `cards` is a list of integers read from input.**
