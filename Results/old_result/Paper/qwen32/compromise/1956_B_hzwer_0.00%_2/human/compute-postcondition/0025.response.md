Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `cards` is a list of integers read from input, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, `j` is 1, `dp[i][j]` is `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])`**

In this output state, the value of `dp[i][j]` has been updated to be the maximum of three values: `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. The other variables (`n`, `cards`, `j`) remain unchanged.
