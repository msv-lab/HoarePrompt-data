Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 2, `cards` is a list of integers read from input, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. If `cards` does not contain the integer `j + 1`, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `cards` contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. All other elements of `dp` remain unchanged.**
