### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether a given subarray of an array `c` is "good" based on the criteria specified. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic used in the program and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the cumulative sum of the array `c` and stores it in the list `p`. This allows for efficient computation of the sum of any subarray `c[l:r+1]` using the formula `p[r] - p[l-1]`.

2. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program calculates the sum of the subarray `c[l:r+1]` using the precomputed cumulative sums.
   - It then checks if the subarray can be considered "good". According to the problem, a subarray is "good" if:
     - Its length is greater than 1 (`b - a + 1 > 1`).
     - The sum of the subarray (`s`) is at least twice its length (`s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`).

3. **Explanation of the Condition**:
   - If the length of the subarray is greater than 1, we need to check if we can construct an array `b` such that:
     - The sum of `b` is equal to the sum of the subarray.
     - No element in `b` is equal to the corresponding element in the subarray.
     - All elements in `b` are positive.
   - The condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` ensures that there is enough "slack" in the sum to allow each element in `b` to be different from the corresponding element in the subarray while still being positive. For example, if the subarray has a sum of 6 and length 3, we need to ensure that `b` can be something like `[2, 2, 2]` (which is not allowed because elements must be different), so the smallest possible `b` could be `[1, 2, 3]` or `[3, 2, 1]` etc., which requires a sum of at least 6 (which is exactly the sum of the subarray in this case).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles subarrays of length 1 by immediately returning "NO" since a single-element subarray cannot satisfy the condition of having a different array `b` with the same sum.
   - The program also correctly handles larger subarrays by ensuring that the sum condition is met.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the problem's criteria. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:
