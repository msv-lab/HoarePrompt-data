The code snippet `s -= p[a - 2]` modifies the value of `s` by subtracting `p[a - 2]` from it. 

Given that `s` was initially set to `p[b - 1]`, the new value of `s` will be `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:
- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` remains the first integer obtained from the input.
- `m` remains the second integer obtained from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `l` remains a list of integers obtained from the new input.
- `p` remains a list containing the cumulative sums after each element of `l` has been added.
- `c` remains the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `_` remains 2.
- `a` and `b` remain the two integers obtained from the latest input.
- `s` is now `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer obtained from the input; `m` is the second integer obtained from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums after each element of `l` has been added; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `_` is 2; `a` and `b` are the two integers obtained from the latest input; `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.**
