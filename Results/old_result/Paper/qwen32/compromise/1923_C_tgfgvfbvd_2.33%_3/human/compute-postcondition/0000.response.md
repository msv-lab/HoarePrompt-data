In the given task, the for loop iterates over the number of test cases, which is determined by the integer `t`. The loop head only involves the variable `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't intend to use within the loop body.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to make sure that `t` is at least 1 because the loop will run `t` times. The other variables (`n`, `q`, `c`, `l_i`, `r_i`) are defined inside the loop and do not affect whether the loop itself will execute or not. Therefore, we only need to adjust the state of `t`.

Given that `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. Since this condition is already met by the problem constraints, no further adjustment is needed for `t` itself. However, to clearly specify the state before the loop starts, we can state that `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**

This state ensures that the loop will execute at least once.
