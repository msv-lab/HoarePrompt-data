The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `l`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
