The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`, which iterates over the list `l`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `x` for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` took the value of the current element in the list `l`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` should take the value of the next element in the list `l`.

Since the loop iterates over each element in `l`, the state of `x` at the start of the next iteration would be the next element in the list `l`.

However, we don't have specific information about the current position of `x` in the list `l` or the elements of `l`. We only know that `l` contains at least one element.

Given this, we can assume that `x` has just taken the value of the current element, and for the loop to continue, `x` should take the value of the subsequent element in the list `l`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer obtained from the input; `m` is the second integer obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must contain at least one element; `p` is a list containing the value of `c`; `c` is `c + x`; `_` is 1; `x` is the next element in the list `l`**
