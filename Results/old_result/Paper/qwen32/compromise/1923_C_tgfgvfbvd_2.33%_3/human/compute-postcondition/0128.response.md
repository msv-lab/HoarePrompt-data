Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer obtained from the input; `m` is the second integer obtained from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums after each element of `l` has been added; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `_` is `m`; `a` and `b` are the two integers obtained from the latest input. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains `p[b - 1]`. The condition `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` is checked for each iteration, and 'YES' or 'NO' is printed accordingly.**

In simpler terms, after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the loop counter `_` will have reached the value of `m`, which is the total number of iterations specified. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, and `c` remain unchanged as they were not modified within the loop. For each iteration, the values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the latest input, and the condition `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` is evaluated to print either 'YES' or 'NO'.
