The value of `c` is incremented by `x`. Given that `c` was initially `1 + x`, after the operation `c += x`, the new value of `c` becomes `(1 + x) + x`, which simplifies to `1 + 2*x`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input where `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element, `p` is a list containing the integers `[1, 1 + x]`, `c` is `1 + 2*x`, `_` is 1, `x` is the next element in the list `l`**.
