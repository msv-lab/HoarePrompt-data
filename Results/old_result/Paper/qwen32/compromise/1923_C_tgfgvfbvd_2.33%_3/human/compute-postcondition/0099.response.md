The given code snippet appends the current value of `c` to the list `p`. Since `c` is already updated to `c + x` before this line, the new value of `c` (which is `c + x`) is appended to `p`.

Here's the breakdown of the changes:
- `p` originally contains `[c, c + x + x]`.
- After appending `c` (which is now `c + x`), `p` becomes `[c, c + x + x, c + x]`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer obtained from the input; `m` is the second integer obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must contain at least one element; `p` is a list containing the values `[c, c + x + x, c + x]`; `c` is `c + x`; `_` is 1; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
