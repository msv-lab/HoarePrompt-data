Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`: An integer obtained from the input.
- `m`: An integer greater than 0.
- `l`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
- `p`: A list containing the cumulative sums starting from 1.
- `c`: The total sum of all elements in `l` plus 1.
- `_`: The value 2.
- `a` and `b`: Integers obtained from the input.
- `s`: Calculated based on the condition `if a - 2 >= 0`, then `s = p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`; otherwise, `s = p[b - 1]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`. This string does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. Therefore, the output will always be `'NO'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, or `s`.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
