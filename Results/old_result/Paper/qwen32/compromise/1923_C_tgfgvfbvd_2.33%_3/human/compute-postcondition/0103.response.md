The code snippet assigns the value of `p[b - 1]` to the variable `s`. Given the initial state, `p` is a list containing cumulative sums after each element of `l` has been added, and `b` is an integer obtained from the latest input.

Therefore, `s` will take the value of the element at index `b - 1` in the list `p`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer obtained from the input; `m` is the second integer obtained from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums after each element of `l` has been added; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `_` is 1; `a` and `b` are the two integers obtained from the latest input; `s` is `p[b - 1]`.**
