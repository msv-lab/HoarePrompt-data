Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is an empty list; `c` is 0; `_` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `c` was originally the sum of all elements in the list `l`. After executing `c = 0`, the value of `c` is now 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
