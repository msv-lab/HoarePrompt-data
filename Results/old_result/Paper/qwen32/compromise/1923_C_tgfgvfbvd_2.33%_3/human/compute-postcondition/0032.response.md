Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's analyze what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `m` are integers with `m > 0`.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `a` and `b` are integers.
- If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`; otherwise, `s` is `p[b - 1]`.
- Either `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, or `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s < 2 * (b - a + 1)`.
- `_` is decremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('NO')` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of any variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. The presence of the conditions and calculations in the initial state does not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
