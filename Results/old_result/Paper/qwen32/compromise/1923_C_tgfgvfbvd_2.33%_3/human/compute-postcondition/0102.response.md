The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state includes several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `_`), but only `a` and `b` are modified by the provided code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer obtained from the input; `m` is the second integer obtained from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums after each element of `l` has been added; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `_` is 1; `a` and `b` are the two integers obtained from the latest input.**
