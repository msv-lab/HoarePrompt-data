The code snippet `c += x` increments the value of `c` by the value of `x`. Given the initial state, `c` is initially `c + x`, and `x` is the next element in the list `l`. After executing `c += x`, `c` will be updated to its current value plus `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer obtained from the input; `m` is the second integer obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must contain at least one element; `p` is a list containing the value of `c`; `c` is `c + x + x`; `_` is 1; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**

In natural language: The value of `c` is now `c + x + x`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
