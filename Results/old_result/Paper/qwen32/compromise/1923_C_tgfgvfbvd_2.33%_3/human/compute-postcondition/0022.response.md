The initial state provides several variables and conditions but does not directly influence the content of the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Here's the breakdown of the relevant information:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `n` and `m` are integers with `m` being greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `p` is a list of cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `a` and `b` are integers.
- `s` is calculated based on the values of `a` and `b` and the cumulative sums in `p`.

Despite these details about the variables, the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of these variables. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
