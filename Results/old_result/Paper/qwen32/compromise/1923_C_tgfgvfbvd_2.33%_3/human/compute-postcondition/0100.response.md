To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's analyze the loop's behavior:

- The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `l`.
- For each iteration, it adds the current element `x` to the cumulative sum `c`.
- It then appends the updated value of `c` to the list `p`.

Given the initial state and the descriptions of the states after the first three iterations, we can generalize the final state as follows:

- `t` remains unchanged since it is not modified within the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged since it is not modified within the loop.
- `m` remains unchanged since it is not modified within the loop.
- `l` remains unchanged since the loop only reads from it.
- `p` will contain the cumulative sums after each iteration.
- `c` will be the sum of all elements in `l` after the loop completes.
- `_` remains unchanged since it is not modified within the loop.

Let's denote the length of the list `l` as `len(l)`. After `len(l)` iterations, the list `p` will contain `len(l)` elements, where each element is the cumulative sum up to that point in the list `l`.

Thus, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer obtained from the input; `m` is the second integer obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums after each element of `l` has been added; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `_` is 1.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `p` will have the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` will be the total sum of all elements in `l`, and all other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `_`) will remain unchanged.
