The value of `c` is incremented by the value of `x`. Since `x` is the next element in the list `l`, and `c` was initially 1, `c` now equals `1 + x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input where `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element, `p` is a list containing the integer 1, `c` is `1 + x`, `_` is 1, `x` is the next element in the list `l`**.
