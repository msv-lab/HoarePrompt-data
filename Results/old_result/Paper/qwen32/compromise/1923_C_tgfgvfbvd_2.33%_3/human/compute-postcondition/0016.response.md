The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, or `c`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input.**
