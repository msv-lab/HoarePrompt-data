The given Python code snippet updates the values of `a` and `b` by reading two integers from the input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from the input, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums starting from 1, `c` is the total sum of all elements in `l` plus 1, `_` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input, `s` is calculated based on the values of `a` and `b` and the list `p`. `a` and `b` have been updated to the new values obtained from the input.**
