The code snippet `p.append(c)` appends the value of `c` to the list `p`. Given that `c` is initially 1, the list `p` which was previously empty now contains the single element 1.

All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `_`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input where `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element, `p` is a list containing the integer 1, `c` is 1, `_` is 1**.
