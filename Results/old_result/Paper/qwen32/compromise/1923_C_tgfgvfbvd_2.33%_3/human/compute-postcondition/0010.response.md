The code appends the value of `c` to the list `p`. Given that `p` initially contains only the element `c`, after appending `c` again, `p` will contain two elements, both of which are `c`.

The value of `c` is defined as `c + 2*x`, where `x` is the next element in the list `l`. This means `c` has already been updated before the append operation.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `p` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `c`; `c` is `c + 2*x`; `x` is the next element in the list `l`.**
