The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and `q`, a list `c` of `n` positive integers, and `q` queries. Each query consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i`. The function calculates the sum of the elements in the list `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive) and prints 'YES' if the sum is at least twice the number of elements in the queried range and the range contains more than one element; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
