The code snippet initializes a variable `beautiful_count` to 0. No other variables are modified. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, `test_cases` is a list of test cases, `results` is an empty list, and `freq` is also an empty dictionary. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` are derived from elements of a test case but are not altered in this snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a) with 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']`, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0.**
