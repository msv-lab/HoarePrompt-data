Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary where the count of `(mod_x, mod_y)` is either reset to 0 or remains unchanged, `num` is the next element in the list `a` after the previously processed element, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, and `beautiful_count` is unchanged if `(mod_x, mod_y)` is in `freq`; otherwise, `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is reset to 0.**
