The given code snippet calculates `mod_y` which is `num % y`. This means that `mod_y` will now hold the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `mod_y`. All other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary with the count of `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - (y % x)) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `x % y`, `num` is the next element in `a`**. 

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4, `test_cases` retains its list of test cases, `results` remains an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` retain their values from `case['params']`, `a` retains its array from `case['array']`, `freq` retains its dictionary counts, `mod_x` remains `num % x`, `mod_y` is now `num % y`, `required_mod_x` remains `(x - (y % x)) % x`, `required_mod_y` remains `x % y`, and `num` remains the next element in `a`.
