You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three integers n, x, and y where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and a list a of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, x, y = case['params']
        
        a = case['array']
        
        freq = {}
        
        beautiful_count = 0
        
        print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
        
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
            required_mod_y = mod_y
            print(
                f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
                )
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
            if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
                freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
        
        print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
        
        results.append(beautiful_count)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from all processed test cases, `case` is the last test case in `test_cases`, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is `case['array']`, `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair encountered during the last iteration of the loop, `beautiful_count` is the total count of "beautiful" pairs found during the last iteration of the loop. All test cases have been processed and their respective `beautiful_count` values have been appended to `results`.
    return results
    #The program returns `results`, which is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from all processed test cases. Each `beautiful_count` represents the total count of "beautiful" pairs found during the processing of each test case in `test_cases`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case consists of three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function processes each test case to determine the number of "beautiful" pairs and returns a list `results` containing the count of such pairs for each test case.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `results`, which is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from all processed test cases. Each `beautiful_count` represents the total count of "beautiful" pairs found during the processing of each test case in `test_cases`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
