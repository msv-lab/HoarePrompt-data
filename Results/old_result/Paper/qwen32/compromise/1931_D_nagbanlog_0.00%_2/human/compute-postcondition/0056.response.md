To determine what will be printed, let's break down the variables and their values based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. However, `t` is not used in the print statement, so we don't need to consider it further.
- `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a).
- `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case.
- `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`. This means `case` is a tuple (n, x, y, a).
- `n` is the first element of `case['params']`. Since `case` is a tuple, this should be corrected to `case[0]`.
- `x` is the second element of `case['params']`. Similarly, this should be corrected to `case[1]`.
- `y` is the third element of `case['params']`. This should be corrected to `case[2]`.
- `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element. This should be corrected to `case[3]`.
- `freq` is an empty dictionary.
- `beautiful_count` is 0.
- `mod_x` is `n % x`.
- `mod_y` is `n % y`.
- `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(
    f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
)
```
There seems to be a variable `num` mentioned in the print statement which is not defined in the initial state. Assuming `num` is supposed to be `n`, we can proceed with the explanation.

Let's summarize the values:
- `num` (assuming it's `n`) is the first element of the current test case tuple, i.e., `case[0]`.
- `mod_x` is `n % x`.
- `mod_y` is `n % y`.
- `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **Number: [n], mod_x: [n % x], mod_y: [n % y], required_mod_x: [(x - (n % x)) % x], required_mod_y: [n % y] (where n is the first element of the current test case tuple, x is the second element, and y is the third element)**

If we assume `case` is a specific tuple, for example, `(10, 3, 5, [1, 2, 3])`, then:
- `num` (or `n`) = 10
- `x` = 3
- `y` = 5
- `mod_x` = 10 % 3 = 1
- `mod_y` = 10 % 5 = 0
- `required_mod_x` = (3 - 1) % 3 = 2
- `required_mod_y` = 0

So the output would be:
Output: **Number: 10, mod_x: 1, mod_y: 0, required_mod_x: 2, required_mod_y: 0**

However, since the exact `case` tuple is not provided, the general form of the output is:
Output: **Number: [n], mod_x: [n % x], mod_y: [n % y], required_mod_x: [(x - (n % x)) % x], required_mod_y: [n % y] (where n is the first element of the current test case tuple, x is the second element, and y is the third element)**
