The code snippet provided calculates the modulus of `num` with `x` and assigns it to `mod_x`. However, there is no variable named `num` defined in the initial state. Given the context, it seems like `num` should be `n` from the `case['params']`.

Given that `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, the correct operation would be:

```python
mod_x = n % x
```

Thus, `mod_x` will be the remainder when `n` is divided by `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x` is `n % x`.**
