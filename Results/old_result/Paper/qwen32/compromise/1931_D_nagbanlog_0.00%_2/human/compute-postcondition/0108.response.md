The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has more elements, the loop will execute again for the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the last element processed from the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `a` to process. Therefore, `num` should be set to the next element in the list `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case and the newly appended `beautiful_count`, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `mod_x` is `n % x`, `mod_y` is `n % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `n % y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `num` is the next element in `a`**
