The given code snippet updates the value of `mod_y` by calculating the modulus of `num` with `y`. No other variables are modified in this snippet.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `mod_y` is recalculated to be `num % y`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case and the newly appended `beautiful_count`, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `n % y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `num` is the next element in `a`**.

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4, `test_cases` retains its list of test cases, `results` keeps its list of `beautiful_count` values, `case` remains the current test case, `n`, `x`, and `y` retain their respective values from `case['params']`, `a` retains its array of elements, `mod_x` remains `num % x`, `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`, `required_mod_x` remains `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` remains `n % y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` retains its incremented count, and `num` remains the next element in `a`.
