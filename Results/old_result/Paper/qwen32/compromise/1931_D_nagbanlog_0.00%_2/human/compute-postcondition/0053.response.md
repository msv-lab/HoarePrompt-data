The given code snippet attempts to assign a value to `mod_y` using the expression `num % y`. However, there is no variable named `num` defined in the initial state. It seems like there might be a typo or missing context, as `num` should likely be `n` based on the pattern of variable usage.

Assuming the intention was to compute `mod_y` as `n % y`, here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x` is `n % x`, `mod_y` is `n % y`.**

In natural language: The variable `mod_y` is now assigned the value of `n % y`. All other variables retain their previously described states.
