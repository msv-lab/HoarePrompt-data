The code calculates the modulus of `num` with `x` and assigns it to `mod_x`. No other variables are affected.

Given the initial state, `num` is the next element in `a`, and `x` is `case['params'][1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case and the newly appended `beautiful_count`, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `num` is the next element in `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`.**
