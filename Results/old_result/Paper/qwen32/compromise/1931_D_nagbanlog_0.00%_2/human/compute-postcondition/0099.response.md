The code snippet assigns the value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. None of the other variables are modified by this assignment.

Given the initial state, `mod_y` is calculated as `n % y`. Therefore, after executing the line `required_mod_y = mod_y`, the variable `required_mod_y` will have the same value as `mod_y`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case and the newly appended `beautiful_count`, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x` is `n % x`, `mod_y` is `n % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `n % y`.**
