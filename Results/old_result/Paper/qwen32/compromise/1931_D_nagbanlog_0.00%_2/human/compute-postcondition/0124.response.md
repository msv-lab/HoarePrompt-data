To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (This is the number of test cases).
- `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case.
- `results` is a list that contains the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case and the newly appended `beautiful_count`.
- `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`.
- `n` is `case['params'][0]` (the first parameter of the current test case).
- `x` is `case['params'][1]` (the second parameter of the current test case).
- `y` is `case['params'][2]` (the third parameter of the current test case).
- `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element (the array associated with the current test case).
- `num` is the next element in `a`.
- `mod_x` is `num % x` (the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`).
- `mod_y` is `num % y` (the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`).
- `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x` (the additional amount needed to make `num` divisible by `x`).
- `required_mod_y` is `mod_y` (the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`).

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(
    f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
)
```

### Values to be Printed:
- **Number**: This is the current element `num` from the array `a`.
- **mod_x**: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
- **mod_y**: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
- **required_mod_x**: This is the additional amount needed to make `num` divisible by `x`. It is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- **required_mod_y**: This is the same as `mod_y`.

### Output Description:
Given the above breakdown, the output will be a formatted string showing the current number, its remainders when divided by `x` and `y`, the additional amount needed to make it divisible by `x`, and the remainder when divided by `y`.

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [num % x], mod_y: [num % y], required_mod_x: [(x - (num % x)) % x], required_mod_y: [num % y] (where num is the current element from the array a, x and y are parameters from the current test case)**
