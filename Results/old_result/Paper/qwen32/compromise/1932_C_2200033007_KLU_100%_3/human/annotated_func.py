#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and s is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: The list `b` will contain all elements of `a` but in a new order determined by the string `s`. The indices `l` and `r` will be `n` and `-1` respectively, as `l` will have been incremented `n` times and `r` decremented `n` times, assuming all 'L's and 'R's are used to their full extent. The variables `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged.
    #
    #Output State:
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: `ans` is `[p1, p2, ..., pn]` where each `pi` is the cumulative product modulo `m` of the elements of `b` in reverse order.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the list [pn, ..., p2, p1] where each pi is the cumulative product modulo m of the elements of b in reverse order, but now the list is in the opposite order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes an integer `n`, an integer `m`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'. It rearranges the elements of `a` based on the instructions in `s`, computes the cumulative product modulo `m` of the rearranged list in reverse order, and returns the resulting list in reverse order.
