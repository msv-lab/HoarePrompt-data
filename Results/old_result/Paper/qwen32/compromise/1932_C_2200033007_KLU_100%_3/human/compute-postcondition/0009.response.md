Output State: **The program returns the list [pn, ..., p2, p1] where each pi is the cumulative product modulo m of the elements of b in reverse order, but now the list is in the opposite order.**

In simpler terms, the program returns the list `ans` reversed, so what was originally the last element of `ans` becomes the first, the second last becomes the second, and so on.
