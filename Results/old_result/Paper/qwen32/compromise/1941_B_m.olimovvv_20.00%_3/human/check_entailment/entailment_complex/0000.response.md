### Reasoning:
The provided code snippet does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if Rudolf can make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation. The conditions checked in the code do not ensure that the array can be transformed to all zeros. Let's analyze why the given logic is incorrect.

The operation allows Rudolf to choose an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n - 1 \)) and perform the following:
- Decrease \( a_{i-1} \) by 1.
- Decrease \( a_i \) by 2.
- Decrease \( a_{i+1} \) by 1.

The key point is that this operation affects three consecutive elements, and we need to ensure that all elements can be reduced to zero through a series of such operations.

The provided code only checks the parity of the first and last elements and their immediate neighbors, which is not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be reduced to zero. For example, consider the array `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`. The code would incorrectly return 'NO' because the first element is odd and the second element is not exactly two more than the first element.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the sum of the array is even (since each operation reduces the sum by 4) and that the elements can be reduced to zero through a series of valid operations. A more comprehensive approach is needed, but the provided code does not implement this.
