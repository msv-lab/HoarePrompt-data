To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables `size` and `value` based on the condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, we can infer the following:
- `size` starts at `max(sequence, default=0)` and is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- `value` is recalculated as `(1 << size) - (1 << i)` in each iteration.
- The loop continues to run as long as the condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number` is true.

From the provided output states after the first 3 iterations, we can see the pattern:
- After 1 iteration: `size` is `max(sequence, default=0) + 1`, `value` is \(\frac{7 \cdot 2^{max(sequence, default=0)}}{4}\).
- After 2 iterations: `size` is `max(sequence, default=0) + 2`, `value` is \(2^{size} - 2^{i}\).
- After 3 iterations: `size` is `max(sequence, default=0) + 3`, `value` is \(2^{size} - 2^{i}\).

The loop will continue to increment `size` and update `value` until the condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) > number` is met.

Let's denote the initial `size` as `s = max(sequence, default=0)`. The loop will run until:
\[ (1 << (s + k + 1)) - (1 << i) > number \]
where `k` is the number of iterations.

The final `size` will be `s + k` where `k` is the number of iterations the loop runs. The final `value` will be:
\[ value = (1 << (s + k)) - (1 << i) \]

The loop will stop when:
\[ (1 << (s + k + 1)) - (1 << i) > number \]
\[ (1 << (s + k + 1)) > number + (1 << i) \]
\[ s + k + 1 > \log_2(number + (1 << i)) \]
\[ k + 1 > \log_2(number + (1 << i)) - s \]
\[ k > \log_2(number + (1 << i)) - s - 1 \]
\[ k = \lceil \log_2(number + (1 << i)) - s - 1 \rceil \]

Therefore, the final `size` will be:
\[ size = s + \lceil \log_2(number + (1 << i)) - s - 1 \rceil \]
\[ size = \lceil \log_2(number + (1 << i)) - 1 \rceil \]

And the final `value` will be:
\[ value = (1 << size) - (1 << i) \]

Given the constraints and the nature of the loop, the final `size` and `value` can be calculated as described. Let's express this in the required format:

Output State: **`size` is \(\lceil \log_2(number + (1 << i)) - 1 \rceil\), `value` is \(2^{\lceil \log_2(number + (1 << i)) - 1 \rceil} - (1 << i)\)**.

In natural language, the final output state is that `size` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(\log_2(number + (1 << i)) - 1\), and `value` is \(2^{\text{size}} - (1 << i)\).
