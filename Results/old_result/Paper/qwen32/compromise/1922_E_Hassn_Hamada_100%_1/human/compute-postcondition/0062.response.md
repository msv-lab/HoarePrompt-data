The provided code snippet calls a function `func_1` with arguments that are calculated based on the initial state variables. The calculation for the first argument is `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)`. However, the variable `number` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot directly compute the value of the first argument. The `sequence` variable is passed as the second argument without any changes.

Given the information, we can update the state to reflect that `func_1` has been called with the specified arguments, but we cannot determine the internal state changes or return values of `func_1` since it is not defined in the provided context.

Output State: **`size` is 6, `overlap` is 1, `sequence` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], `func_1` is called with arguments `number - (1 << 6) + (1 << 1)` and `sequence`**.
