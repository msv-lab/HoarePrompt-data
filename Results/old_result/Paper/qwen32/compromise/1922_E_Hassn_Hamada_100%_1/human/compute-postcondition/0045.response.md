To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition:

```
while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:
```

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `size` is 3
- `value` is 6 (though `value` is not part of the loop condition, it's provided in the state)
- `number` must be at least 6

Let's evaluate the loop condition with the current state:

1. Calculate `1 << size + 1`:
   - `size + 1` is `3 + 1` which is `4`.
   - `1 << 4` is `16`.

2. Calculate `1 << i`:
   - `i` is `1`.
   - `1 << 1` is `2`.

3. Calculate `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)`:
   - `16 - 2` is `14`.

4. Evaluate the condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`:
   - `14 <= number` must be true for the loop to execute again.

Given that `number` must be at least 6, we need to adjust `number` to ensure that the condition `14 <= number` holds true. Therefore, `number` must be at least 14.

No other variables in the loop condition (`size` and `i`) need to be adjusted because changing them could potentially lead to a different loop condition that we cannot determine without more information.

So, the adjusted state is:
State: **`i` is 1, `size` is 3, `value` is 6, and `number` must be at least 14**.
