Output State: **`i` is 1, `size` is 4, `value` is 14, and `number` must be at least 14.**

Explanation: The value of `value` is recalculated based on the given expression `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`. With `size` being 4 and `i` being 1, the expression evaluates to `(1 << 4) - (1 << 1)`, which is `16 - 2`, resulting in `14`. The other variables remain unchanged.
