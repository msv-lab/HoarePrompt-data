The code snippet updates the value of the variable `value` using the expression `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`. Given the initial state, `size` is defined as `i + 2`, and `value` is initially `2`.

Let's break it down:
1. `1 << size` shifts the number `1` to the left by `size` positions, which is equivalent to `2 ** size`.
2. `1 << i` shifts the number `1` to the left by `i` positions, which is equivalent to `2 ** i`.
3. The expression `(1 << size) - (1 << i)` calculates `2 ** size - 2 ** i`.

Since `size` is `i + 2`, the expression becomes `2 ** (i + 2) - 2 ** i`.

The values of `number`, `sequence`, and `size_overlap` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`number` is an integer such that 3 <= number <= 1000, `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one integer where each integer X in `sequence` satisfies 2 <= X <= 10^18, `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `size` is `i + 2`, `value` is `2 ** (i + 2) - 2 ** i`**.
