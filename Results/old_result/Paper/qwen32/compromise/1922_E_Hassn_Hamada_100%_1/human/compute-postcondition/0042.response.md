To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop:

```
while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The condition involves the variables `size`, `i`, and `number`. At the end of the previous iteration:

- `i` is 1
- `size` is 2
- `value` is 2 (though `value` is not used in the loop condition, so it can be ignored for this purpose)
- `number` must be at least 3

Let's evaluate the expression `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)` with the given values:

- `1 << size + 1` is equivalent to `1 << (2 + 1)`, which is `1 << 3` or `8`.
- `1 << i` is equivalent to `1 << 1`, which is `2`.
- Therefore, `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)` is `8 - 2` or `6`.

The loop condition is `6 <= number`. Since `number` must be at least 3, the condition `6 <= number` will be true if `number` is 6 or greater.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `number` must be at least 6. The values of `i` and `size` do not need to be adjusted because they satisfy the condition as it stands.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `number` is at least 6.

State: **`i` is 1, `size` is 2, `value` is 2, and `number` must be at least 6**
