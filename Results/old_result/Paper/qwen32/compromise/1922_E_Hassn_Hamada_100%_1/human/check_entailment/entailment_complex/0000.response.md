Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` is supposed to generate an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. However, the function does not correctly implement the logic needed to achieve this goal. Here are the specific issues:

1. **Incorrect Function Logic**: The function `func_1` does not properly calculate the required elements to form an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The logic involving the calculation of `size` and `overlap` does not align with the problem requirements.

2. **Return Statement**: The function `func_1` returns `(0, 0)` regardless of the input, which is not useful for generating the required array.

3. **Appending Elements**: The logic for appending elements to the `sequence` list is incorrect and does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

4. **Recursive Call**: The recursive call `func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)` does not correctly reduce the problem size or ensure that the base case is reached properly.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where `X` is a power of 2 or other specific values correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly generate the required array for the given problem constraints.

Correctness: **False**
