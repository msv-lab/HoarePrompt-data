Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
The task is to find an array of integers such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences. If no such array exists, output -1. Otherwise, output the length of the array and the array itself.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (which is actually `X` as per the problem statement).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to generate a sequence of numbers that results in exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - The function uses a recursive approach to build the sequence.
   - It calculates the size and value of the sequence based on the binary representation of `X - 1`.
   - The function appends elements to the `sequence` list based on the calculated size and overlap.

3. **Output**:
   - After generating the sequence, the program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with `n - 1` as the argument, which seems incorrect. The function is supposed to generate a sequence for `X` increasing subsequences, not `X - 1`.

2. **Incorrect Base Case**:
   - The base case of the function `func_1` returns `(0, 0)` when `number == 0`. However, the function is supposed to modify the `sequence` list, not return a tuple.

3. **Logic for Sequence Generation**:
   - The logic inside the function `func_1` seems to be based on generating binary representations and calculating the size of the sequence. However, this logic does not directly ensure that the generated sequence has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where it's impossible to find such an array. It should output `-1` in such cases.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues outlined above, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for generating the sequence and ensuring the correct number of increasing subsequences is flawed, and the program does not handle all edge cases properly.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
