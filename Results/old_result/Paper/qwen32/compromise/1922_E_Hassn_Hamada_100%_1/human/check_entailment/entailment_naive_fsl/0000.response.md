Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the generation of arrays that result in exactly X increasing subsequences. Specifically, the program does not correctly implement the recursive function `func_1` to generate the required sequence. The function `func_1` is supposed to generate a sequence based on the number of increasing subsequences, but it does not correctly ensure that the resulting sequence has exactly X increasing subsequences for all possible values of X within the given range (2 ≤ X ≤ 10¹⁸).

Let's consider a specific example to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5
```

**Expected Output:**
An array of length at most 200 that has exactly 5 increasing subsequences. One possible output is:
```
3
0 1 0
```
This array has the following increasing subsequences: `[], [0], [1], [0, 1], [0, 0]`, which totals 5 subsequences.

**Actual Output:**
The provided program does not generate a correct sequence for this input. The function `func_1` does not correctly compute the sequence, leading to incorrect results.

To ensure correctness, the program must correctly implement the logic to generate the sequence such that the number of increasing subsequences matches the given X. The current implementation does not handle this correctly for all values of X, especially for larger values.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
