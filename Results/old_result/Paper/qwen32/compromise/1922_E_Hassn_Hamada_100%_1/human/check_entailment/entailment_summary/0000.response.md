Reasoning:  
The provided program and its execution summary do not align with the problem description. The program is supposed to generate an array of integers such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, but the execution summary does not reflect this behavior. The function `func_1` is supposed to modify the `sequence` list based on the value of `number`, but the summary suggests that it always returns the tuple (0, 0) regardless of the input, which is not consistent with the intended functionality. Moreover, the function's behavior as described in the summary does not help in constructing the required array for the given number of increasing subsequences.

The program seems to be missing the logic to correctly generate the desired array for a given X. The provided example outputs in the problem description show specific arrays that meet the criteria, but the given program does not appear to generate such arrays.

Correctness: **False**
