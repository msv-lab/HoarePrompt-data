The code snippet `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` appends a character to the string `ans`. The character is determined by converting the ASCII value `s[j] + 97` to a character using the `chr` function. Given that `s` is a list of length `l` with all elements initialized to 0, `s[j]` will be 0 for any valid index `j`. Therefore, `s[j] + 97` will be 97, which corresponds to the character 'a'. As a result, 'a' is appended to `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` is an input integer; `s` is a list of length `l` with all elements initialized to 0; `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `ans` is a string with the value 'a'.**
