Let's break down the given initial state and determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`i` is defined as `x + 1`**: 
   - The value of `i` is dependent on the value of `x`, which is not explicitly provided. However, this variable is not used in the `print(ans)` statement, so we can ignore it for this task.

2. **`l` is an input integer**:
   - `l` represents the length of the list `s`.

3. **`s` is a list of `l` zeros except `s[j]` which is 1 for each `j` in `array`**:
   - `s` is a list with `l` elements where all elements are initially zero.
   - For each `j` in the `array`, the element `s[j]` is set to 1.
   - This means `s` will have 1s at the indices specified by the `array` and 0s elsewhere.

4. **`array` is a list of integers from the input**:
   - `array` contains integers that specify the indices in the list `s` where the value should be 1.

5. **`ans` is a string of the first `n` letters of the alphabet where `n` is the length of `array`**:
   - `ans` is constructed by taking the first `n` letters of the alphabet.
   - `n` is the length of the `array`, which means `ans` will contain a string of consecutive letters starting from 'a'.

### Analysis:
- The `print(ans)` statement is only concerned with the variable `ans`.
- `ans` is defined as the first `n` letters of the alphabet, where `n` is the length of the `array`.

### Determining the Output:
- Since `ans` is constructed from the first `n` letters of the alphabet and `n` is the length of the `array`, the output will be a string of consecutive letters starting from 'a' up to the `n`-th letter.

### Final Output:
- Without knowing the exact length of `array`, we can describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the first n letters of the alphabet and n is the length of the array)**
