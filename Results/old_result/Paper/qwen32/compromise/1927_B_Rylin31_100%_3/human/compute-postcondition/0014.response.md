To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables `s` and `ans` based on the input `array`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (remains unchanged).
   - `l` is an input integer (remains unchanged).
   - `s` is a list of length `l` with all elements initialized to 0.
   - `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `ans` is an empty string.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each element `j` in `array`:
     - `ans` is concatenated with the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`.
     - `s[j]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Final State:**
   - After the loop completes, `s` will have been incremented at the indices corresponding to the values in `array`. Each index `j` in `s` will have a value equal to the number of times `j` appears in `array`.
   - `ans` will be a string where each character corresponds to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`, in the order they appear in `array`.

Given this, the final output state can be described as:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `l` remains the input integer.
- `s` is a list of length `l` where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j` appears in `array`.
- `array` remains the list of integers obtained from the input.
- `ans` is a string formed by concatenating characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`.

In natural language, the final output state is:

- `t` is still within the range 1 to 10^4.
- `l` is unchanged.
- `s` is a list where each element at index `j` represents how many times `j` was encountered in `array`.
- `array` is unchanged.
- `ans` is a string where each character corresponds to the number of times the respective index has been encountered in `array`, starting from 'a' (which corresponds to 0 occurrences) and increasing alphabetically.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` is an input integer; `s` is a list of length `l` where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j` appears in `array`; `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `ans` is a string formed by concatenating characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`.**
