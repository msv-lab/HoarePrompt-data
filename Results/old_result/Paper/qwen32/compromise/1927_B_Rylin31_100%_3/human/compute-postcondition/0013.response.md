The code snippet `s[j] += 1` increments the value of the element at index `j` in the list `s` by 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `l` is an input integer
- `s` is a list of length `l` with the element at index `j` incremented by 2
- `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have more than one element
- `ans` is a string with the value `'a' + chr(s[j] + 97) + chr(s[j] + 97)`
- `j` is the next element in `array`

After executing `s[j] += 1`, the element at index `j` in the list `s` will be incremented by 1 again, making the total increment from the initial state 3 instead of 2.

The output state will be:
- `t` is still an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `l` is still an input integer
- `s` is a list of length `l` with the element at index `j` incremented by 3
- `array` is still a list of integers obtained from the input and must have more than one element
- `ans` is still a string with the value `'a' + chr(s[j] + 97) + chr(s[j] + 97)` (Note: `ans` is not recalculated in the given code snippet, so it retains the value it had before the increment)
- `j` is still the next element in `array`

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` is an input integer; `s` is a list of length `l` with the element at index `j` incremented by 3; `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have more than one element; `ans` is a string with the value `'a' + chr(s[j] + 97) + chr(s[j] + 97)`; `j` is the next element in `array`.**
