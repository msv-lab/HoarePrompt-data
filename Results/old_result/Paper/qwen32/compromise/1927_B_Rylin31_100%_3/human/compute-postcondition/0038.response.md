The given code snippet appends a character to the string `ans` based on the value of `s[j]`. Here's the breakdown of the change in the state:

- `ans` is updated by appending a character. The character is determined by the ASCII value which is `s[j] + 97`. Since `s` is a list of `l` zeros, `s[j]` will be `0`. Therefore, the character appended to `ans` is `chr(0 + 97)`, which is `'a'`.

The other variables (`i`, `l`, `s`, `array`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `x + 1`, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros, `array` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is `'a'`**.
