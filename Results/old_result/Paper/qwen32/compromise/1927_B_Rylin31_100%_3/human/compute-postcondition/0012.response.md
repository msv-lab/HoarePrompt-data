The code snippet appends a character to the string `ans` based on the value of `s[j] + 97`. Given `ans` was initially `'a'` followed by the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`, the new character appended will be the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` again.

To break it down:
- `ans` was initially `'a' + chr(s[j] + 97)`.
- The code appends `chr(s[j] + 97)` to `ans`.

Therefore, the new value of `ans` will be `'a' + chr(s[j] + 97) + chr(s[j] + 97)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` is an input integer; `s` is a list of length `l` with the element at index `j` incremented by 2; `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have more than one element; `ans` is a string with the value `'a' + chr(s[j] + 97) + chr(s[j] + 97)`; `j` is the next element in `array`**.
