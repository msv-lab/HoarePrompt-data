Postcondition: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is the input integer, `nalla` is not yet initialized, `length` is 30, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element is '1' if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or '0' if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 0. If `flag` is 0 and `s[0]` is '1' and `s[1]` is '1', then `s[0]` is changed to '-1' and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0 and `s` retains its original values.**
