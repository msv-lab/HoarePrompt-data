Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `length` is 30, `s` is a list of 30 characters representing the binary form of `x`, `flag` is 0, either `flag` is not 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `length` is 30, `s` is a list of 30 characters representing the binary form of `x`. If `flag` was initially 0 and `s[i]` was '1' and `s[i + 1]` was '1', then `s[i]` is now `'-1'` and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, `s[i]` remains unchanged, and `flag` remains 0 unless it was already 1, in which case `s[i]` is set to `'0'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `length` is 30, `s` is a list of 30 characters representing the binary form of `x`. If `flag` was initially 1 and `s[i]` was '0', then `s[i]` is now `'1'` and `flag` is set to 0. Otherwise, `s[i]` remains unchanged, and `flag` remains unchanged. If `flag` was 0 and `s[i]` was equal to `s[i + 1]` and both were '1', then `s[i]` is now `'-1'` and `flag` is set to 1. `i` is `i + 1` where 0 ≤ `i` < 28.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `length` is 30, `s` is a list of 30 characters representing the binary form of `x`, and `i` is `i + 1` where 0 ≤ `i` < 28. If `flag` was true and the `i`-th character of `s` was `'0'`, then the `i`-th character of `s` is set to `'1'` and `flag` is set to 0. If `flag` is 0 or the `i`-th character of `s` is not equal to the `(i+1)`-th character or either of them is not `'1'`, then no changes are made to `s` or `flag`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
