Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is the input integer, `nalla` is not yet initialized, `length` is 30, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where `s[2]` is `'-1'` and other elements are '1' if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or '0' if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set, `flag` is 1, `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The only change made by the code is that `flag` is set to 1. All other variables retain their initial values or states.
