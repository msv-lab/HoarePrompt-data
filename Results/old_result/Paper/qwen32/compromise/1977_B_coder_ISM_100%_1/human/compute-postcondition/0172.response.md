The list `s` is updated to contain one element, `'0'`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **The list `s` is `['0']`; `length` is 30; `nalla` is 3; `t` is greater than 3; `x` is an input integer such that the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `pow(2, i)` is 0.**
