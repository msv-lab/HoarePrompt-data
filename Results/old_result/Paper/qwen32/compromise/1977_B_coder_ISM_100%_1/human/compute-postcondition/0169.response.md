To determine the postcondition, we need to incorporate all the details from the precondition and extend it to reflect the truth of the if condition. Here's the breakdown:

- Precondition states that `s` is an empty list `[]`.
- `length` is 30.
- `nalla` is 3.
- `t` must be greater than 3.
- `x` is an input integer.
- The if condition checks if `(x & pow(2, i))` is true.

The if condition `(x & pow(2, i))` implies that the `i`-th bit of `x` is set (i.e., it is 1). We don't know the exact value of `i` from the given information, but we know that the `i`-th bit of `x` must be 1 for the condition to be true.

Postcondition: **The list `s` is an empty list `[]`; `length` is 30; `nalla` is 3; `t` is greater than 3; `x` is an input integer with the `i`-th bit set to 1.**

This postcondition includes all the details from the precondition and specifies that the `i`-th bit of `x` is set to 1, which is the additional condition imposed by the if statement.
