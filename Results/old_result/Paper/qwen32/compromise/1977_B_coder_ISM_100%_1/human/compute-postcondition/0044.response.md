Postcondition: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is the input integer, `nalla` is not yet initialized, `length` is 30, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element is '1' if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or '0' if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set. If `flag` was initially 1 and `s[1]` was '0', then `s[1]` is now '1'. `flag` is 0, `i` is 1.**
