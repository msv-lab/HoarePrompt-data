Postcondition: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `length` is 30, `s` is a list of 30 characters representing the binary form of `x`. If `flag` is 1, the character at index `i` in `s` is set to `'0'`. `flag` remains 1 if it was initially 1, otherwise it remains 0. Either `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'.**
