The list `s` originally contains either `['1', '1']`, `['0', '1']`, `['1', '0']`, or `['0', '0']`. After executing `s.append('0')`, the list `s` will have an additional element `'0'` appended to it. Thus, the new possible states of `s` are `['1', '1', '0']`, `['0', '1', '0']`, `['1', '0', '0']`, or `['0', '0', '0']`.

The values of `length`, `nalla`, and `t` remain unchanged, with `length` being 30, `nalla` being 3, and `t` being greater than 3. `x` remains an input integer, and `i` is still 30.

Output State: **The list `s` contains either `['1', '1', '0']`, `['0', '1', '0']`, `['1', '0', '0']`, or `['0', '0', '0']`; `length` is 30; `nalla` is 3; `t` is greater than 3; `x` is an input integer; `i` is 30.**
