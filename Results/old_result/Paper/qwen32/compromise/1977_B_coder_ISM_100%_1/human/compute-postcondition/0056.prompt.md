Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is the input integer, `nalla` is not yet initialized, `length` is 30, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element is '1' if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or '0' if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set, `flag` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is the input integer, `nalla` is not yet initialized, `length` is 30, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element is '1' if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or '0' if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 0. If `flag` is 0 and `s[0]` is '1' and `s[1]` is '1', then `s[0]` is changed to '-1' and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0 and `s` retains its original values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is the input integer, `nalla` is not yet initialized, `length` is 30, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element is '1' if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or '0' if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set. If `flag` was initially 0 and `s[i]` was '1' and `s[i+1]` was '1', then `s[1]` is '-1' and `flag` is 1. Otherwise, if `flag` was initially 1 and `s[1]` was '0', then `s[1]` is now '1'. `flag` is 0 or 1 depending on the conditions met, and `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is the input integer, `nalla` is not yet initialized, `length` is 30, `i` is 2. If `flag` was initially 0 and `s[2]` was '1' and `s[3]` was '1', then `s[2]` is now `'-1'`, `s[3]` remains '1', and `flag` is 1. Otherwise, if `flag` was initially 1, then `s[3]` is now '0' and other elements of `s` remain unchanged based on the initial conditions. If neither condition is met, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element is '1' if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or '0' if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set, with modifications based on the initial `flag` value as described in the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
