Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `x` and processes it to produce a binary-like string representation of `x` with specific transformations applied. It then prints the length of the transformed string and the transformed string itself. The transformation involves replacing consecutive '1's with a special marker and adjusting the string based on certain rules, potentially increasing its length.**
