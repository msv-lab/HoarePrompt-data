Postcondition: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is the input integer, `nalla` is not yet initialized, `length` is 30, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element is '1' if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or '0' if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set, with '-1' replacing the first of any consecutive '1's and '0' replacing the second of those consecutive '1's, and `flag` is 0. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'.**
