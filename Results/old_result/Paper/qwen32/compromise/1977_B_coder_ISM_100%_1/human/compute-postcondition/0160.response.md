Postcondition: **`length` is greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `s[i]` is `'0'` and `s[i - 1]` is `'-1'`, then the condition `(s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1')` was false, and `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the condition was true, and `s[i]` is `'0'` and `s[i - 1]` is `'-1'`.**
