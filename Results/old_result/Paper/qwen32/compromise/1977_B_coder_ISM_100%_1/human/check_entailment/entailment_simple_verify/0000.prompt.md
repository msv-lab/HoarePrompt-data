You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1
    
    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the requirement that no two consecutive elements in the array should be non-zero. Let's analyze the code to see why it fails:

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Consecutive Non-Zero Elements:**
   - The code attempts to fix consecutive non-zero elements by setting one of them to `0` and the other to `-1`. However, this approach can lead to incorrect results because it doesn't properly account for the binary representation and the requirement that the sum of the series equals `x`.

2. **Appending Elements Incorrectly:**
   - The code appends an extra `1` to the list if the last element is `0` and `flag` is set. This can result in an incorrect length and values in the array.

3. **Binary Representation Handling:**
   - The initial binary representation conversion does not consider the possibility of needing `-1` values to adjust the sum correctly.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Let's take the input `x = 15`:
- Binary representation of 15 is `1111`.
- The initial list `s` will be `['1', '1', '1', '1']`.
- The code will then attempt to fix consecutive non-zero elements, but it will fail to do so correctly and may end up with an incorrect array.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve iterating through the binary representation and adjusting the values to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements exist while maintaining the sum equal to `x`.

Here is a corrected version of the code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        s = []
        i = 0
        while x > 0:
            if x & 1:
                if i > 0 and s[-1] != 0:
                    s[-1] = -1
                    x += 1
                s.append(1)
            else:
                s.append(0)
            x >>= 1
            i += 1
        while i < 32:
            s.append(0)
            i += 1
        print(len(s))
        print(*s)

func()
```

This corrected code ensures that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist and maintains the sum equal to `x`. It also ensures that the length of the array does not exceed 32.
