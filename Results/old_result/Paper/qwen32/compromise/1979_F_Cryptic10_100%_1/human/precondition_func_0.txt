The function `func()` does not take any input parameters. The input for the function is provided interactively through standard input, where the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of vertices in the graph. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The function must interact with the interactor by making queries of the form "? d" (0 ≤ d ≤ n - 1) and receiving responses, and finally output the Hamiltonian path in the format "! v_1 v_2 ... v_n".
