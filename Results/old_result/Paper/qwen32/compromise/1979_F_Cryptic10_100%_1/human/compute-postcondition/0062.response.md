Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1`, `v2`, and potentially `v3` if `v2` was not greater than 0; `n` must be at least 5; `v1` is `v1_new` and `v2` is `v2_new`; `ops` includes the tuple `(v1_new, v2_new)` if `v2_new` is greater than 0, otherwise `vx` also excludes `v3` where `v3` is the first value returned by `q(0)`, and `ops` includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1_new, 0)`. Additionally, `ops` now includes the tuple `(v1, v2)`.**

Explanation: The only change is that the `ops` list now includes an additional tuple `(v1, v2)`. All other variables and conditions remain the same.
