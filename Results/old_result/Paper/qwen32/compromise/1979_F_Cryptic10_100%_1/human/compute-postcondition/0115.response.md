After the loop executes all the iterations, the final state of the variables will reflect that all test cases have been processed, and for each test case, a Hamiltonian path has been determined and printed. Here's the detailed output state:

- `vx` will be an empty set at the end of each test case since all vertices will have been removed from it.
- `ops` will be an empty list at the end of each test case since all operations will have been processed.
- `p1` and `p2` will be lists that, when combined and reversed, form the Hamiltonian path for the current test case.
- The final output for each test case will be printed in the format "! v_1 v_2 ... v_n".

The final state after all iterations is:

Output State: **`vx` is an empty set, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` and `p2` are lists forming the Hamiltonian path for the current test case, and the Hamiltonian path is printed for each test case.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations are complete, each test case will have had its Hamiltonian path determined and printed, and the intermediate sets and lists used to construct this path will be reset for the next test case.
