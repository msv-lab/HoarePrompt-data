The only objects in the loop head are `v1` and `v2`, which are obtained from the reversed `ops` list. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the structure of the `ops` list and how the loop iterates over it in reverse order.

Given that the loop iterates over `ops[::-1]`, the next iteration will take the next tuple `(v1, v2)` from the reversed list. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `v1` and `v2` reflect the next tuple in the reversed `ops` list.

Let's denote the current state at the end of the previous iteration as:
- `ops` is a list of tuples, and the last iteration processed the tuple at index `k` in the reversed list.

For the next iteration, the tuple at index `k-1` in the reversed list (which is the tuple at index `len(ops) - k - 1` in the original list) will be processed. Therefore, `v1` and `v2` should be the elements of that tuple.

Since we do not have the exact content of `ops`, we cannot specify the exact values of `v1` and `v2`. However, we can describe the state in terms of the next tuple in the reversed list.

State: **`ops` is a list of tuples, and `v1`, `v2` are the elements of the next tuple in the reversed `ops` list.**
