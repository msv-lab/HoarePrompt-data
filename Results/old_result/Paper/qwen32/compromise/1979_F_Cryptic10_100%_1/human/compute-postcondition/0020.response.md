Postcondition: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `t` (inclusive) except `v1` and `v2` (if `v2` was originally in the set and not equal to `v1`). If `v2 > 0`, `ops` includes the new tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2 <= 0`, `v1` and `v3` are distinct, `vx` also excludes `v3` (if `v3` was originally in the set), `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)`, and `ops` is updated to include the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`.**
