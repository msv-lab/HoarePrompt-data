Initial State: `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` excluding `v1` and `v3` (if `v2` is not greater than 0), `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, and `n` must be at least 5.

After executing the code `vx.remove(v1)`, the value `v1` is removed from the set `vx`. Therefore, `vx` will no longer contain `v1`.

Output State: **`vx` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` excluding `v1`, `v3` (if `v2` is not greater than 0), and `v1` is the value returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` before removal, `v2` is the value returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` before removal, and `n` must be at least 5.**
