Output State: **`vx` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` excluding `v1` and `v3` (if `v2` is not greater than 0), `v1` is the value returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` before removal, `v2` is the value returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` before removal, `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)`, and `n` must be at least 5; `ops` includes the additional tuple `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`**.

In simple terms, the set `vx` remains unchanged, and the variables `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` retain their previous values. The list `ops` now includes two additional tuples: `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`.
