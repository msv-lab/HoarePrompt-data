To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The code snippet is:
```
(p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers.
- `p1` is a list containing the integers 1, 2, and 3.
- `p2` is an empty list.
- `ops` is a list containing at least two tuples.

The code snippet checks if the last element of `p1` (which is 3) is equal to `v2`. If it is, it appends `v1` to `p2`. Otherwise, it appends `v1` to `p1`.

Since `v2` is not defined in the initial state, we can assume `v2` is not equal to 3 (the last element of `p1`). Therefore, the `else` part of the conditional expression is executed, and `v1` is appended to `p1`.

Thus, the output state is:
- `vx` remains a set containing exactly 2 integers.
- `p1` now contains the integers 1, 2, 3, and `v1`.
- `p2` remains an empty list.
- `ops` remains a list containing at least two tuples.

Output State: **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers; `p1` is a list containing the integers 1, 2, 3, and `v1`; `p2` is an empty list; `ops` is a list containing at least two tuples.**
