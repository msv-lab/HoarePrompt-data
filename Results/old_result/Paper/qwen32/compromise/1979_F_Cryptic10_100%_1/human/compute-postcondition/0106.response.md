The code snippet converts the set `vx` into a list and assigns it to `p1`, while `p2` is initialized as an empty list. The initial state specifies that `vx` is a set containing either 1 or 2 elements. Since `vx` is converted to a list, `p1` will now be a list with 1 or 2 elements, depending on the initial size of `vx`. The variable `p2` is explicitly set to an empty list.

Output State: **`vx` is a set containing 1 or 2 elements, `ops` is a list of tuples that records all the removals and associated operations, `p1` is a list containing the same elements as `vx`, `p2` is an empty list.**
