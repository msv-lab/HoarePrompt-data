The code appends a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. The values of `vx`, `p1`, `p2`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged. The only change is that `ops` now contains the new tuple.

Output State: **`vx` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` excluding `v1`, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)`, `p1` and `p2` retain their initial states, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(n - 2)`, and `v2` is greater than 0.**
