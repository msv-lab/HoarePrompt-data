Postcondition: **`vx` has at least 1 element after the removals; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` before the removal. If `v2 > 0`, `ops` includes the tuple `(v1, v2)` at the end. Otherwise, `v3` is the first value returned by `q(0)` and has been removed from `vx`, and `ops` includes the additional tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`.**
