Postcondition: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1` and `v2`; `n` must be at least 5; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(n - 3)`. If `v2` is greater than 0, `ops` includes the tuple `(v1, v2)`. Otherwise, `vx` also excludes `v3` where `v3` is the first value returned by `q(0)`, and `ops` includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`**.
