Let's break down the given precondition and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`vx`**: A set containing exactly 2 integers. For example, `vx = {1, 2}`.
2. **`p1`**: A list starting with the integers from `vx` and then including all `v1` values from `ops` (where `v1` is the first element of each tuple in `ops`), with duplicates if `v1 != v2`.
3. **`p2`**: A list containing any `v1` values that were transferred from `p1` because `p1[-1] == v2`. This implies that whenever the last element of `p1` matches the `v2` value of an operation in `ops`, that `v1` value is moved to `p2`.
4. **`ops`**: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `v1` and `v2`.

### Example Scenario:
Let's assume the following for a concrete example:
- `vx = {1, 2}`
- `ops = [(3, 1), (4, 2), (5, 3), (6, 4)]`

#### Step-by-Step Construction of `p1` and `p2`:
1. **Initial `p1`**: Start with the elements of `vx`, so `p1 = [1, 2]`.
2. **Processing `ops`**:
    - **First Operation (3, 1)**: `v1 = 3`, `v2 = 1`. Add `v1` to `p1` because `v1 != v2`. Now, `p1 = [1, 2, 3]`.
    - **Second Operation (4, 2)**: `v1 = 4`, `v2 = 2`. Add `v1` to `p1` because `v1 != v2`. Now, `p1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]`.
    - **Third Operation (5, 3)**: `v1 = 5`, `v2 = 3`. Add `v1` to `p1` because `v1 != v2`. Now, `p1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
    - **Fourth Operation (6, 4)**: `v1 = 6`, `v2 = 4`. Add `v1` to `p1` because `v1 != v2`. Now, `p1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
3. **Checking for `p2`**:
    - After processing all operations, check if any `v1` values need to be transferred to `p2` because the last element of `p1` matches `v2` of any operation.
    - In this example, none of the last elements of `p1` (which are 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1) match `v2` values of any operation, so `p2` remains empty: `p2 = []`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)
```
- **`p1[::-1]`**: This reverses the list `p1`. So, if `p1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, then `p1[::-1] = [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.
- **`p1[::-1] + p2`**: Concatenates the reversed `p1` with `p2`. Since `p2` is empty, the result is `[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.
- **`' '.join(map(str, ...))`**: Converts each element of the list to a string and joins them with spaces. So, `[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` becomes `'6 5 4 3 2 1'`.
- **`'! %s' % ...`**: Formats the string to include the exclamation mark at the beginning. So, the final string is `'! 6 5 4 3 2 1'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **! 6 5 4 3 2 1 (where p1 is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and p2 is [])**
