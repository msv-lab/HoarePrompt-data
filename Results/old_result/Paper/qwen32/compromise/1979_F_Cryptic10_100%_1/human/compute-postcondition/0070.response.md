Let's break down the code snippet to understand its impact on the variables.

The initial state is:
- `vx` contains 1 or 2 elements.
- `ops` contains at least one tuple with two elements.
- `p1` is a list containing the same elements as `vx`.
- `p2` is an empty list.

The code snippet is:
```python
(p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)
```

Here's the step-by-step impact:
- The code checks if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`.
- If `p1[-1] == v2`, it appends `v1` to `p2`.
- If `p1[-1] != v2`, it appends `v1` to `p1`.

Since the initial state does not specify the values of `v1` and `v2`, we need to consider these possibilities:
- If `p1[-1] == v2`, then `p2` will have `v1` appended to it, and `p1` will remain unchanged.
- If `p1[-1] != v2`, then `p1` will have `v1` appended to it, and `p2` will remain unchanged.

Since the exact values of `v1` and `v2` are not given, we can only describe the output state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`vx` contains 1 or 2 elements; `ops` contains at least one tuple with two elements; if `p1[-1] == v2` then `p1` contains the same elements as `vx` and `p2` contains `v1`, otherwise `p1` contains the same elements as `vx` with `v1` appended and `p2` is an empty list.**
