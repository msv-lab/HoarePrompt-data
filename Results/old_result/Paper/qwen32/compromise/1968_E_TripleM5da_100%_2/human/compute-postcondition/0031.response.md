Given the initial state, we know that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 5, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 5. However, the print statement only involves the variable `i`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(i, i)
```

Since `i` is explicitly given as 5, the print statement will output the value of `i` twice.

Output: **5, 5**
