To determine the necessary state adjustments for the given for loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if the range `(3, n + 1)` is non-empty, meaning `n` must be at least 3.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50 (this variable is not used in the loop head and thus does not need adjustment for the loop to execute).
- `n` is the integer value provided by the input, where 2 <= `n` <= 10^3.

The loop:
```python
for i in range(3, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 3. If `n` is 2 or less, the range `(3, n + 1)` would be empty, and the loop would not execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least 3. The variable `i` does not need to be set before the loop starts since it is initialized by the range function.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` must be at least 3**
