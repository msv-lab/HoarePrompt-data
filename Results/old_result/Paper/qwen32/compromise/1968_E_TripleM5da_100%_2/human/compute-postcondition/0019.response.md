The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` must be at least 3. Since the loop iterates from 3 to `n` inclusive, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 4. For the loop to continue executing, `n` must be at least 4.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 4, `n` must be at least 4**
