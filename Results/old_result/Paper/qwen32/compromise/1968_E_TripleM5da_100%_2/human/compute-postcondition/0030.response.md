The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is in the range from 3 to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 5. The value of `n` must still be greater than or equal to 5 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 5, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5**
