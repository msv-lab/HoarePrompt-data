The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from 3 to `n` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value between 3 and `n-1`, and `n` is at least 3.

To execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must remain at least 3. 

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration is `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` must be at least 3, and `i` must be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus one.

Let's assume `i` was 3 at the start of the previous iteration, so at the end of the previous iteration `i` would be 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be 5, and `n` must still be at least 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 4, `n` must be at least 3**

Adjusting `i` for the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 5, `n` must be at least 3**

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 5, `n` must be at least 3**
