The given initial state only describes the constraints for the variables `t` and `n`. Specifically, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, and `n` must be at least 3. However, the code snippet provided attempts to print the variable `i` twice, but `i` is not defined in the given initial state.

Since `i` is not defined, the code would result in a `NameError` when executed. However, if we are to strictly adhere to the task of describing what would be printed based on the given precondition and the code snippet, we must acknowledge that the variable `i` is not defined.

Therefore, the most precise description of the output, considering the given information, would be that the variable `i` is not defined and thus the code would raise an error. However, since the task asks for what will be printed and not the error handling, we will describe it as undefined.

Output: **i, i (where i is not defined)**
