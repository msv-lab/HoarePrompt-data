Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). Specifically, the program only works correctly for \(n = 2\). For \(n \geq 3\), the program does not generate the points in a way that maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

Let's analyze the program with an example:

For \(n = 3\):
- The program outputs:
  ```
  1 1
  1 2
  3 3
  ```
- The Manhattan distances between these points are:
  - Between (1,1) and (1,2): \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
  - Between (1,1) and (3,3): \(|1-3| + |1-3| = 4\)
  - Between (1,2) and (3,3): \(|1-3| + |2-3| = 3\)
- The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{1, 3, 4\}\), which has a size of 3.

However, for \(n = 3\), a better arrangement would be:
- Points: (2,1), (2,3), (3,1)
- Manhattan distances:
  - Between (2,1) and (2,3): \(|2-2| + |1-3| = 2\)
  - Between (2,1) and (3,1): \(|2-3| + |1-1| = 1\)
  - Between (2,3) and (3,1): \(|2-3| + |3-1| = 3\)
- The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), which also has a size of 3, but this arrangement is more optimal for larger \(n\) as it can be extended to cover more distances.

For \(n = 4\):
- The program outputs:
  ```
  1 1
  1 2
  3 3
  4 4
  ```
- The Manhattan distances between these points are:
  - Between (1,1) and (1,2): 1
  - Between (1,1) and (3,3): 4
  - Between (1,1) and (4,4): 6
  - Between (1,2) and (3,3): 3
  - Between (1,2) and (4,4): 5
  - Between (3,3) and (4,4): 1
- The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{1, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), which has a size of 5.

However, a better arrangement for \(n = 4\) would be:
- Points: (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4)
- Manhattan distances:
  - Between (1,1) and (1,3): 2
  - Between (1,1) and (4,3): 5
  - Between (1,1) and (4,4): 6
  - Between (1,3) and (4,3): 3
  - Between (1,3) and (4,4): 4
  - Between (4,3) and (4,4): 1
- The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), which has a size of 6.

Thus, the program does not always generate the optimal set of points to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). Therefore, it is incorrect.
