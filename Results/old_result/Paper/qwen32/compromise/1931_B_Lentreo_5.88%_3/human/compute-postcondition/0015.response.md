Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `last` is `i` from the previous iteration, `i` is the next element in `nums`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `curr` is increased by `i - last`. Otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged.**
