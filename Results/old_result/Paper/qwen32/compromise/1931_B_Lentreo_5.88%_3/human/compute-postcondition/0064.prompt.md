Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of a_i for each test case is divisible by `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    last = nums[-1]
    curr = 0
    for i in nums:
        if i != 0:
            curr += i - last
    if curr == 0:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `curr` is the sum of `i - last` for all non-zero `i` in `nums`, and `last` is the last element of `nums`. If `curr` is 0, then the current value of `curr` remains 0. Otherwise, `curr` is not equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `nums` is the original list of integers, `curr` is the sum of `(i - last)` for each non-zero `i` in `nums`, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `t` is unchanged, and `n` is unchanged. If `curr` is 0, then `curr` remains 0. Otherwise, `curr` is not 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `nums` is unchanged, `curr` is the sum of `i - last` for all non-zero `i` in `nums`, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged. If `curr` is 0, the sum of `i - last` for all non-zero `i` in `nums` is 0. Otherwise, `curr` is not equal to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
