To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand how the variables `curr` and `last` are updated during each iteration. The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `nums`. If `i` is not 0, `curr` is updated by adding `i - last` to it. The variable `last` remains unchanged throughout the loop.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `nums`: List of integers from the input.
   - `curr`: 0.
   - `last`: The last element of `nums`.
   - `t`: Unchanged (not affected by the loop).
   - `n`: An input integer (not affected by the loop).

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each element `i` in `nums`:
     - If `i` is not 0, `curr` is updated to `curr + i - last`.
     - `last` remains the same.

3. **Final State**:
   - After all elements in `nums` have been processed, `curr` will have accumulated the sum of `i - last` for all non-zero `i` in `nums`.
   - `last` will still hold its original value, which is the last element of `nums`.
   - `nums`, `t`, and `n` will remain unchanged.

To summarize, the final output state is:

Output State: **`nums` is unchanged, `curr` is the sum of `i - last` for all non-zero `i` in `nums`, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged.**

In simpler terms, `curr` will be the accumulated sum of differences between each non-zero element in `nums` and the last element of `nums`, while `last` will still be the last element of the original list `nums`.
