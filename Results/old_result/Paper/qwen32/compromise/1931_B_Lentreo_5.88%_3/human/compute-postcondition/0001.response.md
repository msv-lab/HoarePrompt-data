The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the range it iterates over is `t`. Therefore, the state of `t` is the only one that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. The loop will execute `t` times, and since `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), no adjustment to `t` is necessary to ensure the loop executes at least once.

The variables `n` and `a` are defined within the loop body, so they do not need to be adjusted in the state before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
