To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to carefully analyze how the variables `curr` and `last` change during each iteration of the loop.

The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `nums`. For each element, if `i` is not equal to 0, `curr` is updated by adding the difference between `i` and `last`. The variable `last` is not modified within the loop; it retains the value of the last element of the list `nums` throughout the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `nums` is a list of integers.
- `curr` is initialized to 0.
- `last` is the last element of `nums`.
- `t` is decremented by 1 (though `t` is not used within the loop, so it remains unchanged for our purposes).
- `n` is an input integer (though `n` is not used within the loop, so it remains unchanged for our purposes).

### Iteration Analysis:
1. **First Iteration**: 
   - `i` is the first element of `nums`.
   - If `i != 0`, then `curr` becomes `0 + (i - last)`.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - `i` is the second element of `nums`.
   - If `i != 0`, then `curr` becomes `curr + (i - last)`.

3. **Third Iteration**:
   - `i` is the third element of `nums`.
   - If `i != 0`, then `curr` becomes `curr + (i - last)`.

This pattern continues for each element in `nums`. Therefore, the final value of `curr` after all iterations will be the sum of `(i - last)` for each non-zero `i` in `nums`.

### Final Output State:
- `nums` remains the same list of integers.
- `curr` is the sum of `(i - last)` for each non-zero `i` in `nums`.
- `last` remains the last element of `nums`.
- `t` remains unchanged (though it is not used in the loop).
- `n` remains unchanged (though it is not used in the loop).

Output State: **`nums` is the original list of integers, `curr` is the sum of `(i - last)` for each non-zero `i` in `nums`, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `t` is unchanged, and `n` is unchanged.**
