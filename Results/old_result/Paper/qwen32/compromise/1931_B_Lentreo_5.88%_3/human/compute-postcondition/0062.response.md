The `print('NO')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `nums`, `curr`, `last`, `t`, or `n`. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Here's the breakdown:
- The `print` statement is given as `print('NO')`.
- The string `'NO'` is explicitly provided and does not change based on any variable or condition in the initial state.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
