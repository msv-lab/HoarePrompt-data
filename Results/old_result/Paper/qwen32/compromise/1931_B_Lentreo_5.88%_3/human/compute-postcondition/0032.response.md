The code snippet `curr += i - last` updates the value of `curr` by adding the difference between `i` and `last` to it. The values of `nums`, `i`, and `last` remain unchanged, except for `curr` which is updated based on the operation.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the next element in `nums`, `last` is the previous element in `nums`, `curr` is updated to `curr + (i - last)`**.
