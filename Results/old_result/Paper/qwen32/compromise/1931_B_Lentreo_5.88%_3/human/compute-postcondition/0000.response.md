Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of a_i for each test case is divisible by `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of the integer input, which is still within the given constraints. All other variables (`n`, `a`) and their constraints remain unchanged as they have not been modified by the code snippet provided.
