The value of `curr` is updated by adding the difference between `i` and `last` to its current value. The values of `t`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `last` is `i` from the previous iteration, `i` is the next element in `nums`, and `curr` is increased by `i - last`.
