The `print('NO')` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `curr`, `last`, or `nums`. The string `'NO'` is explicitly provided within the `print` function.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes the computation of `curr` and the value of `last`, but these values are not used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is simply outputting the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
