Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element; `curr` is updated to `curr + i - last`; `i` is not equal to 0; `last` remains unchanged.**

In natural language: The list `nums` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. The variable `curr` is updated to its previous value plus the result of `i - last`. The variable `i` retains its value and is still not equal to 0. The variable `last` also remains unchanged.
