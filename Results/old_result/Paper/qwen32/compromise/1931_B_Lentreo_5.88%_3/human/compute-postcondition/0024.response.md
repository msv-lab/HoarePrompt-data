The code snippet provided is:

```python
nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
```

This line of code takes an input string, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the string into components based on whitespace, converts each component to an integer, and then assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `nums`.

Given the initial state:
- `curr` is the sum of `i - last` for all non-zero `i` in `nums`
- `last` is the last element of `nums`
- `t` is decremented by 1
- `n` is an input integer

The variable `nums` is being reassigned, which means the previous values of `curr`, `last`, and `t` are still valid, but `nums` will now hold the new list of integers provided by the input.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers from the input; `curr` is the sum of `i - last` for all non-zero `i` in the previous `nums`; `last` is the last element of the previous `nums`; `t` is decremented by 1; `n` is an input integer.**
