Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then checks if the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in the list and the last element of the list equals zero. If this condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**
