### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its function summary in the context of the problem description and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We have `n` containers with water amounts `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
- The sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.
- We can pour water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.
- We need to determine if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to determine if the water can be evenly distributed by summing the differences between each element and the last element. This approach is flawed and does not correctly address the problem requirements.

#### Function Summary:
- The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and the list `nums`.
- It calculates `curr` by summing the differences between each non-zero element and the last element.
- If `curr` is zero, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Balance:**
   - The logic of summing differences between each element and the last element does not ensure that the cumulative water in each prefix can be evenly distributed.
   - The correct approach should be to check if the cumulative sum of water up to each container can be divided evenly by the target amount of water per container.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled:**
   - The program fails to handle cases where the water distribution can be balanced even if the last element is not the pivot for balancing.

#### Example Illustration:
Consider the test case:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
- The total water is 6, and it can be evenly distributed to 2 units in each container.
- The provided program incorrectly outputs "NO" because it relies on an incorrect balancing logic.

#### Correct Approach:
The correct approach involves checking if the cumulative sum of water up to each container can be divided evenly by the target amount of water per container. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total = sum(nums)
        target = total // n
        curr = 0
        possible = True
        for i in range(n):
            curr += nums[i]
            if curr % target != 0:
                possible = False
                break
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly determine if the water can be evenly distributed using the described operation. The logic in the program is incorrect and does not consider the problem requirements properly.

### Final: **False**
