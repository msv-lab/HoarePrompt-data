You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of a_i for each test case is divisible by n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    #State: The loop has executed `t` times. For each test case, `curr` is the sum of `i - last` for all non-zero `i` in `nums`, where `last` is the last element of `nums`. If `curr` is 0, the program prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The variables `t`, `n`, and `nums` remain unchanged throughout the loop except within the scope of each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to determine if we can make all the containers have the same amount of water by pouring water from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index. The total amount of water is guaranteed to be divisible by the number of containers.

### Key Insight:
For it to be possible to equalize the water in all containers, we need to ensure that at each step, we can pour water from higher-indexed containers to lower-indexed ones, ultimately achieving a uniform distribution of water. Given the constraints and the operation allowed, the problem can be simplified by checking if the cumulative difference between the current container's water level and the last container's water level is balanced out.

### Analysis of the Program:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the list of water amounts and calculating the cumulative difference between each container's water amount and the last container's water amount. If this cumulative difference is zero, the program outputs "YES", indicating that it's possible to equalize the water levels. Otherwise, it outputs "NO".

However, there are several issues with the provided program:
1. The program incorrectly calculates the cumulative difference. It initializes `curr` to 0 and then iterates through the list `nums`. For each element `i` in `nums`, it adds `i - last` to `curr`. The variable `last` is set to `nums[-1]` before the loop starts, and it never changes. This means that the program is actually checking the difference between each element and the last element, which is not the correct approach to determine if we can equalize the water levels.

2. The logic of the program is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the process of pouring water from higher-indexed containers to lower-indexed ones. The correct approach would involve ensuring that the cumulative water amount up to each container (after adjusting for the average) is balanced.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we can follow these steps:
1. Calculate the target water level for each container, which is the total amount of water divided by the number of containers.
2. Iterate through the list of water amounts and keep a running total of the difference between the current cumulative water amount and the expected cumulative water amount (i.e., the target water level times the number of containers seen so far).
3. If the running total of this difference is zero at the end of the iteration, it means we can equalize the water levels. Otherwise, we cannot.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Reasoning: The provided program incorrectly calculates the cumulative difference and does not correctly simulate the process of pouring water from higher-indexed containers to lower-indexed ones.
Correctness: **False**
