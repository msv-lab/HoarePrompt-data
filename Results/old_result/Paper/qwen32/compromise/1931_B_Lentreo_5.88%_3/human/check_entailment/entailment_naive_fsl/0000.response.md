Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The logic in the program is incorrect and does not consider the problem requirements properly.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Balance:**
   - The program calculates `curr` by summing up the differences between each element and the last element of the list. This approach does not correctly assess whether the water can be evenly distributed.
   - The correct approach should involve checking if the cumulative sum of water up to each container can be balanced such that the water can be evenly distributed.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the water distribution can be balanced even if the last element is not the pivot for balancing.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation:**
- The total water is 6, and it can be evenly distributed to 2 units in each container.
- The program would incorrectly output "NO" for this case because it relies on an incorrect balancing logic.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total = sum(nums)
        target = total // n
        curr = 0
        possible = True
        for i in range(n):
            curr += nums[i]
            if curr % target != 0:
                possible = False
                break
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

In this corrected version, the program checks if the cumulative sum of water up to each container can be divided evenly by the target amount of water per container. If at any point the cumulative sum cannot be evenly divided, it concludes that it is not possible to balance the water.
