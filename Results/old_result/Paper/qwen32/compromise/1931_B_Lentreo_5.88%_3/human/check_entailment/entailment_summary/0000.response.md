### Reasoning:

The given program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The logic in the program is flawed because it incorrectly assumes that the sum of differences between each non-zero element and the last element being zero is a sufficient condition for equalizing the water in all containers.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should check if the water in all containers can be made equal to the average amount of water per container, which is the total amount of water divided by the number of containers. This is because the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by `n`, ensuring that an equal distribution is possible.

The program should calculate the average and then determine if it is possible to redistribute the water such that each container holds this average amount. The provided program does not perform this check and instead uses an incorrect condition to determine the answer.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
