You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            (s[right], s[left]) = (s[left], s[right])
            cost += right - left + 1
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
    return cost



- Function Summary: 
The function takes a list of binary strings (`sChar`) and calculates the total cost required to rearrange each string such that all '0's come before all '1's. The cost is determined by the number of swaps needed to achieve this configuration, and the function returns the accumulated cost for all strings in the list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find the minimum cost required to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. A cyclic shift involves moving the last character of a substring to the front of that substring. The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a binary string. For each string, it calls `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost to sort the string.

#### Function `func_1`
- **Initialization**: 
  - `s` is converted from a string to a list of characters.
  - `left` and `right` pointers are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively.
  - `cost` is initialized to 0.
  
- **Main Loop**:
  - The loop continues as long as `left <= right`, `right < len(s)`, and `left < len(s)`.
  - If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', the characters at these positions are swapped, and the cost is incremented by `right - left + 1`.
  - The `right` pointer is moved forward until it points to a '0'.
  - The `left` pointer is moved forward until it points to a '1'.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation is flawed because it only considers swapping '1's with '0's directly adjacent to each other. This does not account for the minimum cost required to sort the entire string.
   
2. **Inefficient Sorting Strategy**:
   - The program does not guarantee that the string will be sorted after the operations. It only swaps '1's and '0's when they are adjacent, which may not result in a fully sorted string.

3. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The loop condition `left <= right` is problematic because it can lead to an infinite loop or incorrect behavior if `left` and `right` pointers do not move correctly.
   - The program does not handle cases where there are multiple '1's and '0's that need to be rearranged in a specific order to achieve a sorted string.

### Correctness
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string as per the problem requirements.

**Correctness: False**
