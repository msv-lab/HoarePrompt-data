Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to transform a binary string `s` into a non-descending order (all 0s followed by all 1s) using the minimum cost.
- The cost of an operation is defined as the length of the substring that is cyclically shifted.
- We can perform this operation any number of times.

### Analysis of the Provided Code:

#### Structure:
- The code reads multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` with the binary string `s`.
- The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the minimum cost to sort the string.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Converts the input string `sChar` into a list `s`.
   - Initializes `left` pointer at 0, `cost` at 0, and `right` pointer at 1.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop condition checks if `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `right` is within bounds, and `left` is within bounds.
   - If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', it swaps these elements and adds the cost `(right - left + 1)` to the total cost.
   - It then moves the `right` pointer forward until it finds a '0'.
   - Similarly, it moves the `left` pointer forward until it finds a '1'.

3. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the accumulated `cost`.

### Issues in the Code:
- **Incorrect Logic**: The logic for swapping and calculating the cost does not correctly simulate the cyclic shift operation. The problem requires cyclic shifting of substrings, but the code simply swaps individual characters without considering the effect on the rest of the string.
- **Loop Conditions**: The loop conditions and the way pointers are moved do not guarantee that all necessary swaps are performed to achieve the sorted order.
- **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation does not reflect the actual cost of performing cyclic shifts on substrings.

### Example Walkthrough:
Consider the example `s = "101011"`:
- The correct approach would involve identifying substrings that need to be cyclically shifted to bring all '0's to the front.
- However, the provided code might incorrectly swap individual characters and calculate the cost based on incorrect assumptions.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the required algorithm to solve the problem. It fails to accurately simulate the cyclic shift operation and does not guarantee the minimum cost to sort the string.

**Correctness: False**
