Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0's and '1's, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, the total length of all strings in `sChar` does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `s` is a list containing all the elements from `sChar` in the same order; `left` is 0; `cost` is 0; `right` is 1.
Code of the loop:
while left <= right and right < len(s) and left < len(s):
    if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
        s[right], s[left] = s[left], s[right]
        cost += right - left + 1
    while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
        right += 1
    while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
        left += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: - `left` will be the index of the first '1' in `s` or the length of `s` if there are no '1's.
- `right` remains the same as it was initially.

Thus, the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations is:

Output State:
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `left` is the index of the next '1' in `s` starting from its initial position, or the length of `s` if no '1' is found; `right` remains unchanged; `s` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `right` is the smallest index such that `right >= len(s)` or `s[right] == '0'`; `left` is the smallest index such that `left >= len(s)` or `s[left] == '1'`; `s` and `cost` remain unchanged unless the swap condition is met outside the loop.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
