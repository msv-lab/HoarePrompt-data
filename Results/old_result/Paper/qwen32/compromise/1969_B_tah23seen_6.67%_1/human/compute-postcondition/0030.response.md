To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

```
while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Conditions Analysis:
1. `left <= right`: This condition ensures that `left` is not greater than `right`.
2. `right < len(s)`: This condition ensures that `right` is within the bounds of the string `s`.
3. `left < len(s)`: This condition ensures that `left` is within the bounds of the string `s`.

### Current State:
- `left` will be the index of the first '1' in `s` or the length of `s` if there are no '1's.
- `right` remains the same as it was initially.

### Adjustment Requirements:
1. **Ensure `left <= right`**: Since `left` is either the index of the first '1' or the length of `s`, and `right` remains the same, we need to ensure that `right` is not less than `left`. If `left` is the length of `s` (meaning there are no '1's), then `right` should be at least the length of `s` or less.
2. **Ensure `right < len(s)`**: This means `right` should be a valid index in the string `s`.
3. **Ensure `left < len(s)`**: This means `left` should be a valid index in the string `s`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `left` and `right` such that they satisfy all three conditions. Given that `left` is already defined as the index of the first '1' or the length of `s`, we need to ensure `right` is appropriately set.

### Adjusted State:
- `left` should remain as it is (either the index of the first '1' or the length of `s`).
- `right` should be adjusted to a value that satisfies `left <= right` and `right < len(s)`.

Since `left` is either the index of the first '1' or the length of `s`, `right` should be at least `left` and less than the length of `s`. Therefore, we can set `right` to `left` if `left` is less than the length of `s`.

State: **`left` will be the index of the first '1' in `s` or the length of `s` if there are no '1's, and `right` will be equal to `left` if `left` is less than the length of `s`**
