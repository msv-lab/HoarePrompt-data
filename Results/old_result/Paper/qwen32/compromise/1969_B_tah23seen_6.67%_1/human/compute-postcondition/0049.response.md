The given code snippet swaps the characters at indices `left` and `right` in the string `s`. Since strings in Python are immutable, the operation does not directly modify `s` but rather creates a new string with the swapped characters. However, for the purpose of this task, we'll consider the effect on the indices and the implied modification of `s`.

Given the initial state:
- `left` is the index of the next '1' in `s` starting from its current position, or the length of `s` if no '1' is found.
- `right` remains unchanged.
- `s` remains unchanged.

After executing the line `s[right], s[left] = s[left], s[right]`, the characters at positions `left` and `right` in `s` are swapped. The values of `left` and `right` themselves remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`left` is the index of the next '1' in `s` starting from its current position, or the length of `s` if no '1' is found, ensuring `left` is less than `len(s)` and `left <= right`; `right` remains unchanged; `s` has the characters at indices `left` and `right` swapped.**
