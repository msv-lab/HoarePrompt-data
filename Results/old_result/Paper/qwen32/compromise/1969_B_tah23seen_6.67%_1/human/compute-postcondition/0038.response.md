To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

The `while` loop condition is:
```
while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
```

This means the loop will continue as long as:
1. `right` is less than the length of the string `s`.
2. The character at index `right` in the string `s` is not '0'.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s`.
- `right` is `left + 2`.
- `s[right]` is '1'.
- `s` must have at least two characters starting from the first '1'.

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop head must still be true:
1. `right < len(s)` must hold true.
2. `s[right] != '0'` must hold true.

Since `s[right]` is currently '1', the second condition is already satisfied. Therefore, we only need to ensure that the first condition (`right < len(s)`) remains true.

Given that `right` is `left + 2`, and `left` is the index of the first '1', we need to ensure that there are enough characters in `s` such that `right` (which is `left + 2`) is still a valid index within the string `s`.

Thus, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `len(s)` is greater than `right` (which is `left + 2`).

State: **`left` is the index of the first '1' in `s`; `right` is `left + 2`; `s[right]` is '1'; `s` must have at least `right + 1` characters**
