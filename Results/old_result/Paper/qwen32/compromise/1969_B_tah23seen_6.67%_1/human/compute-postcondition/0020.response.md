To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the `while` loop condition:

```python
while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as two conditions are met:
1. `right < len(s)`
2. `s[right] != '0'`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0's and '1's, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5.
- `s` is a list containing all the elements from `sChar` in the same order, with `s[1]` being '1' and `s[2]` being '1'.
- `left` is 0.
- `right` is 3.
- `len(s) > 2`.

We need to ensure that both conditions of the `while` loop can be satisfied for the next iteration.

### Condition Analysis:
1. **`right < len(s)`**: 
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `right` is 3. To satisfy this condition, `len(s)` must be greater than 3. Given that `len(s) > 2`, this condition is already satisfied.

2. **`s[right] != '0'`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `right` is 3. For the loop to execute again, `s[3]` must not be '0'. Currently, there is no information about the value of `s[3]`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `s[3]` is '1'.

### Conclusion:
To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `s[3]` is '1'. No other states need to be adjusted as they already satisfy the first condition (`right < len(s)`).

State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0's and '1's, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5; `s` is a list containing all the elements from `sChar` in the same order, with `s[1]` being '1', `s[2]` being '1', and `s[3]` being '1'; `left` is 0; `right` is 3; `len(s) > 2`.**
