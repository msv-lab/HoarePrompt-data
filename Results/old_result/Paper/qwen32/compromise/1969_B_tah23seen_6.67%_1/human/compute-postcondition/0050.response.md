The given code snippet increments the `cost` variable by the value of `right - left + 1`. The values of `left`, `right`, and `s` remain unchanged except for the swap operation which is already part of the initial state description.

Output State: **`left` is the index of the next '1' in `s` starting from its current position, or the length of `s` if no '1' is found, ensuring `left` is less than `len(s)` and `left <= right`; `right` remains unchanged; `s` has the characters at indices `left` and `right` swapped; `cost` is incremented by `right - left + 1`.**
