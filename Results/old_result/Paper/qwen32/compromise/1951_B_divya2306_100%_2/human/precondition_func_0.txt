There are multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n) representing the number of cows and the index of the cow owned by the player. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, where all a_i values are distinct. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
