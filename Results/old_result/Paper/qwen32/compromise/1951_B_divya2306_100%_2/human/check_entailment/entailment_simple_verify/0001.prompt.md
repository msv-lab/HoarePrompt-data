You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n) representing the number of cows and the index of the cow owned by the player.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Initial Tournament Setup:**
   - There are `n` cows with distinct Cowdeforces ratings.
   - The tournament consists of `n-1` matches.
   - The first match is between cows in positions 1 and 2.
   - Subsequent matches are between the winner of the previous match and the cow in the next position.
   - The cow with the higher rating wins each match and proceeds to the next match.

2. **Objective:**
   - You want to maximize the number of wins for cow `k`.
   - You can swap cow `k` with another cow exactly once or do nothing.

3. **Approach:**
   - Determine the maximum number of wins cow `k` can achieve without any swap.
   - Determine the maximum number of wins cow `k` can achieve with an optimal swap.
   - Output the maximum of the two.

### Analysis of the Provided Program
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of cows) and `k` (index of cow to optimize).
   - It then reads the list of Cowdeforces ratings `a`.

2. **No Swap Case:**
   - The program initializes `wins` to 0.
   - It iterates through the list of ratings starting from the first cow.
   - It increments `wins` for each cow with a rating less than or equal to the rating of cow `k`.
   - If a cow with a higher rating is encountered, the loop breaks.
   - If `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints `wins - 1` (since cow `k` cannot win against itself).
   - Otherwise, it proceeds to the swap case.

3. **Swap Case:**
   - The program calculates `win_with_swap` as `wins + 1` (assuming an optimal swap).
   - It then iterates through the list of ratings starting from the position after the last win without swap.
   - It increments `win_with_swap` for each cow with a rating less than or equal to the rating of cow `k`.
   - If a cow with a higher rating is encountered, the loop breaks.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum of `wins - 1` and `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)`.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Logic for Swap Case:**
   - The swap logic seems incorrect. The program assumes that the optimal swap position is immediately after the last win without swap, which is not necessarily true.
   - The program does not consider all possible positions for the swap to maximize wins.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle all edge cases correctly, such as when cow `k` is already in the best possible position or when the optimal swap position is not immediately after the last win without swap.

### Conclusion
Given the issues in the swap logic and the handling of edge cases, the provided program is incorrect.
