You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

- Program: 
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each of the t test cases, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, x is the integer value of x from the last iteration of the loop, and y is the integer value of y from the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y`. For each test case, the function prints the two integers in non-decreasing order.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The given program is supposed to read multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers, and then output the minimum and maximum of those two integers for each test case. However, there is a logical error in the provided program. The program currently prints the larger number first and the smaller number second in the `if` and `else` clauses. This is the opposite of what is required according to the problem description.

The correct approach should be:
- For each test case, read the two integers.
- Compare the two integers.
- Print the smaller integer first, followed by the larger integer.

The current implementation does the following:
- For each test case, read the two integers.
- Compare the two integers.
- If the first integer is larger, print the first integer first, followed by the second integer.
- Otherwise, print the second integer first, followed by the first integer.

This results in the outputs being reversed compared to what is required.

Correctness: **False**
