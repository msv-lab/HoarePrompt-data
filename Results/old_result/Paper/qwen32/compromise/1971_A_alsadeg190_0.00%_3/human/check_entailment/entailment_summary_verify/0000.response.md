### Reasoning:
The provided program logic is incorrect as per the problem description. The program is supposed to output the minimum of two integers followed by the maximum of the two integers for each test case. However, the current implementation does the opposite. Specifically, the `if` statement in the program checks if `x > y` and then prints `x y`, which is incorrect. It should print `y x` in this case. Conversely, if `x <= y`, it prints `y x`, which is also incorrect because it should print `x y`.

The function summary provided does not reflect the actual behavior of the program. The function summary states that the function prints the two integers in non-decreasing order, which is not true based on the provided code.

The original assessment correctly identifies the issue with the program and provides a corrected version of the program. The original assessment is accurate in its evaluation.

### Final:
**False**
