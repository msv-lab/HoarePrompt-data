The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `x`. This means `x` will take on the integer value provided by the user input. The values of `t` and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, x is the integer value of the user input, and y is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9.**
