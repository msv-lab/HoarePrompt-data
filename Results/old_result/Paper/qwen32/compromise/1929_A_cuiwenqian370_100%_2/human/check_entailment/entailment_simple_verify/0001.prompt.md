You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

#Function 1:

def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0

    return beauty
    #The program returns the beauty, which is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

        index += n
        
        result = func_1(array)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: - After all iterations, `index` will have been incremented by `1` for each iteration (to get `n`), and by `n` for each iteration (to get the `array` elements). Therefore, `index` will be `1 + 2 * t + sum(n_i)`, where `n_i` is the value of `n` in the `i-th` iteration.
    #   - `results` will contain `t` elements, each element being the result of `func_1(array)` for the respective `array` in each iteration.
    #   - `array` will hold the last `array` that was processed in the loop.
    #   - `t` and `data` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
    #
    #Given that `func_1(array)` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact values of the `results` list. However, we can describe the state of the variables as follows:
    #
    #Output State:
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `index` will be `1 + 2 * t + sum(n_i)`, where `n_i` is the value of `n` in the `i-th` iteration. `results` will contain `t` elements, each element being the result of `func_1(array)` for the respective `array` in each iteration. `array` will hold the last `array` that was processed in the loop. `t` and `data` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The loop provided (`for result in results: print(result)`) will print each element in the `results` list, but this does not change the state of the variables.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires maximizing the beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array in any way. The beauty can be maximized by arranging the array in either ascending or descending order. This is because the absolute differences will be maximized when the elements are as far apart as possible, which happens in a sorted array (either ascending or descending).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(array)`**:
   - This function sorts the input array.
   - It initializes a variable `beauty` to 0.
   - It iterates over the sorted array starting from the second element, and for each element, it adds the absolute difference between the current element and the previous one to `beauty`.
   - Finally, it returns the computed `beauty`.
   
   **Reasoning**: Sorting the array and summing up the consecutive differences is a valid approach to compute the maximum beauty. Since the array is sorted, the absolute differences are maximized.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, which includes the number of test cases and the elements of each array.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements.
   - It calls `func_1(array)` to compute the maximum beauty of the array.
   - It stores the result and prints it after processing all test cases.

   **Reasoning**: This function correctly handles multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to compute the maximum beauty for each array. It reads the input correctly and outputs the results as required.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and computing the sum of consecutive differences. It handles multiple test cases and processes the input/output as specified in the problem description.
