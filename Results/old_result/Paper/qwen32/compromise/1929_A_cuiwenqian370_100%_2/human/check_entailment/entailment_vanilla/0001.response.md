Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires maximizing the beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array in any way. The beauty can be maximized by arranging the array in either ascending or descending order. This is because the absolute differences will be maximized when the elements are as far apart as possible, which happens in a sorted array (either ascending or descending).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(array)`**:
   - This function sorts the input array.
   - It initializes a variable `beauty` to 0.
   - It iterates over the sorted array starting from the second element, and for each element, it adds the absolute difference between the current element and the previous one to `beauty`.
   - Finally, it returns the computed `beauty`.
   
   **Reasoning**: Sorting the array and summing up the consecutive differences is a valid approach to compute the maximum beauty. Since the array is sorted, the absolute differences are maximized.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, which includes the number of test cases and the elements of each array.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements.
   - It calls `func_1(array)` to compute the maximum beauty of the array.
   - It stores the result and prints it after processing all test cases.

   **Reasoning**: This function correctly handles multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to compute the maximum beauty for each array. It reads the input correctly and outputs the results as required.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and computing the sum of consecutive differences. It handles multiple test cases and processes the input/output as specified in the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
