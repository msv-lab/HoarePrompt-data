### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem states that the beauty of an array is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. To maximize this beauty, the array should be arranged in either ascending or descending order. This is because sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(array)`**:
   - The function sorts the input array.
   - It initializes a variable `beauty` to 0.
   - It iterates over the sorted array starting from the second element, and for each element, it adds the absolute difference between the current element and the previous one to `beauty`.
   - Finally, it returns the computed `beauty`.

   **Reasoning**: Sorting the array and summing up the consecutive differences is a valid approach to compute the maximum beauty. Since the array is sorted, the absolute differences are maximized. However, since the array is sorted in ascending order, the absolute differences are simply the differences between consecutive elements (no need to use `abs` because the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order).

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, which includes the number of test cases and the elements of each array.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements.
   - It calls `func_1(array)` to compute the maximum beauty of the array.
   - It stores the result and prints it after processing all test cases.

   **Reasoning**: This function correctly handles multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to compute the maximum beauty for each array. It reads the input correctly and outputs the results as required.

#### Verification with Function Summary:
The function summary for `func_2` states that it reads input from standard input, processes each test case using an undefined function `func_1`, and prints the result. This matches the description of `func_2` in the code.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and computing the sum of consecutive differences. It handles multiple test cases and processes the input/output as specified in the problem description. The use of `abs` in `func_1` is unnecessary but does not affect the correctness of the program since the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

**Correctness: True**

Final: **True**
