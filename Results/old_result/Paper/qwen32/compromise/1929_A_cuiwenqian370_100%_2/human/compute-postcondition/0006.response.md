To determine the output state after the loop finishes executing, let's break down the loop's behavior step-by-step:

1. **Initial State Recap:**
   - `array` is a list of integers with length `n` (2 <= n <= 100), and each integer `a_i` in `array` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.
   - `data` is a list of strings, where each string is one of the integers from the input.
   - `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data`.
   - `index` is 1.
   - `results` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs `t` times.
   - In each iteration:
     - `n` is set to the integer value of `data[index]`.
     - `index` is incremented by 1.
     - `array` is set to a list of integers derived from the next `n` elements in `data` starting from `index`.
     - `index` is incremented by `n`.
     - `result` is computed by calling `func_1(array)`.
     - `result` is appended to the `results` list.

3. **Output State:**
   - After all iterations, `index` will have been incremented by `1` for each iteration (to get `n`), and by `n` for each iteration (to get the `array` elements). Therefore, `index` will be `1 + 2 * t + sum(n_i)`, where `n_i` is the value of `n` in the `i-th` iteration.
   - `results` will contain `t` elements, each element being the result of `func_1(array)` for the respective `array` in each iteration.
   - `array` will hold the last `array` that was processed in the loop.
   - `t` and `data` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Given that `func_1(array)` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact values of the `results` list. However, we can describe the state of the variables as follows:

Output State: **`array` is the last list of integers processed in the loop, `data` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `index` is `1 + 2 * t + sum(n_i)` where `n_i` is the value of `n` in the `i-th` iteration, and `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each the result of `func_1(array)` for the respective `array` in each iteration.**
