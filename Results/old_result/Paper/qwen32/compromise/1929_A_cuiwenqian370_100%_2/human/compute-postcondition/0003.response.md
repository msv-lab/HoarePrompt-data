Output State: **`array` is a list of integers with length n (2 <= n <= 100), and each integer a_i in array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `data` is a list of strings, where each string is one of the integers from the input; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data`; `index` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `index` is set to 1. The other variables (`array`, `data`, and `t`) remain unchanged.
