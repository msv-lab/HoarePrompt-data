Output State: **`array` is a list of integers with length n (2 <= n <= 100), and each integer a_i in array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `data` is a list of strings, where each string is one of the integers from the input; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data`.**

In simple terms, the value of `t` is now the integer value of the first string in the `data` list, while the `array` and the rest of the `data` list remain unchanged.
