The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was some value, and `n` must be greater than 1.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, as the loop increments `i` in each iteration.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value (let's call it `i_prev`).
2. The loop increments `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration.
3. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.
4. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i_prev + 1`. However, since we are asked to provide a general state, we can denote it as `i` being incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such input was received), `v2` is `n-1`, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `r` is the user input, `prev` is determined based on the user input conditions, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

For a more concrete example, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3. However, without the specific value of `i`, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such input was received), `v2` is `n-1`, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `r` is the user input, `prev` is determined based on the user input conditions, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

Given the loop structure and the requirement to only adjust the loop head variables, we can simplify it to:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.
