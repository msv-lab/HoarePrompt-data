Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `r` is the value of `input()`. If `r` equals `>`, `prev` is equal to the incremented value of `i`. If `r` equals `=`, `r2` is the value of the new input, and if `r2` equals `<`, `prev` is set to the previous value of `i`.**
