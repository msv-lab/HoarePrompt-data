The `sys.stdout.flush()` function is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that all output is written to the console immediately. However, it does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Given that none of the variables `n`, `g`, `v1`, `r`, `prev`, or `i` are modified by the `sys.stdout.flush()` function, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, `r` remains unchanged, `prev` is determined based on the conditions given, `i` is `v1 + 1`**.
