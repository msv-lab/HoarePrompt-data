The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change the values of any variables; it simply flushes the output buffer. Therefore, the values of `n`, `g`, `v1`, `prev`, `kp`, and `v2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `prev` is the largest `i` for which the user input was `'>'` or `'='` and the subsequent comparison with `prev` resulted in `'<'`, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `v2` is `i`.**
