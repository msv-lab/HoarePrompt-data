The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `v2`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `v2` will be updated to 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1` if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'>'` or `'='` followed by `'<'`, `v2` is 1, `i` is 1, `r` is the user's input.**
