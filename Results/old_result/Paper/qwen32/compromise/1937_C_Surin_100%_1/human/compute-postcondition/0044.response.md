Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`. If `r` is `'='`, then `prev` is set to the largest integer `i` for which the user's response was `'<'` if `r2` is `'<'`, otherwise `prev` remains 0. `r` remains `'='`.**
