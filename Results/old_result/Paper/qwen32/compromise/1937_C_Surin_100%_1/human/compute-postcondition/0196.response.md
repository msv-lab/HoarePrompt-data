`prev` is assigned the value of `i`. The values of `n`, `i`, `r`, and `r2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `r` is the value of `input()`, `r2` is the value of the new input, and `prev` is equal to the previous value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `r` is the value of `input()`, `r2` is the value of the new input, `prev` is equal to the previous value of `i`.**
