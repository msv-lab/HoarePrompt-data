The code snippet `v2 = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `v2`. Given that `i` is `n-1` from the initial state, `v2` will now be equal to `n-1`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'>'` or `'='` followed by `'<'`, `v2` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`**.
