To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State:
1. `n > i + 1`: This tells us that `n` is greater than `i + 1`, but it does not give us the exact values of `n` and `i`.
2. `i = i + 1`: This means that `i` is being incremented by 1.
3. `v2 = i`: This means that `v2` is assigned the value of `i`.

### Variables:
- `v1` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we don't have any information about its value. Therefore, we will represent it as `v1` in the output.
- `v2` is explicitly set to the value of `i` after `i` has been incremented.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial `i`**: Let's assume the initial value of `i` is some integer `x`.
2. **Increment `i`**: After the operation `i = i + 1`, `i` becomes `x + 1`.
3. **Set `v2`**: `v2` is then set to the new value of `i`, so `v2` is `x + 1`.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Output Analysis:
- The first `{v1}` and the second `{v1}` in the formatted string will both be the value of `v1` (which is unknown from the given information).
- The first `{v2}` and the second `{v2}` in the formatted string will both be the value of `v2`, which is `i` after it has been incremented by 1. Since `i` was initially `x`, now `v2` is `x + 1`.

### Final Output:
Given that we don't have the exact value of `v1`, we will represent it as `v1` in the output. The value of `v2` is `i + 1`.

Output: **? v1 v1 i+1 i+1 (where v1 is an unknown value and i+1 is the value of i after being incremented by 1)**
