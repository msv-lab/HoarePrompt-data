The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, but it does not affect the values of any variables in the program. Therefore, the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 and `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value still holds.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.
