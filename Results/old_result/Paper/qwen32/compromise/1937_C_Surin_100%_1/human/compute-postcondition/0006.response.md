In the provided for loop, the loop will iterate from `1` to `n-1`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Given the state before the loop starts, the key variable to ensure the loop executes is `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` is the loop variable and is initialized to `1` at the start of the loop. We do not need to adjust its state before the loop starts because it is set by the `range` function.
2. **Variable `n`**: The variable `n` determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than `1` (since the range is from `1` to `n-1`).

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than `1`. The other variables (`g` and `v1`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0**
