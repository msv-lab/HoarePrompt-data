The code snippet provided is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This command flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all output is written to the standard output immediately. However, it does not change the values of any variables.

Therefore, the values of `n`, `g`, `v1`, `r`, `prev`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, `r` is the user's input, `prev` is `v1 + 1`, `i` is `v1 + 2`.**
