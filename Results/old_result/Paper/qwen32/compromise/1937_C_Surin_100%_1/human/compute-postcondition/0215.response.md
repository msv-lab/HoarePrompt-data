Output State: **`kp` is equal to the total number of test cases, `n` is the integer input for the last test case, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'` during the last test case, and `prev` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'>'` or `'='` followed by `'<'` during the last test case.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `kp` will reflect the total number of test cases processed. For the last test case, `n` will be the number of elements, `v1` will be the index of the element that is the second largest, and `prev` will be the index of the largest element. The variable `g` remains 0 throughout the process.
