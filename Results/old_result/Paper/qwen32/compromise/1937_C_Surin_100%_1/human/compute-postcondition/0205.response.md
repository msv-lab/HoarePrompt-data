Let's break down the given code snippet and initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is greater than `i + 1`.
2. `i` is incremented by 1.
3. `r` is the value of user input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

### Analysis:
- **`i`**: The initial state mentions that `i` is incremented by 1. So, the value of `i` at the time of the print statement is `i + 1`.
- **`prev`**: The variable `prev` is not mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, we do not have an explicit value for `prev`. However, based on typical programming contexts, `prev` might be a variable that holds a previous value, possibly related to a loop or sequence. Since its value is not provided, we will denote it as `prev`.

### Output:
The print statement formats a string with the values of `i`, `i`, `prev`, and `prev`. Since `i` is incremented by 1, the first two placeholders will have the same value (`i + 1`), and the last two placeholders will have the value of `prev`.

Output: **? [i + 1] [i + 1] [prev] [prev] (where [i + 1] is the value of i after it has been incremented by 1, and [prev] is the value of the variable prev)**
