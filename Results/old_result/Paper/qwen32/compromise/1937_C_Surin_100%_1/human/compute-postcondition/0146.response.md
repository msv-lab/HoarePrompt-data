The code snippet provided only affects the variable `g`, setting it to `0`. The other variables (`n`, `v1`, `prev`, and `kp`) are not modified by this code.

Output State: **`n` is the new integer input by the user, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, `prev` is the largest `i` for which the user input was `'>'` or `'='` and the subsequent comparison with `prev` resulted in `'<'`, `kp` is `kp + 1`**.
