The code assigns the value of `i` to `v2`. The values of `n`, `g`, and `v1` remain unchanged. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we can only state that `v2` is now equal to whatever value `i` holds.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is equal to `i`**.
