The code snippet provided updates the value of the variable `prev` to be equal to the current value of `i`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, `r` is the user's input, `prev` is `v1 + 2`, `i` is `v1 + 2`, `r2` is the user's new input.**

In simple terms, the value of `prev` has been updated to be the same as `i`, which is `v1 + 2`. All other variables retain their initial values.
