Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`.
- `prev` is 0.
- `r` is the user's input, `r` is not `'>'`, and `r` is `'='`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**:
   - The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state provided. However, based on the context and the format of the print statement, it seems that `i` is intended to be the value of `v1` because `v1` is the largest integer `i` for which the user's response was `'<'`.
   - Therefore, we can assume `i = v1`.

2. **Variable `prev`**:
   - The variable `prev` is explicitly stated to be 0 in the initial state.

3. **User's Input `r`**:
   - The user's input `r` is stated to be `'='`. However, this does not directly affect the print statement since `i` and `prev` are the only variables being printed.

### Substituting Values:
- Since `i = v1` and `prev = 0`, the print statement will output:
  ```python
  print(f'? {v1} {v1} 0 0')
  ```

### Output:
The print statement will output the value of `v1` twice followed by 0 twice.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [v1] [v1] 0 0 (where v1 is the largest integer i from 1 to n-1 for which the user's response was '<')**
