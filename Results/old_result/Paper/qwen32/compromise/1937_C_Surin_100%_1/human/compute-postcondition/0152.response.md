The code provided takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `r`. None of the other variables (`n`, `g`, `v1`, `prev`, `kp`, `v2`) are modified by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `prev` is the largest `i` for which the user input was `'>'` or `'='` and the subsequent comparison with `prev` resulted in `'<'`, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `v2` is `i`, `r` is an input string.**
