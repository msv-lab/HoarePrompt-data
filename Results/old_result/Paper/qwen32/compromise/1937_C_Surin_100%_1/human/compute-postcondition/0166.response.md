The code snippet provided is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call does not change the values of any variables; it simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the standard output immediately. Therefore, the values of `n`, `i`, and `v2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is the value it had at the end of the last iteration plus 2, `v2` is equal to `i`.**
