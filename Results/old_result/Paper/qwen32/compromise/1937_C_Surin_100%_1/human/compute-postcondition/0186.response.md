Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such input was received), `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `i` if `r` was `'<'` and `r2` is `'<'`, otherwise `prev` remains unchanged, `kp` is `kp + 1`, and `r` is `'='`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts. Since there is no else part, the state remains unchanged except when `r` is `'='`, in which case `prev` is updated based on the previous input `r2`.
