The code snippet `n = int(input())` prompts the user to input a value, which is then converted to an integer and assigned to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` was a positive integer greater than 1, but this value is overwritten by the user's input. The other variables (`g`, `v1`, `prev`, and `kp`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value provided by the user's input, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, `prev` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'>'` or `'='` followed by `'<'`, `kp` is incremented by 1.**
