The code provided reads the number of test cases, `n`, and then for each test case, it reads an integer `l`, computes a value `s` based on `l`, and prints `s`. The value of `s` is computed as `(l//4) + (l - (4*(l//4)))//2`. The variable `n` is decremented by 1 after each test case is processed. 

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `x_i`, and `y_i` which represent the number of test cases and the coordinates of the corners of the square, respectively, are not directly affected by the code snippet provided. The code only processes `n` test cases and computes `s` for each test case.

The output state will reflect the decrement of `n` and the computation of `s` for each test case. Since the specific values of `l` are not provided, we can only describe the general form of the output state.

Output State: **Each test case consists of four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) where -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The number of test cases, `t`, satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. `n` is decremented by the number of test cases processed. For each test case, the value of `s` is computed as `(l//4) + (l - (4*(l//4)))//2` and printed.**
