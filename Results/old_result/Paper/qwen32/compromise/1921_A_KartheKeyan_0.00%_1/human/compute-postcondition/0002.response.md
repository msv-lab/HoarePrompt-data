To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to ensure that the condition `n` (which is the number of test cases left to process) is truthy. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered truthy, and zero is considered falsy. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given the state right before the `while` loop:
- `n` is an input integer.
- Each test case consists of four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.
- `n` is decremented by the number of test cases processed.

Since the loop condition is simply `while n:`, we only need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 right before the loop starts.

### Step-by-step reasoning:
1. **Identify the condition**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is truthy (i.e., `n > 0`).
2. **Adjust the state**: Since `n` is an input integer, we need to ensure that it is greater than 0 right before the loop starts.

### Conclusion:
To make sure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the state so that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
