Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `coord` is a list containing three tuples `[(p1, p2), (x, y), (x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 4**.

Natural language: The list `coord` now contains three tuples, with the last tuple being the newly appended `(x, y)`. The values of `n`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged.
