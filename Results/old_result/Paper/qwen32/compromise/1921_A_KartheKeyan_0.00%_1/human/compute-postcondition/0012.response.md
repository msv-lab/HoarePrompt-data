The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `x` and `y` based on the new input provided. Given that `x` and `y` are now updated to the first and second integers from the input respectively, the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is `[(x, y), (x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `y` is the second integer from the new input.**

In natural language: The values of `n`, `coord`, `res`, and `i` remain the same. The values of `x` and `y` are updated to the first and second integers from the new input, respectively.
