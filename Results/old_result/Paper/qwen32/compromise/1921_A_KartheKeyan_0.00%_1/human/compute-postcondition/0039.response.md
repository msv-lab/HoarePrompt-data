Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `coord` is `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]` sorted in ascending order first by x-coordinates and then by y-coordinates, `res` is `sqrt((x2 - x1) * (x4 - x3))`, `i` is `3`, `x` is the first integer from the last input, `y` is the second integer from the last input, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**

Natural Language: The value of `n` has been decremented by 1, so it is now at least 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
