Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect. The issue lies in the calculation of the area of the square. The program calculates the product of the lengths of two adjacent sides of the square, but it does so by taking the square root of the squared distances and then multiplying them, which is unnecessary and incorrect. Instead, it should simply calculate the squared distance between two adjacent points and use that as the area.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        coord = sorted(coord)
        # Calculate the squared distance between two adjacent points
        p1 = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2
        # Since the sides are parallel to the axes, we can use this distance as the side length squared
        res = p1
        print(res)
        n -= 1

func()
```

This corrected version calculates the squared distance between two adjacent points and uses that as the area of the square, which is correct.
