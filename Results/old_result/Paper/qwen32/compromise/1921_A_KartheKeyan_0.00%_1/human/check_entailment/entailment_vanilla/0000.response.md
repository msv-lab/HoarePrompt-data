Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
We need to find the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners. The square is aligned with the coordinate axes, which means its sides are either vertical or horizontal.

### Key Points
1. **Square Properties**:
   - All sides are equal.
   - The diagonals are equal and bisect each other at right angles.

2. **Input**:
   - We have `t` test cases.
   - Each test case consists of four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the square's corners.

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output the area of the square.

### Solution Analysis
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Reading the number of test cases `n`.
2. For each test case:
   - Reading the four coordinates.
   - Sorting these coordinates.
   - Calculating the squared distance between two consecutive points (assuming these points form a side of the square).
   - Calculating the area by taking the square root of the squared distance and multiplying it by itself (which is redundant as it just returns the squared distance).

### Issues in the Solution
1. **Sorting the Coordinates**:
   - Simply sorting the coordinates does not guarantee that the points are in the correct order to form the sides of the square.
   - For example, if the coordinates are (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), and (4, 2), sorting them will not necessarily give us the correct pairs of points representing the sides.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Area**:
   - The solution calculates the squared distance between two consecutive points and then takes the square root of that distance, which is correct for finding the side length.
   - However, it multiplies the square root of the distance by itself, which is redundant and incorrect in this context (it should just square the distance).

3. **Diagonal Calculation**:
   - Instead of calculating the distance between consecutive points, the solution calculates the distance between the second and first points and the fourth and third points, which are not necessarily sides of the square.
   - It then multiplies these distances, which is incorrect for calculating the area of a square.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem:
1. Read the coordinates.
2. Calculate the squared distances between all pairs of points.
3. Identify the two smallest distances (these should be the sides of the square).
4. The area of the square is the square of the side length.

### Correctness
Given the issues in the provided solution, it is clear that the solution is incorrect.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
