You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if sortedPassword == password:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Annotated Code: 
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `digits` is a list containing all the digit characters from the password; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the password.
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
        
    #State: password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `digits` is a list containing all the digit characters from the password, sorted in non-decreasing order; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the password, sorted in non-decreasing order.
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if (sortedPassword == password) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` checks if a given password string, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, is already sorted such that all digits come before letters, both in non-decreasing order. It returns `True` if the password meets this condition; otherwise, it returns `False`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem requirements and the provided program to determine if the program correctly implements the solution.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Character Set**: The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. **Ordering of Characters**:
   - No digit should come after a letter. This implies that all letters should appear before any digits in the password.
   - All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the password length and the password string. It then calls the function `func_1(password)` to determine if the password is strong. Here is a step-by-step analysis of `func_1(password)`:

1. **Separation of Characters**:
   - It initializes two lists, `digits` and `letters`.
   - It iterates through each character in the password. If the character is a digit, it appends it to the `digits` list; otherwise, it appends it to the `letters` list.

2. **Sorting**:
   - It sorts both `digits` and `letters` lists.

3. **Validation**:
   - It iterates through the `digits` list and checks if they are in non-decreasing order. This check is redundant because the list is already sorted.
   - It then checks if the last digit is less than or equal to every letter in the `letters` list. This ensures that no digit comes after a letter in the original password.
   - Finally, it constructs a `sortedPassword` string by concatenating the sorted `digits` and `letters` lists and compares it to the original password. If they match, it means the original password was already sorted according to the rules, and the function returns `True`.

### Issues in the Provided Program:
- The program does not correctly handle the condition that no digit should come after a letter. The check `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:` is incorrect because it only compares the last digit with the first letter, not ensuring that no digit precedes any letter.
- The program does not correctly handle the case where the password contains only letters or only digits, as it would still attempt to access `digits[-1]` which would cause an error if `digits` is empty.

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly implement the solution, we need to ensure that:
- All letters appear before any digits.
- Digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- Letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    if digits and letters and password.index(digits[0]) < password.index(letters[-1]):
        return False
    return digits == sorted(digits) and letters == sorted(letters)
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above.

Correctness: **False**
