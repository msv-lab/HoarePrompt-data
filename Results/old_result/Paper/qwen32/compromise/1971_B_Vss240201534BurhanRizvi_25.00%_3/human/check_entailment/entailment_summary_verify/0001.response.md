### Reasoning:

The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem by generating a random permutation of the input string `s` and checking if this permutation is different from the original string `s`. If a different permutation is found, it outputs "YES" followed by the new string; otherwise, it outputs "NO". Let's evaluate the correctness of this approach based on the problem description and the function summary:

1. **Randomness and Efficiency**:
   - The program uses `random.sample(s, len(s))` to generate a random permutation of the string `s`. This method does not guarantee that a different permutation will be generated, especially for strings with many repeated characters.
   - For example, if the input string is "aaaaa", any random permutation will still be "aaaaa", and the program will output "NO" correctly. However, for strings like "codeforces", the chances of getting the same permutation by random chance are very low, and the program will likely output "YES" with a different string.

2. **Guaranteed Different Arrangement**:
   - The problem requires a guaranteed solution if one exists. Relying on randomness does not provide this guarantee. For strings with repeated characters, the program might incorrectly output "NO" due to the high probability of generating the same permutation.
   - For example, if the input string is "codeforces", the program is likely to find a different permutation and output "YES" correctly. However, if the input string is "aaaaa", the program correctly outputs "NO" because no different permutation is possible.

3. **Deterministic Solution**:
   - A more reliable and deterministic approach would be to systematically rearrange the string. For example, if the string length is greater than 1, swapping the first two characters will always produce a different string unless all characters are the same.
   - The current approach, while not deterministic, does work correctly in many cases due to the high probability of generating a different permutation for strings with distinct characters.

### Conclusion:

While the program relies on randomness and may not guarantee a correct solution in all cases, it does correctly handle the cases where a different permutation is possible. The original assessment correctly identifies the reliance on randomness as a potential issue but does not fully acknowledge that the program can still produce correct results for many inputs.

However, the problem explicitly requires a guaranteed solution, and relying on randomness does not meet this requirement. Therefore, the program does not guarantee a correct solution in all cases due to its reliance on randomness.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
