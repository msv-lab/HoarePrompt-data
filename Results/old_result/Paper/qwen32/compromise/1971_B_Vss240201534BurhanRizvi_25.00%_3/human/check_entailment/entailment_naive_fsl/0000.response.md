Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses the `random.sample` function to generate a random permutation of the input string `s`. While this approach might work for some test cases, it does not guarantee that a different string will always be produced, especially for strings with repeated characters or very short strings. 

For example, consider the input "aaaaa". The `random.sample` function will always return "aaaaa" because there is only one unique permutation of this string. Therefore, the condition `s != s2` will fail, and the program will incorrectly output "No" for this case, even though the correct output should be "YES" followed by the same string "aaaaa" (since all permutations are the same).

Another example is the input "d". Since there is only one character, any permutation of "d" is "d" itself, so the program will output "No", which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is therefore incorrect.
