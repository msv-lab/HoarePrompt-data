Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters. It then checks if a random permutation of the string `s` is different from `s` itself. If they are different, it outputs "Yes" followed by the permuted string; otherwise, it outputs "No". The value of `t` remains unchanged throughout the execution.**
