Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `data` is a list of strings, each representing an integer from the original input string, `idx` is 2, `results` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
