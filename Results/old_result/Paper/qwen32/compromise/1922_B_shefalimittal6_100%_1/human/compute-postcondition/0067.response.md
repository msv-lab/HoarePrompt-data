Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `data[1]` is a string representing an integer value of at least 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `data` is a list of strings with at least `n + 3` elements where `data[n + 2]` is a string representation of a positive integer, `idx` is `2n + 3`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements where each element is the count of the corresponding integer read from `data`, `cnt` is `0`, `ans` is `0`, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, and `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2.**
