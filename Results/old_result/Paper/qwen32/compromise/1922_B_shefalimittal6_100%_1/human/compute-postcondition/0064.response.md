Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `data[1]` is a string representing an integer value of at least 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is `2n + 3`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements where each element is the count of the corresponding integer read from `data`, `cnt` is `0`, `ans` is recalculated based on the final counts in `v`, `n` is a positive integer derived from `data[n + 2]`.**

In this output state, the only variable that has changed is `cnt`, which has been set to `0`. All other variables retain their initial values and states.
