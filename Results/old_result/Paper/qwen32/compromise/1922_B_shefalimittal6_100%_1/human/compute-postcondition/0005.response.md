The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `data`, `idx`) are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i <= n; `data` is a list of strings, each representing an integer from the original input string; `idx` is 1; `results` is an empty list.**
