The code snippet increments the value of `idx` by 1. Given that the initial value of `idx` is `2n + 4`, after the increment, `idx` will be `2n + 5`.

Here are the details of the output state:
- `t` remains 1.
- `data[1]` remains a string representing an integer value of at least 0.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remains a list of integers where 0 <= a_i <= n.
- `data` remains a list of strings with at least `n + 3` elements where `data[n + 2]` is a string representation of a positive integer.
- `idx` is now `2n + 5`.
- `results` remains a list containing the string representation of `ans` and the string representation of `ans` again.
- `v` remains a list of `n + 1` zeros.
- `cnt` remains `sum(v)`, which is 0.
- `ans` remains the accumulated sum from all iterations of the loop.
- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `i` remains `n`.
- `x` remains the integer value of `data[2n + 4]`.
