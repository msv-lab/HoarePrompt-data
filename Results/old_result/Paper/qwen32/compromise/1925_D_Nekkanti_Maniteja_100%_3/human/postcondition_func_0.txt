The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, representing the number of nodes, edges, and an additional parameter, respectively. For each test case, it also processes `m` lines of input, each containing three integers representing an edge between nodes and a weight. The function calculates and prints a specific value for each test case based on these inputs, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
