The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The initial state of these variables is not specified, but after the execution of the code, their values will be the integers provided by the input. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is `a + f`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are the integers read from the input, `i` is 4**.

In simple terms, the values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated to the integers read from the input, while all other variables retain their initial values.
