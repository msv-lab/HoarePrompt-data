The code snippet `a += f` increments the value of `a` by the value of `f`. Since it is given that `a` is already increased by `f` before the code snippet, the net effect of the code snippet is that `a` is increased by `f` again. Therefore, `a` is effectively increased by `2 * f`.

The values of `m`, `u`, `v`, and `f` remain unchanged. The precondition that `m` must be greater than 0 is still valid.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers read from the input; `a` is increased by `2 * f`; `i` is incremented by 1.**
