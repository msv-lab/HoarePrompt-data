To determine the final output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case. The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it calculates a value `s` based on the inputs `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of edges with their corresponding `f` values.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the computation for a single test case:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `M = 10 ** 9 + 7` (a large prime number used for modulo operations).
   - `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` (the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`).
   - `s = 0` (initialized sum).
   - `a = 0` (initialized sum of `f` values).

2. **Processing the edges**:
   - The loop reads `m` edges, each with two nodes `a_i` and `b_i` and a value `f_i`.
   - It accumulates the sum of all `f_i` values into `a`.

3. **Calculating `s`**:
   - The loop then performs `k` iterations, updating `s` using the formula:
     \[
     s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
     \]
     Simplifying, this becomes:
     \[
     s = s + c^2 * m * i + c * a
     \]
     where `i` ranges from `0` to `k-1`.

4. **Summing up the contributions**:
   - The sum of `c^2 * m * i` for `i` from `0` to `k-1` is:
     \[
     c^2 * m * \frac{(k-1) * k}{2}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total update to `s` for a single test case is:
     \[
     s = c^2 * m * \frac{(k-1) * k}{2} + c * a * k
     \]

5. **Final Output**:
   - The final value of `s` for each test case is printed modulo `M`.

Given that the loop executes `t` times, the final output state after all iterations will be the sum of the results of each individual test case.

**Output State: **The final output state after all iterations is the sum of `s` values for each of the `t` test cases, where each `s` is calculated as `c^2 * m * (k-1) * k // 2 + c * a * k` modulo `M`.**

In natural language, the output state after all iterations is the cumulative sum of the results from each test case, where each result is computed based on the formula derived above, and the final sum is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
