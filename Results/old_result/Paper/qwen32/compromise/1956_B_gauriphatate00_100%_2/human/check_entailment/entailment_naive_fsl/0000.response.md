Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. The function `func_1` simply counts the number of pairs of cards you have, which is not the optimal strategy for either player to maximize their score.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Optimal Play Strategy**: The problem requires both players to play optimally. Nene, being very smart, will always try to maximize her score and minimize yours. The given program does not simulate this optimal play strategy.

2. **Game Dynamics**: The program does not account for the alternating turns and the fact that both players can see the cards on the table. The optimal strategy involves considering the state of the table and the remaining cards in both players' hands.

3. **Example Case**: Consider the following test case:

   ```
   1
   4
   1 2 3 4
   ```

   In this case, the cards you have are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Nene has the other 1, 2, 3, and 4. If both play optimally, the game could proceed as follows:

   - You play 1. No points for either.
   - Nene plays 1. Nene gets 1 point.
   - You play 2. No points for either.
   - Nene plays 2. Nene gets 1 point.
   - You play 3. No points for either.
   - Nene plays 3. Nene gets 1 point.
   - You play 4. No points for either.
   - Nene plays 4. Nene gets 1 point.

   In this scenario, you get 0 points, and Nene gets 4 points. The program, however, would output 0, which is correct for this specific case but does not guarantee the optimal strategy for all cases.

4. **General Case**: The program fails to simulate the dynamic and interactive nature of the game. It only counts the pairs you have, which does not consider the strategic decisions made by Nene.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach involving game theory or dynamic programming would be required to simulate the optimal play strategy for both players.
