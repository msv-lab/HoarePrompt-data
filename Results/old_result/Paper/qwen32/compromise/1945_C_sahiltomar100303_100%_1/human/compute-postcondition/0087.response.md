The code snippet `tleftOne += 1` increments the value of the variable `tleftOne` by 1. Given that the initial state specifies `tleftOne` is 0, after the increment, `tleftOne` will be 1. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`left` will be 0; `right` is equal to `mid` (which is 1); `t`, `a`, `n` (which is 3), `s`, `mid` (which is 1), `tleftZero` (which is 0), `trightZero`, `tleftOne` (which is 1), `trightOne`, `leftMove` remain unchanged; and `s[right]` is not '0'**.
