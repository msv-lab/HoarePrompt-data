Output State: **`left` is `n // 2`; `right` is 3; `t` is 3; `a` is 3; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftMove` remains unchanged; `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`; `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`; `trightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`; `trightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `left` has been updated to `n // 2`, which is the value of `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
