Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `right` is 5, `t` is 2, `a` is 3, `n` is 8, `s` is "11001100", `mid` is 4, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 5, `rightOne` is 3. If the character at position `right` in `s` is '0', then `tleftZero` is 3 and `trightZero` is 4, `tleftOne` is 3 and `trightOne` is 2. Otherwise, `tleftZero` is 2 and `trightZero` is 1, `tleftOne` is 4 and `trightOne` is 1`.**
