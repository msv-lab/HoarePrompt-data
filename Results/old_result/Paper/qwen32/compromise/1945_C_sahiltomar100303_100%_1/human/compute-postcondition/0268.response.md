Postcondition: **left is 0, right is 3, t is 3, a is 3, n is 3, s is the input string, mid is 1, leftMove is 0, leftZero is 0, tleftZero depends on s[1] and s[2], rightZero is 2, rightOne is 0, trightZero depends on s[1] and s[2], trightOne depends on s[1] and s[2], leftOne is 1, tleftOne depends on s[1] and s[2]. If right is not equal to n, then the condition right != n is true. If right is equal to n, then rightOne is either greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2 or less than (n + 1) // 2. If left is not 0, and right equals n, the values of the variables remain unchanged. If left is not 0 and right is not equal to n, the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and left is less than or equal to the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and right, or the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and left is greater than the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and right.**
