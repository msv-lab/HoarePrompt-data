Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `n` is at least 2, `s` is the value of the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2` (which means `mid` is at least 1), `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 1, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 1, `trightOne` is 0, and `s[i]` is not '0'.**

Explanation: The value of `tleftOne` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
