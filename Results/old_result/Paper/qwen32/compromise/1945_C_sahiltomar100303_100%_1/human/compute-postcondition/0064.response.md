Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `n` is a new input integer such that `n > 1`, `s` is the value of the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is -1 if the character at index `left - 1` in `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` (from index `mid` to `n-1`) plus 1 if the character at index `left - 1` in `s` is '0', otherwise it is the count of '0's in the second half of `s`, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `rightOne` is 1 if the character at index `left - 1` in `s` is '1', otherwise `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` (from index `mid` to `n-1`) plus 1 if the character at index `left - 1` in `s` is '0', otherwise it is the count of '0's in the second half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `trightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` (from index `mid` to `n-1`) minus 1 if the character at index `left - 1` in `s` is '1', otherwise it is the count of '1's in the second half of `s`, `left` is `n // 2`, and `leftMove` is 0.**
