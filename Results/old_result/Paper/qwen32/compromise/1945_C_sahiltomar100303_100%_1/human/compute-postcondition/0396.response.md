Postcondition: **`left` is not 0, `right` is 8, `t` is 2, `a` is 3, `n` is 8, `s` is "11001100", `mid` is 4, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `tleftZero` is 4, `rightZero` is 5, `rightOne` is 3, `trightZero` is 3, `trightOne` is 2, `leftOne` is 3, `tleftOne` is 3, and `right` is not equal to `n`**.

Since the program does not enter the if block, the condition `right == n` is false, meaning `right` is not equal to `n`. All other variable values and relationships remain unchanged as per the precondition.
