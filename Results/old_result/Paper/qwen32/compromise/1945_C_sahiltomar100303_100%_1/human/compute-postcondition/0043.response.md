Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `n` is a new input integer such that `n > 1`, `s` is the value of the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `i` is `mid + 1`, `rightZero` is 3 if `s[i]` is '0' else 1, `trightZero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0' else 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `rightZero` is incremented by 1. If `s[i]` was initially '0', then `rightZero` becomes 3 (since it was initially 2) and `trightZero` remains 1. If `s[i]` was not '0', then `rightZero` becomes 1 (since it was initially 0) and `trightZero` remains 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
