Postcondition: **`left` is 0 or 1, `right` is 3, `t` is 2, `a` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is the new input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftMove` is 0 or 1, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is '0', `leftMove` is 1 and `tleftZero` is `tleftZero + 1`. Otherwise, `left` is 1, `leftMove` is 0, and `tleftOne` is increased by 1.**
