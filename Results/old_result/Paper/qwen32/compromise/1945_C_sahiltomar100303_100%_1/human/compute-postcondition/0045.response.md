The code snippet provided increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated value of `rightOne` will be its previous value plus 1.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `n` is a new input integer such that `n > 1`, `s` is the value of the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `i` is `mid + 1`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is 2 and `trightZero` is 1. Otherwise, `rightZero` is 0 and `trightOne` is 1, `rightOne` is the previous value of `rightOne` plus 1.**
