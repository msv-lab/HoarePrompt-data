The value of `right` is incremented by 1, so `right` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is 0; `right` is 3; `t`, `a`, `n` is 3; `s`, `mid` is 1; `leftMove` remains unchanged; `s[right]` is not '0'. If `s[right]` is '0', `tleftZero` is 1 and `trightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is -1. Otherwise, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightOne` is -1, `tleftOne` is 1.

Output State: **`left` is 0; `right` is 3; `t`, `a`, `n` is 3; `s`, `mid` is 1; `leftMove` remains unchanged; `s[right]` is not '0'. If `s[right]` is '0', `tleftZero` is 1 and `trightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is -1. Otherwise, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightOne` is -1, `tleftOne` is 1.**
