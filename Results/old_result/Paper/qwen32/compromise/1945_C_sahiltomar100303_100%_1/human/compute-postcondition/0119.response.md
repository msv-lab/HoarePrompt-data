The `print(left)` statement will output the value of the variable `left`. According to the initial state provided, `left` is not 0, but its exact value is not explicitly stated. The only information given is that `left` is not equal to 0, and it is not further defined or modified in the provided code snippet.

Since we do not have the exact value of `left`, we can only state that it is a non-zero value.

Output: **left (where left is a non-zero value)**
