The code snippet `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Since `rightZero` was not defined in the initial state, we can infer that it is being initialized and incremented for the first time. Therefore, `rightZero` will be 1 after the execution of this line of code. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is 3, `t` is 2, `a` is 3, `n` is greater than 4, `s` is the new input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is 4, `rightZero` is 1**.
