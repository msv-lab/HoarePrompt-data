The code snippet `left -= 1` decrements the value of `left` by 1. Given the initial state where `left` is 1, after decrementing, `left` becomes 0.

The other variables remain unchanged as per the provided initial state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is 3, `t` is 3, `a` is 3, `n` is 3, `s` is the input string, `mid` is 1, `leftMove` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 2, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 1, `trightOne` is 0. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is -1. Otherwise, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 3, `rightOne` is 1, and `leftOne` is -1.**
