Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `right` is 8, `t` is 2, `a` is 3, `n` is 8, `s` is "11001100", `mid` is 4, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `tleftZero` is 4, `rightZero` is 5, `rightOne` is 3, `trightZero` is 3, `trightOne` is 2, `leftOne` is 3, `tleftOne` is 3`. Additionally, if `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, then `rightOne` is at least 5. Otherwise, `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2` (which is 4.5).**
