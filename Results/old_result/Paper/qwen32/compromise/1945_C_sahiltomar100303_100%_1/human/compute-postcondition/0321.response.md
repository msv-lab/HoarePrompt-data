Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `right` is 3 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `right` is 4, `t` is 2, `a` is 3, `n` is greater than 4, `s` is the new input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is 5. If `s[i]` is '0', `rightZero` is 3 and `trightOne` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is not '0'. Otherwise, `rightOne` is 2 and `rightZero` is 2.**
