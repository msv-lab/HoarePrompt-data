The code `leftOne += 1` increments the value of `leftOne` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `n` is at least 2, `s` is the value of the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `i` is 2, `leftZero` is 2 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 1, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is either 2 or 3 depending on whether `s[0]` is not '0', `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 2 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 1, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 2 if `s[0]` is not '0' otherwise 1, `trightOne` is 0.**
