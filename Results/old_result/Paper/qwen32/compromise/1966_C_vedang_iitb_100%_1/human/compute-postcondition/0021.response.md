Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `tc` is not yet defined (it seems to be irrelevant for this specific print statement).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.
- `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
- `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')
```

### Analysis:
- The code checks if `mexsize` (the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`) is odd (`mexsize % 2 == 1`).
- If `mexsize` is odd, it prints 'Alice'.
- If `mexsize` is even, it prints 'Bob'.

### Determining the Output:
- The value of `mexsize` depends on the contents of the list `a`.
- Since `a` is a sorted list of integers and `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in `a`, `mexsize` could be any positive integer starting from 1 upwards, skipping those already present in `a`.
- The parity (odd or even nature) of `mexsize` determines the output.

Given the information, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `mexsize` without knowing the specific contents of the list `a`. However, we can describe the output based on the parity of `mexsize`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Alice if mexsize is odd, otherwise Bob (where mexsize is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`)**
