Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must contain at least two elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `sz` is `a[1]`. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is updated to 3. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1.**
