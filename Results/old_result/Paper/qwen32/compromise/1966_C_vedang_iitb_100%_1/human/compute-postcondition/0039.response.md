To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variable `mexsize`. The loop iterates over each element `sz` in the sorted list `a`. If `sz` equals `mexsize`, `mexsize` is incremented by 1. This process continues until the loop has processed all elements in `a`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
   - `tc` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input.
   - `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.
   - `mexsize` is initialized to 1.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each element `sz` in `a`, the loop checks if `sz` equals `mexsize`.
   - If they are equal, `mexsize` is incremented by 1.
   - This continues until all elements in `a` have been processed.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop finishes, `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer that is not present in the list `a`. This is because the loop increments `mexsize` every time it finds the current `mexsize` in the list, effectively skipping over all present positive integers in ascending order.

Thus, the final state of `mexsize` will be the smallest missing positive integer in the sorted list `a`.

**Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer that does not appear in the sorted list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state or are not modified by the loop.
