Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. This represents the number of test cases but does not directly affect the current print statement.
- `tc` is set to 2, which also doesn't directly impact the current print statement.
- `n` is an input integer, representing the number of elements in the list `a`.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input.
- `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.
- `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
- It is explicitly stated that the current value of `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement evaluates the expression `'Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 0 else 'Bob'`. This means it checks if `mexsize` is even (i.e., `mexsize % 2 == 0`). If true, it prints "Alice"; otherwise, it prints "Bob".

### Given Condition:
- `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, and since `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`, it implies that all integers from 1 to `maxsize` are present in `a`.

### Determining `mexsize`:
Since `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in `a` and all integers from 1 to `maxsize` are present in `a`, `mexsize` must be the next integer after `maxsize`, i.e., `mexsize = maxsize + 1`.

### Parity of `mexsize`:
- If `maxsize` is odd, then `mexsize = maxsize + 1` is even.
- If `maxsize` is even, then `mexsize = maxsize + 1` is odd.

However, the specific parity of `maxsize` is not provided. But based on the given condition that `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize` and is the smallest positive integer not in `a`, we can conclude that `mexsize` could be either even or odd depending on the parity of `maxsize`.

### Conclusion:
Given that the problem states `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize` and is the smallest missing positive integer, we need to consider both possibilities. However, without loss of generality and based on the provided condition, we can infer the following:

- If `maxsize` is odd, `mexsize` is even, and the output will be "Alice".
- If `maxsize` is even, `mexsize` is odd, and the output will be "Bob".

Since the exact value of `maxsize` is not specified, we cannot definitively say whether `mexsize` is even or odd. However, the problem setup indicates that `mexsize` is always the next integer after `maxsize`, so the output depends on the parity of `maxsize`.

### Final Output:
Given the condition that `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize` and considering the parity of `maxsize`, the output will depend on whether `maxsize` is odd or even. However, based on the problem's setup, we can infer that the output will be determined by the parity of `mexsize`.

Since `mexsize` is described as being greater than `maxsize` and is the smallest missing positive integer, the output will be based on the parity of `mexsize`.

Thus, the output will be either "Alice" or "Bob" depending on the parity of `mexsize`.

To provide a precise answer based on the given information:

Output: **Alice if mexsize is even, Bob if mexsize is odd (where mexsize is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`)**

However, since the exact value of `mexsize` is not provided, we can only describe it based on the given conditions:

Output: **Alice if mexsize is even, Bob if mexsize is odd (where mexsize is the smallest positive integer greater than maxsize not present in the list `a`)**

Given the problem constraints and the setup, the most precise answer we can provide is:

Output: **Alice if mexsize is even, Bob if mexsize is odd**
