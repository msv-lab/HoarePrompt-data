To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the given for loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for tc in range(t):`, which means the variables `tc` and `t` are relevant.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `t`:** This variable determines how many times the loop will iterate. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be at least 1. Given the problem statement, `t` is already constrained to be within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, so no adjustment is needed for `t` itself to ensure the loop executes.

2. **Variable `tc`:** This variable is the loop variable that takes on values from 0 to `t-1`. Before the loop starts, `tc` does not need to be initialized because it is set automatically by the `range` function during each iteration. However, to describe the state before the loop starts, we can say that `tc` is not yet defined or is in an undefined state since it is about to be initialized by the loop.

Given these points, the state before the loop starts should reflect that `t` is within its valid range and `tc` is not yet defined. Since `t` is already guaranteed to be at least 1 by the problem constraints, the only thing we need to ensure is that `t` is correctly set within its specified range.

Therefore, the adjusted state before the loop starts is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `tc` is not yet defined**
