To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head contains the variable `sz` which iterates over the elements in the list `a`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `tc` is not yet defined
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element
- `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`
- `sz` is the next element in the list `a`
- If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is set to 2. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1.

Since `sz` is the variable being iterated over in the loop, we need to update `sz` to the next element in the list `a` for the next iteration to occur. The other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, and `mexsize`) are not directly controlled by the loop head and thus do not need to be modified for the loop to continue.

Let's assume that the current value of `sz` is `a[k]` (the k-th element of the list `a`). For the next iteration, `sz` should be `a[k+1]` (the (k+1)-th element of the list `a`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `t` remains the same
- `tc` remains undefined
- `n` remains the same
- `a` remains the same
- `maxsize` remains the same
- `sz` is updated to the next element in the list `a`
- `mexsize` remains unchanged unless the new `sz` equals the current `mexsize`

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `tc` is not yet defined, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `sz` is the next element in the list `a`, `mexsize` remains unchanged unless the new `sz` equals the current `mexsize`**

To be more precise, if `sz` was `a[k]` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `sz` becomes `a[k+1]` (assuming `k+1` is within the bounds of the list `a`).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `tc` is not yet defined, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `sz` is the next element in the list `a` (specifically, if `sz` was `a[k]` before, now `sz` is `a[k+1]`), `mexsize` remains unchanged unless the new `sz` equals the current `mexsize`**
