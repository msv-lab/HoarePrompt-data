Given the initial state, the code snippet `r += a[x]` modifies the string `r` by appending the string representation of `a[x]` to it.

Since `r` is initially the string representation of `a[x]`, after executing `r += a[x]`, `r` will be the concatenation of the string representation of `a[x]` with itself.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element, `r` is the string representation of `a[x]` concatenated with itself, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`, `b[x]` is incremented by 1, `i` is the last element in `s`.**
