a is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n), followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with all a_i's being distinct. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
