You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    k -= 1
    print(func_1(l))

def func_1(a):
    x = a[k]
    ind = []
    c = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > x:
            ind.append(i)
            c += 1
        if c == 2:
            break
    if ind == []:
        return n - 1
    if len(ind) == 1:
        if ind[0] == 0:
            return k - 1
        if ind[0] > k:
            return ind[0] - 1
        return max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)
    if ind[0] == 0:
        return min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)
    if k > ind[1]:
        return max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])
    return max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a list `a` that contains test cases. Each test case starts with two integers `n` and `k`, followed by `n` distinct integers representing Cowdeforces ratings. The function identifies the `k`-th element `x` in the list and finds the indices of the first two elements greater than `x`. Based on these indices, the function returns different values: `n - 1` if no elements greater than `x` are found, `k - 1` under specific conditions, or a calculated index based on the positions of the identified elements relative to `x`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of wins for cow k. The function `func_1` does not properly account for the optimal swap that cow k can make to maximize its wins.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Wins Without Swap**: The code calculates the number of wins for cow k without considering the optimal swap. The logic for counting wins is flawed because it doesn't correctly track the position of cow k and how it would affect the tournament outcome.
2. **Incorrect Handling of Swap**: The code attempts to handle the swap by identifying the first two cows with higher ratings than cow k. However, this logic is not sufficient to determine the optimal swap. The code does not consider the impact of swapping cow k with different cows and how it affects the subsequent matches.
3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The code does not handle edge cases where cow k is already in a position where it can win many matches or where swapping cow k with any other cow does not increase the number of wins.

Let's consider an example to demonstrate the issue:

**Example:**
```
Input:
1
5 2
10 20 15 25 30

Output:
1
```

**Explanation:**
- Cow k is initially in position 2 with a rating of 20.
- Without any swap, cow k will play against cow 1 (rating 10) and win.
- Then cow k will play against cow 3 (rating 15) and win.
- Then cow k will play against cow 4 (rating 25) and lose.
- Total wins without swap: 2.

**Optimal Swap:**
- If we swap cow k with cow 3 (rating 15), the new order will be: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.
- Cow k (rating 20) will play against cow 1 (rating 10) and win.
- Then cow k will play against cow 4 (rating 25) and lose.
- Total wins with swap: 1.

The code does not correctly determine that the optimal number of wins is 2 in this case. Instead, it might incorrectly calculate the number of wins based on the flawed logic.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
