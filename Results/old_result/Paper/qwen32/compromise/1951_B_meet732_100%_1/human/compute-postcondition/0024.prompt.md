You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: a is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n), followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with all a_i's being distinct. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
```
def func_1(a):
```
Output: Case_1: The program returns `n - 1`

Case_2: The program returns k - 1.

Case_3: The program returns an index that is one less than the first index in `ind`, which is greater than `k`.

Case_4: The program returns the maximum of (k - ind[0]) and (ind[0] - 1)

Case_5: The program returns the minimum value between `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`. Since `ind` is not an empty list and its length is not equal to 1, `ind[1]` exists and is an index of the second element in `a` that is greater than `x`. Given `ind[0]` is 0, `ind[1]` is at least 1, making `ind[1] - 1` a non-negative integer. `k` is the index of `x` in `a`, and `k - 1` is the index of the element before `x` in `a`. The return value is the smaller of these two calculated indices.

Case_6: The program returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`. Since `ind` contains the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, and `ind[0]` is not equal to 0, `ind[0] - 1` represents the number of elements before the first element greater than `x`, and `ind[1] - ind[0]` represents the number of elements between the first and second elements greater than `x`.

Case_7: The program returns the maximum of (`ind[0] - 1`) and (`k - ind[0]`)

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
In your response strictly use the format: Functionality: **the functionality you calculate.**, and describe this functionality in Natural language easily understandable by humans
