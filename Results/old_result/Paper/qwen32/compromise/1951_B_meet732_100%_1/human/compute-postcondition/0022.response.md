Postcondition: **`a` remains unchanged as it is only being read, not modified. `x` remains the k-th element of the list `a`. `ind` will contain the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, if such elements exist. If there are fewer than two such elements, `ind` will contain fewer than two indices. `c` will be either 0, 1, or 2, depending on how many elements greater than `x` were found before the loop broke. Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list, and the length of `ind` is not equal to 1. `ind[0]` is not equal to 0. `k` is less than or equal to `ind[1]`.**
