The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `cases`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these two variables. If `i` is less than `cases`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. The state of `arr`, `lex`, and `info` does not change based on the loop head variables.

Let's assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`arr` is sorted in ascending order and includes the element `lex`; `lex` is unchanged; `info` contains `arr` as its last element; `i` is `x + 1`, `cases` remains unchanged**.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can represent it as `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

For clarity, if we assume `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be 3.

State: **`arr` is sorted in ascending order and includes the element `lex`; `lex` is unchanged; `info` contains `arr` as its last element; `i` is 3, `cases` remains unchanged**

However, without knowing the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, the most accurate representation is:

State: **`arr` is sorted in ascending order and includes the element `lex`; `lex` is unchanged; `info` contains `arr` as its last element; `i` is `x + 1`, `cases` remains unchanged**
