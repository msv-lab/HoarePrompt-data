Output State: **`arr` is either `[1]`, `[26, 1]`, `[1, 1, 1]`, `[26, 1, 1]`, `[1, 26, 1]`, or `[26, 26, 1]`; `info` includes `[26, 26, lex]` as its last element; `i` is 4; `lex` is an integer; `j` is 2.**

Explanation: The array `arr` had one of several possible values initially. After executing `arr.append(1)`, `1` is added to the end of `arr`. The values of `info`, `i`, `lex`, and `j` remain unchanged.
