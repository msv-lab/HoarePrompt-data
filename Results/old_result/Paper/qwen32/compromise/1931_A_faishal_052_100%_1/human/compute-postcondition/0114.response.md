The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2, but since the condition for the loop is `j < 2`, the loop will not execute again once `j` becomes 2.

However, to answer the question strictly about adjusting the state for the loop to execute one more time before it terminates, we increment `j` by 1 from its current value of 1.

State: **`arr` is either `[]`, `[1]`, `[26]`, `[1, 1]`, `[26, 1]`, or `[1, 26]`, `[26, 26]`; `info` includes `[26, 26, lex]` as its last element; `i` is 4; `lex` is an integer; `j` is 2**
