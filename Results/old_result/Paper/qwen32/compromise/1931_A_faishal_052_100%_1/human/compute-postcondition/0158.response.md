To determine the output of the `print(temp)` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. **`info`**: This is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays. Each array is generated based on a corresponding `lex` value.
2. **`i`**: This variable is set to 2.
3. **`temp`**: This variable is constructed by taking the first three elements of the third array in `info` (since `i` is 2, `info[2]` refers to the third array). For each of these elements, 96 is added to it, and the result is converted to its corresponding ASCII character. These characters are then concatenated together.

Given this, let's denote the third array in `info` as `[a, b, c]`. Therefore, `info[2]` is `[a, b, c]`.

The construction of `temp` can be described as follows:
- `info[2][0] + 96` converts the first element `a` to its corresponding ASCII character after adding 96.
- `info[2][1] + 96` converts the second element `b` to its corresponding ASCII character after adding 96.
- `info[2][2] + 96` converts the third element `c` to its corresponding ASCII character after adding 96.

These three ASCII characters are then concatenated to form the string `temp`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, we can only describe `temp` in terms of these variables.

Thus, the output will be a string formed by concatenating the ASCII characters corresponding to `a + 96`, `b + 96`, and `c + 96`.

Output: **temp (where temp is the concatenation of ASCII characters corresponding to info[2][0] + 96, info[2][1] + 96, and info[2][2] + 96)**
