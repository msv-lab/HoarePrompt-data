The code concatenates a character to the `temp` string based on the value of `info[i][j]`. Specifically, it adds the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][j] + 96`.

Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 0, `info[1][0]` is the element being referenced. The `chr()` function converts this value plus 96 into its corresponding character.

Output State: **`info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; `cases` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `temp` is the character corresponding to `info[1][0] + 96`; `j` is 0.**

In natural language: The `temp` variable now holds the character derived from `info[1][0] + 96`. All other variables retain their initial values.
