Postcondition: **`arr` is either `[]` or `[1]` or `[26]`; `info` includes `[26, 26, lex]` as its last element; `i` is 4; `lex` is an integer. If `lex` is less than 27, `arr` is `[1]`. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 inclusive, `arr` is `[26]`. If `lex` is 27 or greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is `[]`.**
