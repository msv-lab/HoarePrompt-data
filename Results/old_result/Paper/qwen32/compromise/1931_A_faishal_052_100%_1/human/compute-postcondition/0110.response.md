Output State: **`arr` is either `[1, 26]` or `[26, 26]` or `[26]`; `info` includes `[26, 26, lex]` as its last element; `i` is 4; `lex` is an integer. If `lex` was less than 27, `arr` is `[1, 26]` and `lex` is now `lex - 26` (which means `lex` is now less than 1). If `lex` was between 28 and 51 inclusive, `arr` is `[26, 26]` and `lex` is now `lex - 26` (which means `lex` is now between 2 and 25 inclusive). If `lex` was 27 or greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is `[26]` and `lex` is now `lex - 26` (which means `lex` is now 1 or greater than or equal to 26); `j` is 1**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. Depending on the original value of `lex`, `arr` remains `[1, 26]`, `[26, 26]`, or `[26]`. The new value of `lex` adjusts accordingly based on its original range. All other variables remain unchanged.
