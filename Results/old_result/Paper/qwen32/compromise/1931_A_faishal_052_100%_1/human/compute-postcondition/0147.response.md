To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop operates and what it modifies. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 2 (inclusive), meaning it will execute exactly 3 times. During each iteration, the variable `temp` is updated by appending the character corresponding to `info[1][j] + 96` to its current value.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `info`: Contains `cases` number of sorted arrays.
   - `t` and `n`: Remain unchanged.
   - `cases`: Must be greater than 0.
   - `i`: Is set to 1.
   - `temp`: Is initialized as an empty string.
   - `j`: Is initially set to 2 but is overwritten by the loop.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - **First Iteration (j=0)**: `temp` becomes `chr(info[1][0] + 96)`.
   - **Second Iteration (j=1)**: `temp` becomes `chr(info[1][0] + 96) + chr(info[1][1] + 96)`.
   - **Third Iteration (j=2)**: `temp` becomes `chr(info[1][0] + 96) + chr(info[1][1] + 96) + chr(info[1][2] + 96)`.

After these three iterations, the loop completes, and the final value of `temp` will be the concatenation of the characters derived from `info[1][0] + 96`, `info[1][1] + 96`, and `info[1][2] + 96`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; `cases` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `temp` is the character corresponding to `info[1][0] + 96` concatenated with the character corresponding to `info[1][1] + 96` and then concatenated with the character corresponding to `info[1][2] + 96`; `j` is 2.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `temp` will contain a string formed by converting the first three elements of the second array in `info` (after adding 96 to each element) into their corresponding ASCII characters. All other variables (`info`, `t`, `n`, `cases`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
