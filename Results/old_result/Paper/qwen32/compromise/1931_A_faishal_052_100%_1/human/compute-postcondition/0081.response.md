Postcondition: **`arr` is a list with three elements where the third element is `1` if `lex` was originally less than 28, and `26` if `lex` was originally 28 or more. Specifically, `arr` is `[1, 1, 1]` if `lex` was originally less than 26, `[26, 1, 1]` if `lex` was between 1 and 51 inclusive or between 52 and 77, `[1, 1, 1]` if `lex` was greater than 77 but less than or equal to 78, `[1, 26, 1]` if `lex - 26` is less than 27, `[26, 26, 1]` if `lex - 26` is between 2 and 52 inclusive or between 53 and 78, `[26, 1, 1]` if `lex - 26` is greater than 78, `[1, 1, 26]` if `lex` was originally less than 26, `[26, 1, 26]` if `lex` was between 1 and 51 inclusive or between 52 and 77, `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` was greater than 77 but less than or equal to 78, `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex - 26` is less than 27, `[26, 26, 26]` if `lex - 26` is between 2 and 52 inclusive or between 53 and 78, `[26, 26, 26]` if `lex - 26` is greater than 78. `lex` is an integer that has been decremented by 2 if it was originally less than 28, and reduced by 27 if it was originally less than or equal to 78, or decreased by 26 if it was originally 28 or more. `info` contains an empty list as its last element. `i` is `x + 1`. `cases` remains unchanged. `j` is 2.**
