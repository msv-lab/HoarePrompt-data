Output State: **`arr` is a list containing one element `[1]`; `lex` is an input integer with a value less than 27; `info` contains an empty list as its last element; `i` is `x + 1`; `cases` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decremented by 1, so if it was initially less than 28, it is now less than 27. All other variables remain unchanged.
