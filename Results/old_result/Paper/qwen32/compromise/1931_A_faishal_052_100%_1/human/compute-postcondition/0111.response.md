Postcondition: **`arr` is either `[1, 26]`, `[26, 26]`, or `[26]`; `info` includes `[26, 26, lex]` as its last element; `i` is 4; `lex` is an integer. If `lex` was less than 27, `arr` is `[1, 26]` and `lex` is now less than 1. If `lex` was between 28 and 51 inclusive, `arr` is `[26, 26]` and `lex` is now between 2 and 25 inclusive. If `lex` was 27 or greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is `[26]` and `lex` is now 1 or greater than or equal to 26; `j` is 1. If `lex` is greater than 78, the state remains unchanged from the precondition.**
