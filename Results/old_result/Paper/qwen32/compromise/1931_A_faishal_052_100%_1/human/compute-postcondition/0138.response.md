Let's break down the given initial state and determine what will be printed by the `print(temp)` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:

- `info`: This is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays. Each array is generated based on a corresponding `lex` value. Since the exact contents of `info` are not specified, we know only that it contains sorted arrays.
- `cases`: The number of cases, which is greater than 0.
- `t` and `n`: These remain unchanged but their values are not relevant to the current print statement.
- `i`: This is set to 0.
- `temp`: This is a string constructed from the characters corresponding to `chr(info[0][0] + 96)`, `chr(info[0][1] + 96)`, and `chr(info[0][2] + 96)`.
- `j`: This is set to 2, but it does not affect the current print statement.

### Calculation of `temp`:

- `temp` is constructed using the first three elements of the first array in `info`.
- `chr(info[0][0] + 96)`: This converts the first element of the first array in `info` to a character. Since `info` contains sorted arrays, `info[0][0]` is the smallest element in the first array. Adding 96 to this value and converting it to a character will give us a lowercase letter (since `chr(97)` is 'a').
- Similarly, `chr(info[0][1] + 96)` and `chr(info[0][2] + 96)` convert the second and third smallest elements of the first array in `info` to characters.

### Example Calculation:

Assume `info[0]` is `[1, 2, 3]` (a common scenario for a sorted array starting with the smallest positive integers):

- `chr(1 + 96)` -> `chr(97)` -> 'a'
- `chr(2 + 96)` -> `chr(98)` -> 'b'
- `chr(3 + 96)` -> `chr(99)` -> 'c'

Thus, `temp` would be `'abc'`.

### General Case:

Without knowing the exact contents of `info[0]`, we can describe `temp` as a string formed by converting the first three elements of the first array in `info` to their corresponding lowercase letters.

### Final Output:

Output: **temp (where temp is a string formed by converting the first three elements of the first array in info to their corresponding lowercase letters)**
