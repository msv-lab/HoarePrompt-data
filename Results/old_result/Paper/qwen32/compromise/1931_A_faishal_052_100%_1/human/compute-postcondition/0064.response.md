The code snippet `lex = lex - 1` decrements the value of `lex` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged unless their values depend on `lex`. Since the value of `lex` affects the initial state of `arr`, we need to consider the new value of `lex` to determine the new state of `arr`.

Here's the updated state:

- If the original `lex` was less than 27, then after decrementing, `lex` is now less than 26. So, `arr` should be `[1, 1]`.
- If the original `lex` was between 2 and 52 inclusive or between 53 and 78, then after decrementing, `lex` is now between 1 and 51 inclusive or between 52 and 77. So, `arr` should be `[26, 1]`.
- If the original `lex` was greater than 78, then after decrementing, `lex` is now greater than 77. So, `arr` should be `[1]`.

The values of `info`, `i`, `cases`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is `[1, 1]` if `lex` is less than 26, `arr` is `[26, 1]` if `lex` is between 1 and 51 inclusive or between 52 and 77, `arr` is `[1]` if `lex` is greater than 77; `lex` is an integer decremented by 1; `info` contains an empty list as its last element; `i` is `x + 1`; `cases` remains unchanged; `j` is 1.**
