The code modifies the variable `temp` by appending another character to it. The new character is determined by converting the ASCII value of `info[i][j] + 96` to its corresponding character using the `chr` function.

Given the initial state, `temp` was initially set to the character corresponding to `info[1][0] + 96`. After executing the line `temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)`, `temp` now includes this additional character.

Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, the new character appended to `temp` is derived from `info[1][1] + 96`.

Therefore, the updated `temp` will be the concatenation of the initial `temp` (which was `chr(info[1][0] + 96)`) and the new character `chr(info[1][1] + 96)`.

Output State: **`info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; `cases` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `temp` is the character corresponding to `info[1][0] + 96` concatenated with the character corresponding to `info[1][1] + 96`; `j` is 1.**
