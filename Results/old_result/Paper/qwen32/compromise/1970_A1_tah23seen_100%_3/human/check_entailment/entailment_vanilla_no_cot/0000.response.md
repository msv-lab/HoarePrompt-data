Correctness: **False**

The given program is not correct because it does not properly handle the sorting and construction of the balanced shuffle. Specifically, the dictionary `d` is used to store the prefix balances, but the keys in the dictionary are the positions plus one, and the dictionary items are sorted based on these keys. This leads to an incorrect sorting order for the characters based on the problem's requirements.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    balances = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        balances.append((balance, -i, s[i]))  # Store balance, negative index, and character

    # Sort by balance, then by negative index (to get decreasing order of positions)
    balances.sort()

    # Construct the result from sorted items
    ans = ''.join(char for _, _, char in balances)
    return ans

# Read input and print the result
n = input().strip()
print(func_1(n))
```

In this corrected version:
- We store a tuple of `(balance, -i, s[i])` in the `balances` list, where `balance` is the prefix balance up to the current character, `-i` is the negative index to ensure positions are sorted in decreasing order when balances are the same, and `s[i]` is the character itself.
- We sort the list of tuples based on the balance and then by the negative index.
- Finally, we construct the result string by joining the characters from the sorted list of tuples.
