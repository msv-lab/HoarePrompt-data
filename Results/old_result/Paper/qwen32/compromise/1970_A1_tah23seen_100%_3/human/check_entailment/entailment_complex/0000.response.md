Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` is supposed to return a new sequence by sorting the characters based on their prefix balances and positions.

However, the current implementation does not achieve this. Instead, it calculates the balance for each position, sorts the positions by balance and position, and then constructs a new sequence by appending characters from the original sequence in the sorted order of their positions. This results in the original sequence being returned, not the balanced shuffle.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the issues:
1. The dictionary `d` is built to store the prefix balance at each position.
2. The dictionary `d` is then sorted by prefix balance and position.
3. The characters from the original sequence are appended to `ans` in the order of their positions after sorting.

The sorting step should result in a sequence where characters are ordered by their prefix balance in increasing order, and in case of ties, by their position in decreasing order. However, the characters are still appended in the order of their original positions, not the sorted positions.

Thus, the program does not correctly perform the balanced shuffle operation.

Correctness: **False**
