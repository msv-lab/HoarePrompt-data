Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is '.', `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is `j_old + 1` where `j_old + 1 < len(b)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `t`, `n`, `path`, `a`, `d`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged, but we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
