Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is '.', `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a non-empty string, and `j` is `j_old + 1` where `j_old + 1 < len(b)`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `b[j + 1] == '*'` or if the `if b[:]` condition is met. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
