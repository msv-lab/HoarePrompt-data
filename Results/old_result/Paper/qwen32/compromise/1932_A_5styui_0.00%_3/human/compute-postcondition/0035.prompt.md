Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is '.'; `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `s` is 0; `d` is an input integer; `b` is an input string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(b)):
    if b[j] == '@':
        s = s + 1
    elif b[j] == '*':
        if b[:]:
            break
        elif b[j + 1] == '*':
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is '.'; `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `d` is an input integer; `b` is an input string that must have at least one character. If `b[j]` is equal to '@', then `s` is set to 1. Otherwise, `s` remains 0. If `b[j]` is '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `b` is non-empty or if `b[j + 1]` equals '*'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is '.'; `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `d` is an input integer; `b` is an input string that must have at least one character. If `b[j]` is equal to '@', then `s` is set to 1. Otherwise, `s` remains 0. If `b[j]` is '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `b` is non-empty or if `b[j + 1]` equals '*'. `j` is now `j + 1`. If `b[j]` was '@', `s` is incremented by 1, so `s` is now 1. If `b[j]` was not '@', `s` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is '.'; `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `d` is an input integer; `b` is an input string that must have at least one character; `s` is set based on the value of `b[j]` plus 1 if `b[j]` is '@', otherwise `s` is set based on the value of `b[j]`; `j` is incremented by 1. If `b[j]` is '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `b` is not empty or if `b[j + 1]` is '*'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
