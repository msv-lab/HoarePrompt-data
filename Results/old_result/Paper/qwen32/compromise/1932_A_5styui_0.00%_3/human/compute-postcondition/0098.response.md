Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is '.', `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a non-empty string. If `b[j]` is '@', `s` is 1 or 2 depending on its original value. If `b[j]` is not '@', `s` is 1 if `b[j]` is '@', otherwise `s` is 0. The values of `i` and `j` are incremented by 1 if `j + 1 < len(b)`. If `b[j]` is '*', the loop or if statement is terminated.**
