The code snippet `rev_res = rev_res + x` adds the value of `x` to the existing value of `rev_res`. The initial state specifies that `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`, and the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the string representation of `x`. This information about `x_rev` is not directly affected by the code snippet provided, so it remains unchanged.

The only variable that changes is `rev_res`, which now includes the addition of `x` to its previous value.

Output State: **`x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`, and the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the string representation of `x`; `rev_res` is the sum of its previous value and `x`.**
