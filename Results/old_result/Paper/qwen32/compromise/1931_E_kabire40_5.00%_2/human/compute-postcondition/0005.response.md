To determine the necessary state adjustments for the given for loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head and the variables involved.

The for loop is:
```python
for x in operational_list:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variables in the loop head are:
- `x`: This is the loop variable that will take on the value of each element in `operational_list` during each iteration.
- `operational_list`: This is the list over which the loop iterates.

The state before the loop starts is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `y` is 0.
- `rev_val` is an empty list.
- `rev_res` is an empty string.
- `list_len` is the first value from the input.
- `max_power` is the second value from the input.
- `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input.

To ensure the loop can execute, the only variable we can adjust in the loop head is `operational_list`. The loop will execute if `operational_list` contains at least one element.

Given this, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `operational_list` has at least one substring.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input that must have at least 1 substring**
