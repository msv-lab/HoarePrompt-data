Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input that must have at least 2 substrings, `x` is the second element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`. If the length of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is the string representation of `x_rev` and `rev_val` is an empty list. Otherwise, `rev_res` is an empty string and `rev_val` is a list containing the second element of `operational_list` and the reverse of `x`.**
