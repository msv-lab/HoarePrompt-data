Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input, `rev_res` is the concatenated string of all substrings from `operational_list` that, when reversed, have the same length as the original substring, plus the reverse of `val_in`, `rev_val` is a list of all reversed substrings from `operational_list` that do not meet the length criteria, `rev_val` is sorted, `rev_val` must have at least one element, and `x` is an odd integer; `val_in` is `rev_val[x]`.**
