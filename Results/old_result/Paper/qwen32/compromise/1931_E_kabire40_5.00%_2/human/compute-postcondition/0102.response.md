Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 2, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input, `rev_res` is a concatenation of all original strings `x` from `operational_list` where `x` is equal to its reverse, plus the integer value of `rev_val[x]` if `x` is even, or the reverse of `rev_val[x]` if `x` is odd, for all `x` in the range of `len(rev_val)`, `rev_val` is an empty list.**

In simple terms, the variable `rev_val` has been reset to an empty list, while all other variables retain their initial values.
