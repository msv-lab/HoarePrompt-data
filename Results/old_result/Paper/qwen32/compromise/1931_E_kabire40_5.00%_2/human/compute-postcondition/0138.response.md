Postcondition: **`t` is unchanged, `y` is 2, `list_len` is unchanged, `max_power` is unchanged, `operational_list` is unchanged, `rev_val` is a list of reversed strings of all substrings from `operational_list` that do not maintain the same length when reversed, sorted in ascending order, and `rev_val` must have at least one element, `x` is 3, `len(rev_val)` must be greater than 3. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the concatenation of all substrings from `operational_list` that maintain the same length when reversed, followed by the original string at index 3 of `rev_val`, and then the string representation of `val_in`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is the concatenation of all substrings from `operational_list` that maintain the same length when reversed, followed by the original string at index 3 of `rev_val` and then the reverse of the string at index 3 of `rev_val`. `val_in` is the integer representation of the string at index 3 of `rev_val` if `x` is even, or the element at index 3 of `rev_val` if `x` is odd.**
