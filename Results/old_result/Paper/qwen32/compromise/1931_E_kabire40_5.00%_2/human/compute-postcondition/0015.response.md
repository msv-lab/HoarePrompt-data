Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input that must have at least 1 substring, `x` is the second substring in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the new `x` reversed. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the new `x`, then `rev_res` is the string representation of the new `x` and `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of the new `x` as a string. Otherwise, `rev_res` is an empty string and `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of the new `x` as a string. `rev_val` now contains the reverse of `x` as a string.**

In simpler terms, the variable `rev_val` now contains the reverse of the string `x` as its first (and only) element. All other variables remain unchanged.
