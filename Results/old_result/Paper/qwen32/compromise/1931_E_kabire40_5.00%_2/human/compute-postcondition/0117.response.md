Postcondition: **`x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the string `x`, `operational_list` must have at least one more element, `x` is the next element in `operational_list`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is the previous value of `rev_res` plus `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` has an additional element which is the reverse of `x`.**
