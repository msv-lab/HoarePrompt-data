Output State: **The program returns [7, 4]**

Explanation: Given the initial state, `total_max_segment` is determined based on the length of `total_max_segment` itself, which is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, the condition provided checks if the length of `total_max_segment` is 1, and if so, it sets `total_max_segment` to `[-1]`. Since there is no information suggesting that `total_max_segment` is initially of length 1, it retains its value as `[7, 4]` as per the provided initial state. Therefore, the program returns `[7, 4]`.
