Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers; `new_segment` is [5, 6]; `max_segment` is [7, 4]; `segments_variants` is [[3, 1], [7, 4], [7, 4, len(arr) - 1]]; `max_sum` is -1.**

The list `segments_variants` has been updated to include a new segment, which is the concatenation of `max_segment` and a list containing the value `len(arr) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
