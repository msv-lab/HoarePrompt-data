To ensure that the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head, which is `i` and `len(arr)`. The loop will execute if `len(arr)` is at least 1. 

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **`arr`**: This is a list of integers. For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one integer. 
2. **`i`**: This is the loop variable. Before the loop starts, `i` is not explicitly defined, but it will be initialized to 0 by the loop. Therefore, we don't need to adjust `i` before the loop starts.
3. **`len(arr)`**: This is the length of the list `arr`. For the loop to execute, `len(arr)` must be greater than 0.

The other variables (`new_segment`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`, `max_sum`) are not part of the loop head, so we do not need to adjust their states for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `arr` has at least one integer.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer**
