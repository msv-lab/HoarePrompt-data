Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers; `new_segment` is [5, 6]; `max_segment` is [7, 4]; `segments_variants` is [[3, 1], [7, 4], [7, 4, len(arr) - 1], [5, 6, len(arr) - 1]]; `max_sum` is -1; `total_max_segment` is [-1]**.

Explanation: The variable `total_max_segment` is initialized with the value `[-1]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
