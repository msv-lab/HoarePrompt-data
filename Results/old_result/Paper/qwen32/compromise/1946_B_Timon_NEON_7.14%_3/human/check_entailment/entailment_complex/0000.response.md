### Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze how each function contributes to solving the problem described.

#### Problem Overview:
The task is to maximize the sum of an array after performing `k` operations. Each operation involves selecting any contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array. The final sum of the array should be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Analysis of Functions:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Purpose**: To return the result of `number % 1000000007`.
   - **Implementation**: Correctly returns the remainder when `number` is divided by \(10^9 + 7\).
   - **Conclusion**: This function is correct.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Purpose**: To find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in the given array.
   - **Implementation**: Uses a modified version of Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray. It maintains a list of potential segments and their sums, and finally returns the segment with the maximum sum.
   - **Conclusion**: This function is correct for finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Not used in the provided code snippet.
   - **Implementation**: Simply initializes `answer` to 0 and does not perform any operations.
   - **Conclusion**: Since this function is not used, its correctness is irrelevant to the current problem.

#### Overall Program Logic:
- **Input Parsing**: Reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads the length of the array `n`, the number of operations `k`, and the array `a`.
- **Finding Maximum Segment**: Uses `func_2` to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.
- **Calculating the Answer**:
  - If the maximum segment sum is negative, it is set to 0.
  - The final answer is calculated as `max_segment_sum * 2^k + sum(a) - max_segment_sum`.
  - The result is then taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using `func_1`.

#### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the logic with the first test case:
- **Input**: `n = 2`, `k = 2`, `a = [-4, -7]`
- **Maximum Segment Sum**: `0` (since both elements are negative, the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is 0).
- **Final Answer**: `0 * 2^2 + (-4 - 7) - 0 = -11`, which is `999999996` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

This matches the expected output, indicating that the logic is correct.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, and it handles the modulo operation correctly.

**Correctness: True**
