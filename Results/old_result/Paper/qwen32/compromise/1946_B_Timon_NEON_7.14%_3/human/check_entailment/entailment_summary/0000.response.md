### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided code and its functions to verify if they correctly solve the problem.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations.
2. **Operation**: Select any contiguous subarray, compute its sum, and insert this sum anywhere in the array.
3. **Output**: The maximum possible sum of the array modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Provided Code Analysis:

1. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop reads `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of array) and `k` (number of operations).
   - It then reads the array `a` of `n` integers.
   - It computes the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray using `func_2`.
   - If the maximum sum is negative, it sets it to `0`.
   - It calculates the final answer using the formula: `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - It prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes an integer and returns it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - This is correct as the problem requires the result to be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is intended to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray and its ending index.
   - The function initializes `max_segment` and `new_segment` to track the maximum sum and the current segment being considered.
   - It iterates through the array, updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` based on the current element.
   - It appends the maximum segment found to `segments_variants`.
   - It returns the segment with the maximum sum.
   - This is correct for finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, following Kadane's algorithm principles.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - The provided code for `func_3` is incomplete and does not seem to be used in the main logic.
   - Since it is not referenced in the main loop, it does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Verification of the Formula:
The formula used to calculate the final answer is:
\[ \text{answer} = \text{max\_segment}[0] \times 2^k + \sum(\text{a}) - \text{max\_segment}[0] \]

- **Explanation**:
  - `max_segment[0] * 2^k`: This term considers the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray being repeatedly inserted.
  - `sum(a)`: This is the initial sum of the array.
  - `-max_segment[0]`: This term adjusts for the initial inclusion of `max_segment[0]` in the sum of the array (since it is already counted in `max_segment[0] * 2^k`).

### Conclusion:
The provided functions and the main logic correctly implement the solution to the problem. Function `func_3` is not used and can be ignored.

**Correctness: True**
