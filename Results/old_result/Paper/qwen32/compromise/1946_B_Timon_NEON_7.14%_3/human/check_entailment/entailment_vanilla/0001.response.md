Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have an array `a` of `n` integers.
   - We can perform exactly `k` operations where each operation involves selecting any contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting that sum anywhere in the array.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations.
   - The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - To maximize the sum, we should focus on maximizing the sum of the subarray we select for insertion.
   - The best strategy is to repeatedly insert the sum of the maximum subarray (subarray with the largest sum) obtained from the current array.
   - This strategy is optimal because the sum of the maximum subarray will always yield the highest possible increase in the total sum of the array.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - Compute the Kadane's maximum subarray sum for the given array.
   - If the maximum subarray sum is positive, we can keep adding this sum to the array.
   - If the maximum subarray sum is non-positive, the best strategy is to add zeros (i.e., the sum of an empty subarray).

4. **Implementation:**
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to find the maximum subarray sum and its indices.
   - The function `func_3` is supposed to compute the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.
   - The function `func_1` is a utility function to compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Issues in the Provided Code:**
   - The function `func_2` is partially implemented and does not correctly find the maximum subarray sum. It seems to be attempting to find segments but does not handle all edge cases correctly.
   - The function `func_3` is not implemented at all and does not perform the necessary calculations to determine the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.
   - The function `func_1` is correctly defined but not used in the provided code.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incomplete and does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Specifically, the function `func_3` is not implemented, and the function `func_2` is not correctly finding the maximum subarray sum.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
