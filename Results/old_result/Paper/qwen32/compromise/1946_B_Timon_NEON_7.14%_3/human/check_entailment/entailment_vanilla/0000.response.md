To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the problem and the given code step by step.

### Problem Analysis:

The problem involves an array of integers and a series of operations where a contiguous subarray can be selected, and its sum can be inserted anywhere in the array. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after a specified number of such operations. The result should be provided modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Key Points:

1. **Maximizing the Sum**: The best strategy to maximize the sum is to repeatedly add the maximum possible sum of any contiguous subarray (which can be found using Kadane's algorithm) to the array.
2. **Modulo Operation**: Since the sum can be very large, the result should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
3. **Edge Cases**: The array can contain negative numbers, and the maximum sum of a subarray might be zero (if all numbers are negative).

### Code Analysis:

#### Function 1: `func_1(number)`
This function simply returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is a correct and necessary operation to ensure the result fits within the required constraints.

#### Function 2: `func_2(arr)`
This function is supposed to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in the array `arr` and return the details of this subarray (sum, start index, end index). However, there are several issues with this function:
- **Initialization**: `max_segment` and `new_segment` are initialized with `[0, 0]`, which can lead to incorrect results if the maximum subarray sum is negative.
- **Logic Errors**: The logic for updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` is flawed. It doesn't correctly handle the case when the maximum subarray sum is negative or when the array contains only negative numbers.
- **Appending Segments**: The function appends segments to `segments_variants` in a way that doesn't guarantee the correct maximum segment.

#### Function 3: `func_3(number, quantity)`
This function is incomplete and doesn't perform any operations. It should calculate the maximum possible sum after `quantity` operations using the maximum subarray sum found by `func_2`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with `func_2` and the incomplete `func_3`, the provided program is not correct. The logic for finding the maximum subarray sum and using it to compute the final result is flawed.

**Correctness: False**
