Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly maximize the product of the two numbers by performing the allowed operations. The logic in the function `func_1()` is flawed as it does not consider all possible swaps that could lead to a higher product. Specifically, the flag `f` is set to `1` after the first swap or comparison, which means that subsequent digits are not considered for swapping optimally.

To maximize the product, a more optimal strategy would be to compare each pair of digits from `x` and `y` and swap them if it increases the product. A simple greedy approach can be used where, for each position, the larger digit should be in the larger number. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a = list(input().strip())
    b = list(input().strip())
    
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] < b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
    
    print(''.join(a))
    print(''.join(b))
```

This version of the function correctly swaps digits to maximize the product of the two numbers.
