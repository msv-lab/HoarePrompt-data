Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly maximize the product of `x` and `y` by swapping corresponding digits. The logic in `func_1` only performs a single swap if the first digit of `x` is less than the first digit of `y` and then stops making any further swaps. This is insufficient to maximize the product.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
91
19
```
The program will output:
```
91
19
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
99
11
```
Swapping the digits results in a higher product (99 * 11 = 1089) compared to the original product (91 * 19 = 1729).

The program needs to consider all possible swaps to maximize the product, not just the first one. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this and similar cases.
