Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; For each test case, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x < 10^100 and 1 <= y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9. Additionally, `x` and `y` have the same number of digits in each test case; `a` is a list of characters representing the input string; `b` is a list of characters representing the input string.**

Explanation: The variable `b` is assigned the value of the input string converted to a list of characters. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `a` remain unchanged.
