### Reasoning:
The given Python program aims to solve the problem by following these steps:

1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
3. It sorts the list of integers in ascending order.
4. It iteratively picks pairs of integers from the sorted list, adds the smaller of the two to the score, and removes both integers from the list.
5. This process continues until all integers have been paired and removed.
6. Finally, it prints the calculated score for each test case.

The strategy of sorting the list in ascending order and always picking the smallest available integers ensures that we maximize the score by always adding the smallest possible value from each pair to the score. This aligns with the optimal strategy described in the problem statement.

Given the provided execution summary, the program correctly implements the described approach and should yield the maximum possible score for each test case.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
