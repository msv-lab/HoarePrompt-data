### Reasoning:
To solve the problem, we need to maximize the score by choosing pairs of integers from the list and adding the smaller of the two integers to the score. The optimal strategy involves sorting the list of integers in ascending order and then pairing the smallest integers together. This ensures that we always add the smallest possible values to our score, thereby maximizing it.

Let's break down the provided program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers (`2n`) and the list of integers.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The list of integers is sorted in ascending order using `numbers.sort(reverse=False)`.

3. **Pairing and Summing:**
   - The program then enters a loop where it repeatedly pops the first two elements from the sorted list (which are the smallest available), calculates their minimum (which is simply the first element due to sorting), and adds this value to the score (`suma`).
   - This process continues until all elements have been paired and summed.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all pairs for a given test case, the program prints the total score (`suma`).

### Verification Against Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1:** 
  - Input: `1`, `[2, 3]`
  - Sorted: `[2, 3]`
  - Pairs: `(2, 3)`
  - Score: `2`
  - Output: `2`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `2`, `[1, 1, 2, 1]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 1, 1, 2]`
  - Pairs: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`
  - Score: `1 + 1 = 2`
  - Output: `2`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `3`, `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Pairs: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 1)`, `(1, 1)`
  - Score: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
  - Output: `3`

The program correctly implements the strategy of sorting the list and pairing the smallest elements together to maximize the score. It also correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the expected results.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
