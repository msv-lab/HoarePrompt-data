You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

        numbers.sort(reverse=False)
        suma = 0

            a = int(numbers.pop(0))
            b = int(numbers.pop(0))
            suma += min(a, b)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of:
- An integer `n` representing the number of pairs of integers.
- A list of `2n` integers.

The goal is to maximize the score by choosing pairs of integers and adding the minimum of each pair to the score.

### Program Logic

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case:
     - The integer `n` is read.
     - The list of `2n` integers is read and split into a list of strings.
     - The list is sorted in ascending order.
     - A variable `suma` is initialized to zero to keep track of the score.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - While there are still elements in the list:
     - The smallest element `a` is popped from the front of the list.
     - The next smallest element `b` is popped from the front of the list.
     - The minimum of `a` and `b` is added to `suma`.

3. **Output:**
   - The final score `suma` is printed for each test case.

### Verification Against Problem Description

The program correctly implements the strategy of always pairing the smallest available integers to maximize the score. Here's why:

- **Sorting:** By sorting the list in ascending order, the smallest integers are always at the beginning of the list.
- **Pairing Strategy:** By popping the smallest two integers in each iteration, the program ensures that the minimum of each pair is added to the score, which is optimal.
- **Edge Cases:** The program handles the minimum and maximum constraints given in the problem description:
  - `1 ≤ t ≤ 5000`
  - `1 ≤ n ≤ 50`
  - `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7`

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the required logic for all valid inputs within the given constraints. It handles the sorting and pairing strategy optimally to achieve the maximum score.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program sorts the list of integers in ascending order and pairs the smallest integers together, ensuring that the minimum of each pair is added to the score. This strategy is optimal for maximizing the score, and the program handles all edge cases within the given constraints.
