### Reasoning:

The goal of the problem is to maximize the score by choosing pairs of numbers from the list and adding the smaller number of each pair to the score. The strategy to achieve this is to sort the list of numbers in ascending order and then pair them sequentially (first with second, third with fourth, etc.). By doing so, we ensure that the smaller numbers are paired together, thus maximizing the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair.

Let's break down the code step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs (`n`) and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The list of integers is sorted in ascending order using `numbers.sort(reverse=False)`.

3. **Pairing and Summing:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted list, popping the smallest two numbers at a time and adding the smaller one (which is always the first popped number due to sorting) to the score (`suma`).

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all pairs for a test case, the program prints the computed score.

This approach ensures that we are always adding the smallest available number to the score, which aligns with the optimal strategy described above.

### Verification Against Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `1`, `2 3`
  - Sorted: `[2, 3]`
  - Pairs: `(2, 3)`
  - Score: `2`
  - Output: `2`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `2`, `1 1 2 1`
  - Sorted: `[1, 1, 1, 2]`
  - Pairs: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`
  - Score: `1 + 1 = 2`
  - Output: `2`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `3`, `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Sorted: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Pairs: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 1)`, `(1, 1)`
  - Score: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
  - Output: `3`

All test cases match the expected outputs, confirming that the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
