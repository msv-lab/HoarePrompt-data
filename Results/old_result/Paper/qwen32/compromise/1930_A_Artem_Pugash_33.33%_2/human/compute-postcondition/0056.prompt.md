Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer read from input representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is the integer value of the last element processed (if any), `numInteger` is an integer read from input, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings in ascending order, `suma` is 0, `i` is 2.
Code of the loop:
while numbers != []:
    a = int(numbers.pop(0))
    b = int(numbers.pop(0))
    suma += min(a, b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer read from input representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is the integer value of the first element of the original `numbers` list, `numInteger` is an integer read from input, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings in ascending order with the first two elements removed, `suma` is `min(a, b)`, `i` is 2, `b` is the integer value of the string that was the second element of the original `numbers` list.`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer read from input representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is the integer value of the third element of the original `numbers` list, `numInteger` is an integer read from input, `numbers` is a non-empty sorted list of strings in ascending order with the first four elements removed, `suma` is `suma + a`, `i` is 2, `b` is the integer value of the third element of the original `numbers` list.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer read from input representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is the integer value of the first element of the modified `numbers` list, `numInteger` is an integer read from input, `numbers` is a non-empty sorted list of strings in ascending order with the first six elements removed, `suma` is `suma + a + min(a, b)`, `i` is 2, `b` is the integer value of the second element of the original `numbers` list.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
