The code snippet reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `numInteger`. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer read from input representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is the integer value of the first element of the last pair processed, `numInteger` is an integer read from input, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of numbers processed in the loop, `i` is 1**.
