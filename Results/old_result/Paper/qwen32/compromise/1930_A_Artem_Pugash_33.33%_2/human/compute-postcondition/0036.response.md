The code snippet `suma += min(a, b)` updates the value of `suma` by adding the minimum of `a` and `b` to its current value.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000
- `numCases` is an integer read from input representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50
- `a` is the integer value of the new first element that was just removed from `numbers`
- `numInteger` is an integer read from input
- `numbers` is a non-empty sorted list of strings in ascending order with the first three elements removed
- `suma` is `2 * min(a, b)`
- `i` is 1
- `b` is the integer value of the new first element that was just removed from `numbers`

After executing `suma += min(a, b)`, the value of `suma` changes. Specifically, `suma` now equals `2 * min(a, b) + min(a, b)`, which simplifies to `3 * min(a, b)`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is an integer read from input representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is the integer value of the new first element that was just removed from `numbers`, `numInteger` is an integer read from input, `numbers` is a non-empty sorted list of strings in ascending order with the first three elements removed, `suma` is `3 * min(a, b)`, `i` is 1, `b` is the integer value of the new first element that was just removed from `numbers`.**
