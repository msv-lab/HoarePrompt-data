Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is 7; `a` is a list of integers derived from the string input by the user; `k` is an input integer; `x` is 7; `y` is 6; `c` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]; `d` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]; if `c` is equal to `d`, then `b` is a list with an additional element `1` appended to it. Otherwise, `b` is a list with an additional element `0` appended to it.**
