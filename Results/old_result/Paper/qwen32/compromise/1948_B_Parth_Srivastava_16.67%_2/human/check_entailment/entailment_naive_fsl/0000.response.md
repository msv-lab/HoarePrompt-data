Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for all potential cases. Here are a few issues and a counterexample to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

1. **Logic Error in Splitting Numbers:**
   - The program attempts to split numbers greater than 10 into their digits. However, it does not correctly handle the insertion of these digits back into the array at the same position.
   - For example, if the array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program should transform it into `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` to check if it can be sorted. However, the current implementation incorrectly appends the digits to the end of the array `c` without maintaining the original order.

2. **Comparison with Previous Element:**
   - The program checks if the digits of a number can be inserted based on the comparison with the previous element in the array `c`. This logic is flawed because it does not consider the correct position for the digits and can lead to incorrect conclusions about the possibility of sorting the array.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the array is already sorted or when the numbers are less than 10 correctly. It should be able to handle these cases without modification.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the input:
```
1
3
12 28 5
```
The program should output `NO` because there is no way to split the numbers to make the array sorted. However, the current implementation might incorrectly output `YES` due to the flawed logic.

### Corrected Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Recursively split numbers greater than 10 into their digits.
2. Check if the resulting array can be sorted by comparing adjacent elements after all possible splits.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(arr):
    new_arr = []
    for num in arr:
        if num >= 10:
            new_arr.extend([int(digit) for digit in str(num)])
        else:
            new_arr.append(num)
    return new_arr == sorted(new_arr)

m = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(m):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(a):
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected version ensures that all numbers greater than 10 are split into their digits, and then checks if the resulting array can be sorted.
