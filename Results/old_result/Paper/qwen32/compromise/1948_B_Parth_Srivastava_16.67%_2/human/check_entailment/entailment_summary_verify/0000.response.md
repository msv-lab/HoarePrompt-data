### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to evaluate its correctness based on the given problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Determine if an integer array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements greater than or equal to 10 into their individual digits.
- **Operations**:
  - Split a number greater than or equal to 10 into its digits and insert them in the same position.
- **Input**:
  - Multiple test cases, each with an integer array.
- **Output**:
  - For each test case, output "YES" if the array can be sorted using the operation, otherwise "NO".

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `k` and the array `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1`, the array `a` is processed by splitting numbers greater than 10 into their digits based on certain conditions.
   - The conditions involve checking the relationship between the digits and the previous elements in the list `c`.

3. **Checking Sorted Order**:
   - After processing, the list `c` is compared to its sorted version `d`.
   - If `c` is sorted, `1` is appended to `b`; otherwise, `0` is appended.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints "YES" if `b[i]` is `1`, otherwise "NO".

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function reads an integer `k` and a list of integers `a`.
- It processes the list by splitting numbers greater than 10 into their digits based on specific conditions.
- It checks if the resulting list `c` is sorted and appends `1` or `0` to `b` accordingly.

#### Issues with the Provided Program:
1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**:
   - The program splits numbers greater than 10 based on comparisons with the previous element, which is not the correct approach.
   - The digits should be inserted in the same position without considering the previous element's value.

2. **Inadequate Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the array is already sorted or where numbers are less than 10 correctly.
   - The logic for inserting digits is flawed and can lead to incorrect conclusions.

3. **Flawed Comparison**:
   - The comparison of the list `c` with its sorted version `d` does not account for the correct transformation of the array after all possible splits.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
3
12 28 5
```
- The correct approach should split `12` into `[1, 2]` and `28` into `[2, 8]`, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`.
- This array cannot be sorted into non-decreasing order by any further operations.

#### Corrected Approach:
The corrected version of the program should:
1. Recursively split numbers greater than or equal to 10 into their digits.
2. Check if the resulting array can be sorted by comparing adjacent elements after all possible splits.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for all potential cases due to the flawed logic for splitting numbers and checking the sorted order.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
