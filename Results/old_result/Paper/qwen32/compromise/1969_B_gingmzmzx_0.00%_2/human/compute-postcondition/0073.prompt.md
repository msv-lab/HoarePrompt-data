Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `s` is a binary string of length between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, consisting only of '0' and '1'. The sum of the lengths of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
    zeroes = s.count(0)
    cnt = [0, 0]
    ans = 0
    for c in s:
        cnt[c] += 1
        if c == 0:
            ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
        else:
            ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is [count of 0s in `s`, count of 1s in `s`], `ans` is the computed value based on the given logic.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, s is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, n is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, zeroes is the count of 0s in the list s, cnt is [total number of 0s, total number of 1s], ans is the accumulated sum based on the loop conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cnt` is `[total number of 0s in s, total number of 1s in s]`, `ans` is the accumulated result based on the described logic, `zeroes` is the initial count of 0s in `s`, `n` is `n + length of s`, `t` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
