The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the existing variables `t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, or `cnt`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of `ans` with a value of 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is [0, 0], `ans` is 0.**
