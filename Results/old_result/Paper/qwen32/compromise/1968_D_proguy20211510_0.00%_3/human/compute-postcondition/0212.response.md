Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `pb` and `ps` are integers, `preb` is `[sb + b[0], sb + b[1], ..., sb + b[n-1]]`, `pres` is recalculated and includes `s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[n-1] + a[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `sb` is updated to `sb + maxa` if `a[pb - 1] == maxa` or `a[ps - 1] == maxa` or `b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[n-1] + b[n]`, `ss` is recalculated and includes `a[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `i` is `n + 1`, `ptsb` is adjusted based on whether `a[pb - 1] == maxa` or `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `ptss` is recalculated and includes `pres[n] + (k - n - 1) * s[n]` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `foundb` is True, and `founds` is True. If `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, `b` includes an additional element `a[pb - 1]`. If `founds` is True, `s` is `[s[0], s[1], ..., s[n-1], maxa]`. If `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `s` includes `a[ps - 1]` as its last element and `founds` is True. If `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, `founds` remains unchanged. If `foundb` and `founds` are both True, `b` includes an additional element `(k - (n + 1)) * maxa` and `s` includes an additional element `(k - (n + 1)) * maxa`. If `foundb` is True and `founds` is False, `b` includes an additional element `maxa`. If `foundb` is False, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]` and `b` includes an additional element `a[pb - 1]`.**

In natural language: The variable `founds` is set to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
