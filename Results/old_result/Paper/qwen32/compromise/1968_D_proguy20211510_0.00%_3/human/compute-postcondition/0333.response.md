The code snippet `b.append(a[pb - 1])` appends the value of `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this operation. Here's the updated state:

- `preb` remains `[maxa, 2*maxa, 3*maxa, ..., k*maxa]`.
- `sb` remains `k*maxa`.
- `i` remains `2`.
- `ptsb` remains recalculated based on the updated `preb` and `b`.
- `maxa` remains `max(a)`.
- `n` remains the first value from the input as an integer.
- `k` remains greater than 0.
- `pb` remains the third value from the input as an integer if `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, otherwise `pb` remains `p[pb - 1]`.
- `ps` remains the fourth value from the input as an integer if `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, otherwise `ps` remains `p[ps - 1]`.
- `p` remains a list of integers read from the input.
- `a` remains a list of integers read from the input.
- `foundb` remains `True`.
- `maxb` remains recalculated based on the new `ptsb`.

The only change is that `b` now includes the value `a[pb - 1]` appended to it.
