The code snippet `preb.append(sb + b[i])` appends the value of `sb + b[i]` to the list `preb`. Given the initial state, `preb` is initially an empty list `[]`, `sb` is `0`, `i` is `-1`, and `b` is a list of integers. Since `i` is `-1`, `b[i]` refers to the last element of the list `b`. Therefore, `sb + b[i]` is `0 + b[-1]`, which is simply `b[-1]`.

After executing the code, `preb` will contain one element, which is `b[-1]`. All other variables remain unchanged, including `pres`, `sb`, `i`, `ptsb`, `maxa`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `foundb`, `founds`, `b`, `s`, `maxb`, `maxs`, and `ss`.

Output State: **`preb` is `[b[-1]]`, `pres` is `[]`, `sb` is `0`, `i` is `-1`, `ptsb` is recalculated based on the final `preb` and `b`, `maxa` is `max(a)`, `n` is the first value from the input as an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `pb` and `ps` are determined by the final values of `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `foundb` and `founds` are `True` or `False` depending on the values in `a`, `b` and `s` each have `k` elements if the loop did not break early, or fewer than `k` elements if it did, and `maxb` and `maxs` are recalculated based on the final `ptsb` and `ptss`, `ss` is `0`, `s` must have at least 1 element**.
