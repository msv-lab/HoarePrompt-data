The code snippet initializes two empty lists, `ptsb` and `ptss`. This action does not affect the values of `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, or `i`. Therefore, the output state remains the same for these variables, except for the new lists `ptsb` and `ptss`.

Output State: **`preb` is the cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is the cumulative sums of `s`, `sb` is `sum(b)`, `ss` is `sum(s)`, `i` is `len(s) - 1`, `ptsb` is `[]`, `ptss` is `[]`**.
