Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `founds` and `foundb` are boolean values; `i` is 1. If `foundb` and `founds` are both True, `b` is a list with an additional element `(k - 2) * maxa` and `s` is a list with an additional element `(k - 2) * maxa`. Otherwise, the values of `b` and `s` remain unchanged as per their initial conditions described in the precondition.**
