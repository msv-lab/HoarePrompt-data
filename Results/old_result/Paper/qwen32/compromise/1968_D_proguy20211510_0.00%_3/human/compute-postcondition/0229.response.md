The code appends the sum of `ss` and `s[i]` to the list `pres`. The variables `s`, `preb`, `i`, and `sb` are not modified by this line of code, so their initial states remain valid.

Output State: **`s` is a list that must have at least 1 element; `preb` has a new element which is the sum of `sb` and `b[i]`; `i` is incremented by 1; `sb` is updated to `sb + b[i]`; `pres` has a new element which is the sum of `ss` and `s[i]`.**
