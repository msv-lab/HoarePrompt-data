The code snippet `s.append(a[ps - 1])` appends the value at index `ps - 1` of the list `a` to the list `s`. This means that the list `s` will have an additional element, which is `a[ps - 1]`.

Given the initial state, `s` already includes `(k - 2) * maxa`. After the execution of the code, `s` will have this element plus the new element `a[ps - 1]`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`preb` is `[maxa, 2*maxa, 3*maxa, ..., k*maxa]`, `sb` is `k*maxa`, `i` is `2`, `ptsb` is recalculated based on the updated `preb` and `b`, `maxa` is `max(a)`, `n` is the first value from the input as an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `pb` is the third value from the input as an integer if `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, otherwise `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the fourth value from the input as an integer if `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, otherwise `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `foundb` is `True`, `founds` is `True`, `b` includes `(k - 2) * maxa` and `s` is recalculated to include `(k - 2) * maxa` and `a[ps - 1]`, `maxb` is recalculated based on the new `ptsb`.**
