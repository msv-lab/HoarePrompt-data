The code appends the value of `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. Given that `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa`, the list `b` will now contain two elements: `[(k - 1) * maxa, maxa]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `b` is a list containing `[(k - 1) * maxa, maxa]`; `s` is a list containing `[(k - 1) * maxa]`; `founds` is a boolean value; `i` is 0; `foundb` is True; `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa`.**
