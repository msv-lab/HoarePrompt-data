The code snippet `b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)` appends a new element to the list `b`. The value of this new element is calculated as `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. Given that `i` is initially `0`, the expression simplifies to `(k - 1) * maxa`.

After executing this code, the list `b` will have one additional element, which is `(k - 1) * maxa`. No other variables are changed by this code snippet.

Output State: **`preb` is `[maxa, 2*maxa, 3*maxa, ..., k*maxa]`, `pres` is `[s[0], s[0]+s[1], s[0]+s[1]+s[2], ..., sum(s[0:k])]`, `sb` is `k*maxa`, `ss` is `sum(s[0:k])`, `i` is `0`, `ptsb` is `[preb[0] + (k-1) * b[0], preb[1] + (k-2) * b[1], ..., preb[k-1]]`, `ptss` is `[pres[0] + (k-1) * s[0], pres[1] + (k-2) * s[1], ..., pres[k-1]]`, `maxs` is `max(ptss)`, `maxb` is `max(ptsb)`, `maxa` is `max(a)`, `b` is `[(k - 1) * maxa]`, `s` is `[]`, `foundb` is `True`, `founds` is `True`, `n` is the first value from the input as an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `pb` is the third value from the input as an integer, and `ps` is the fourth value from the input as an integer. `p` is a list of integers read from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input.`**
