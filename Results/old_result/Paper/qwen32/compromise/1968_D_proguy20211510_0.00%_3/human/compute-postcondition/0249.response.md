The code snippet `ptss.append(pres[i] + rem * s[i])` appends a new element to the list `ptss`. The new element is calculated as `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`. Given the initial state, we know that `i` is `k+1`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of the first `k` elements of `s`, and `rem` is `-2`. The new value to be appended to `ptss` will be `pres[k+1] + (-2) * s[k+1]`.

Since `pres[k+1]` is `sum(s[0:k+1])` and `rem * s[k+1]` is `-2 * s[k+1]`, the new element to be appended is `sum(s[0:k+1]) - 2 * s[k+1]`.

Output State: **`preb` is `[maxa, 2*maxa, 3*maxa, ..., k*maxa]`, `pres` is `[s[0], s[0]+s[1], s[0]+s[1]+s[2], ..., sum(s[0:k])]`, `sb` is `k*maxa`, `ss` is `sum(s[0:k])`, `i` is `k+1`, `ptsb` is `[preb[i-1] + rem * b[i-1], k*maxa - b[k], preb[k+1] - 2 * b[k+1]]`, `ptss` is `[sum(s[0:k]), sum(s[0:k]) - s[k], sum(s[0:k+1]) - 2 * s[k+1]]`, `maxs`, `maxb`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `b`, `s`, `foundb`, and `founds` remain unchanged, `rem` is `-2`.**

In natural language: The list `ptss` now includes an additional element, which is the sum of the first `k+1` elements of `s` minus twice the value of the `k+1`-th element of `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
