The provided Python code snippet initializes two boolean variables, `founds` and `foundb`, to `False`. This action does not affect any other variables in the initial state. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`. If `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` are both equal to `maxa`, then the condition `a[pb - 1] == a[ps - 1] == maxa` holds. Otherwise, if `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa`, then `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`. If `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, then `a[ps - 1]` can either be equal to `maxa` or not equal to `maxa`. `b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list, `founds` is False, `foundb` is False.**
