The code snippet `s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)` appends a new element to the list `s`. The new element is calculated as `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. Given that `i` is 2, the expression simplifies to `(k - 3) * maxa`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `founds` and `foundb` are boolean values; `i` is 2; `b` includes an additional element `(k - 3) * maxa`; `s` includes an additional element `(k - 3) * maxa`.**
