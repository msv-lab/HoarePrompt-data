The code snippet `b.append(maxa)` adds the value of `maxa` to the list `b`. Given that `foundb` is True and `b` already contains one element `[(k - 1) * maxa]`, after executing the code, `b` will contain two elements: `[(k - 1) * maxa, maxa]`.

Here is the updated state of the variables:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an integer
- `k` is an integer greater than 0
- `pb` is an integer
- `ps` is an integer
- `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`
- `b` is a list containing `[(k - 1) * maxa, maxa]`
- `s` is a list, where if `founds` is True, `s` contains one element `[(k - 1) * maxa]`
- `founds` and `foundb` are boolean values, and if both are True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement
- `i` is 0

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `b` is a list containing `[(k - 1) * maxa, maxa]`; `s` is a list, where if `founds` is True, `s` contains one element `[(k - 1) * maxa]`; `founds` and `foundb` are boolean values, and if both are True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `i` is 0.**
