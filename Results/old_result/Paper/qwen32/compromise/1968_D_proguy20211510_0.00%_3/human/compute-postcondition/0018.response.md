The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Sasha'`. The initial state provides various variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`) and their constraints, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string provided in the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('Sasha')`.
2. The string `'Sasha'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.
3. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`) are used in the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output will be the string `'Sasha'`.

Output: **Sasha**
