The code appends a new element to the list `ptsb`. The new element is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is `0`, so the new element is `preb[0] + rem * b[0]`.

Since `preb` is defined as `[sb + b[0], sb + b[1], ..., sb + b[n-1]]`, `preb[0]` is `sb + b[0]`. Therefore, the new element to be appended is `(sb + b[0]) + rem * b[0]`. Given that `rem` is `k - 1`, the new element is `(sb + b[0]) + (k - 1) * b[0]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`preb` is `[sb + b[0], sb + b[1], ..., sb + b[n-1]]`, `pres` is a list with at least one element, `sb` is `b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[n-1]`, `ss` is `s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[n-1]`, `i` is `0`, `ptsb` is `[(sb + (k - n) * b[n-1]), (sb + b[0]) + (k - 1) * b[0]]`, `ptss` is `[pres[n-1] + (k - n) * s[n-1]]`, `rem` is `k - 1`**.
