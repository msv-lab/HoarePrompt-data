### Reasoning:

Let's break down the given program and compare it with the problem requirements to determine if it's correct.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` (starting positions of Bodya and Sasha).
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program checks if both Bodya and Sasha start on the position with the maximum value in `a`. If so, it outputs "Draw".
   - If only Bodya starts on the maximum value, it outputs "Bodya".
   - If only Sasha starts on the maximum value, it outputs "Sasha".

3. **Simulation of Moves:**
   - The program simulates the moves of Bodya and Sasha for `k` turns.
   - It keeps track of the scores for each player in lists `b` and `s`.
   - If either player reaches the position with the maximum value in `a`, they stay there for the remaining turns.

4. **Calculating Scores:**
   - The program calculates the cumulative scores for Bodya and Sasha in `preb` and `pres`.
   - It then calculates the potential total scores for each player if they stay on their current position for the remaining turns in `ptsb` and `ptss`.
   - Finally, it compares the maximum potential scores for Bodya and Sasha to determine the winner.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Moves:**
   - The program does not correctly simulate the moves of Bodya and Sasha. It only checks if they reach the position with the maximum value in `a` and stays there for the remaining turns. However, the problem statement allows players to choose to stay or move to `p_x` on each turn. The program does not explore all possible moves and their outcomes.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores:**
   - The program calculates the potential scores assuming that the players will stay on their current position for the remaining turns after reaching the maximum value. However, players might still choose to move to other positions based on the values in `a` and `p`.

3. **Ignoring Optimal Strategies:**
   - The program does not consider the optimal strategies that Bodya and Sasha might use to maximize their scores. It only checks the immediate effect of reaching the maximum value in `a`.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly simulate the game and determine the winner based on the optimal strategies of Bodya and Sasha. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
