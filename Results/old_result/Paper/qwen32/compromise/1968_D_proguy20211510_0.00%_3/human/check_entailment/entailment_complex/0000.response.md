Reasoning:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" based on the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, the permutation list `p`, and the score array `a`.

2. **Immediate Draw Condition**: The program checks if both players start at positions with the maximum score in the array `a`. If so, it immediately prints "Draw" and moves to the next test case.

3. **Immediate Win Conditions**: If only Bodya or only Sasha starts at a position with the maximum score in the array `a`, the program immediately prints "Bodya" or "Sasha", respectively, and moves to the next test case.

4. **Simulation of Moves**: The program simulates the moves for both players up to `k` turns. It keeps track of the scores for each player in the lists `b` and `s`. If either player reaches a position with the maximum score in the array `a` during the simulation, it stops simulating further moves for that player and adds the maximum score for the remaining turns.

5. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix sums of the scores for both players, which are stored in the lists `preb` and `pres`.

6. **Total Score Calculation**: The program calculates the total scores for both players by adding the prefix sums and the maximum possible scores for the remaining turns, which are stored in the lists `ptsb` and `ptss`.

7. **Determine Winner**: Finally, the program compares the maximum total scores of both players and prints the winner ("Bodya" or "Sasha") or "Draw" if the scores are equal.

The program handles all edge cases and adheres to the problem constraints. It efficiently simulates the game and determines the winner based on the given rules.

Correctness: **True**
