Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining the winner is flawed. The program incorrectly assumes that once a player reaches the position with the maximum value in the array `a`, they will always win. This is not necessarily true because the game can involve multiple turns, and the players can choose to stay at their current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation `p`.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2 1 4
2 3 4 1
1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Draw
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- Bodya starts at position 1, with a score of 0.
- Sasha starts at position 4, with a score of 0.
- **Turn 1:**
  - Bodya's score becomes 1 (0 + a[1-1] = 0 + 1).
  - Sasha's score becomes 4 (0 + a[4-1] = 0 + 4).
  - Bodya moves to position 2 (p[1-1] = 2).
  - Sasha stays at position 4.
- **Turn 2:**
  - Bodya's score becomes 3 (1 + a[2-1] = 1 + 2).
  - Sasha's score becomes 8 (4 + a[4-1] = 4 + 4).
  - Bodya moves to position 3 (p[2-1] = 3).
  - Sasha stays at position 4.
- **Final Scores:**
  - Bodya: 3
  - Sasha: 8

Thus, Sasha wins. However, the program will incorrectly output "Bodya" because it incorrectly assumes that once a player reaches the maximum value in `a`, they will always win.

This demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle all possible scenarios, and therefore it is incorrect.
