The value of `mak` is updated to be equal to the value of `i`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `mak2`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `mak2` is 0, `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `mak` is `len(pans) - 1`.**
