In the provided code snippet, the only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use. The loop iterates over the range of `int(input())`, which corresponds to the number of test cases `t`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that the input provided to the function `func()` contains at least one test case. Therefore, `t` must be at least 1.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` must be at least 1**.

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once, as `int(input())` will be a positive integer, and `range(int(input()))` will contain at least one iteration.
