The value of `mak` is updated to be equal to `i`. Since `i` is 1, `mak` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of the input, `mak2` is 0, `i` is 1, `pans` is a list containing at least `n + 2` elements, and `mak` is 1. If the input is '>', then `mak` was initially set to `n + 1` but is now 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 1.**
