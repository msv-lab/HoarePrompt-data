The provided code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console immediately. However, it does not change the values of any variables or the state of the program in terms of variable assignments or conditions.

Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `i`, `pans`, and `mak` remain unchanged after the execution of `sys.stdout.flush()`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of the input, `mak2` is 0, `i` is 1, and `pans` is a list containing at least `n + 2` elements. If the input is '>', then `mak` is set to `n + 1`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.**
