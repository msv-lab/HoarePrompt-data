Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than or equal to the current value of `i`, `mak` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `mak2` is equal to the previous value of `mak`, and `pans` is a list of indices `i` for which the input was '=', with the last index `i` for which the input was '<' as the first element if any such index exists.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '>':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `mak` is `n-1` if the input was '>', otherwise `mak` remains 0, `i` is `n-1`, `mak2` is equal to the previous value of `mak`, and `pans` is a list of indices `i` for which the input was '=', with the last index `i` for which the input was '<' as the first element if any such index exists, and `pans` must have at least 2 elements. If the input was '>', `mak` is updated to `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `mak` is `n` if the input was '>', otherwise `mak` remains `n-1` if the input was '>', or `mak` remains 0 if the input was not '>', `mak2` is equal to the previous value of `mak`, and `pans` is a list of indices `i` for which the input was '=', with the last index `i` for which the input was '<' as the first element if any such index exists, and `pans` must have at least 3 elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `mak` is `i + 1` if the input was '>', otherwise `mak` remains its previous value, `mak2` is equal to the previous value of `mak`, `pans` is a list of indices `i` for which the input was '=', with the last index `i` for which the input was '<' as the first element if any such index exists, and `pans` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is `i + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
