The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 and should still be less than `n`. However, since `i` is already equal to `n`, the loop condition `i < n` will not be satisfied, and the loop will not execute again. Therefore, no adjustment is needed to make the loop execute one more time because the loop will terminate after this iteration.

Since the loop will terminate, the state remains the same for the next iteration, which is effectively the end of the loop.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was '<', `i` is `n`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `s` is the input string. If `s` was '<', `pans` is `[n]`. If `s` was '=', `pans` is `[n-1, n]`. If `s` was neither '=' nor '<', `pans` is `[n-1]` if `s` was '<' (which is already covered), or remains an empty list.**
