Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is at least 1.
2. `n` must be greater than 0.
3. `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was '<'.
4. `i` is `n-1`.
5. `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
6. `pans` is an empty list.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is straightforward and will print the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` again.
- From the initial state, we know that `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
- `i` is explicitly defined as `n-1`.

### Values:
- `mak`: This variable holds the largest `i` for which the input was '<'. Since we don't have the exact input, we can't determine the exact value of `mak`, but we know it's an integer.
- `mak2`: This variable is explicitly defined as `mak`, so it will have the same value as `mak`.
- `i`: This variable is explicitly defined as `n-1`. Since `n` is greater than 0, `i` will be at least 0.

### Output:
The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` again.

Given the information, the output will be:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] [n-1] [mak] (where mak is the largest i for which the input was '<' and n is greater than 0)**
