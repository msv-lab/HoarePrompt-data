To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, len(pans))`. This means the loop will iterate over the indices of `pans` starting from 1 up to, but not including, `len(pans)`.

Let's analyze the requirements for the loop to execute:

1. **`pans`**: The list `pans` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute. This is because the loop starts from index 1 and goes up to `len(pans)`, so `len(pans)` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute once.

2. **`i`**: The variable `i` is the loop variable and is set to 1 at the start of the loop. Before the loop starts, `i` is set to `n`. However, since `i` is initialized in the loop head, we don't need to adjust `i` before the loop starts. The loop head will set `i` to 1.

3. **Other Variables**: The variables `t`, `n`, `mak`, and `mak2` are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the length of `pans`.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of the input, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is the same as `mak`, `i` is `n`, and `pans` is a list containing at least 2 elements**
