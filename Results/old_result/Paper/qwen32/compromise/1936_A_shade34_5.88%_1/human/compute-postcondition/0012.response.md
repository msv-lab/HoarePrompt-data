The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `mak`. Given that `i` is incremented by 1 before this line in the initial state, `mak` will now hold the value of `i` after this increment.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `mak` is `i`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

In simpler terms, `mak` is updated to the new value of `i`, which has already been incremented by 1. All other conditions and variable states remain the same.
