The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `mak`. Given the initial state, `i` is equal to `n`. Therefore, `mak` will now be equal to `n`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, `s`, `pans`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is `n`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `s` is the new input string, `pans` is `[n]` if the new `s` was '<', `[n-1, n]` if the new `s` was '=', or `[n-1]` if the new `s` was neither '=' nor '<' and was not previously '<'.**
