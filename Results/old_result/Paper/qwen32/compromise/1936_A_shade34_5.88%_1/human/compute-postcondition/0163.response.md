The value of `mak` is assigned the value of `i`. Since `i` is `len(pans) + 1`, `mak` will now hold that value. The other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `len(pans) + 1`, `mak2` is 0, `i` is `len(pans) + 1`, `mak` is `len(pans) + 1`**.
