The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(pans) - 1` and `n` is greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. Since `i` was `len(pans) - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` should be `len(pans)`. For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than `len(pans)`.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `len(pans)`, `mak2` is 0, `i` is `len(pans)`**
