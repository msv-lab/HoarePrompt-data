The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the length of `pans`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `pans`. If `i` is less than the length of `pans`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the last value that made the loop execute, and since the loop is iterating from `1` to `len(pans) - 1`, the next value of `i` should be `i + 1`. Given that `pans` must have at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again if `i + 1` is less than `len(pans)`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `mak` is `n` if the input was '>', otherwise `mak` remains `n-1` if the input was '>', or `mak` remains 0 if the input was not '>', `mak2` is equal to the previous value of `mak`, and `pans` is a list of indices `i` for which the input was '=', with the last index `i` for which the input was '<' as the first element if any such index exists, and `pans` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is `i + 1`**
