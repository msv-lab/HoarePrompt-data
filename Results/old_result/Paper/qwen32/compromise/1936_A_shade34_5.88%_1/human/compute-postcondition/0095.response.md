The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The initial value of `i` is `n-1`, which does not affect the ability of the loop to start executing, but it is important to note that the loop will reassign `i` starting from 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

The states `t`, `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` or `0` if no such `i` existed, `mak2` is the same as `mak`, `i` is `n-1`, and `pans` is an empty list**
