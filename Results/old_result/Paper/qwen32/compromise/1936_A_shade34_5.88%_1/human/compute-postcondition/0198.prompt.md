Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of the new input minus 1, `mak2` is the largest i for which the input was <, `i` is n-1, `mak` is the largest i for which the input was <, `pans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    s = str(input())
    if s == '<':
        mak = i
        pans = [i]
    elif s == '=':
        pans.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest i for which the input was `<`, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is `n-1` if `s` is `'<'` otherwise `mak` is the largest i for which the input was `<`, `pans` is a list containing the single element `i` if `s` is `'<'`, `pans` is a list containing the element `n-1` if `s` is `'='`, and `pans` remains an empty list if `s` is neither `'<'` nor `'='`, `s` is the input string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest i for which the input was `<`, `i` is `n-2`, `mak` is `n-2` if `s` is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` is the largest i for which the input was `<` before the if statement. If `s` is `'<'`, `pans` contains the single element `i`. If `s` is `'='`, `pans` contains the elements `i` and `n-1`. If `s` is neither `'<'` nor `'='`, `pans` remains unchanged from its initial state, which could be a list containing `i` if `s` was `'<'` initially, a list containing `n-1` if `s` was `'='` initially, or an empty list if `s` was neither `'<'` nor `'='` initially. `s` is the new input string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest i for which the input was `<`. `i` is `n-1`. If `s` is `'<'`, `mak` is `n-1` and `pans` is `[i]`. If `s` is `'='`, `mak` is `n-2` if the previous `s` was `'<'`, otherwise `mak` is the largest i for which the input was `<` before the if statement, and `pans` is `[i, n-1, i]`. If `s` is neither `'<'` nor `'='`, `mak` is `n-2` if the previous `s` was `'<'`, otherwise `mak` is the largest i for which the input was `<` before the if statement, and `pans` contains the original elements with one additional element `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
