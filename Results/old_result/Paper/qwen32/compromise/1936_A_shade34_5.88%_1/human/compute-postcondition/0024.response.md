The code snippet provided is `sys.stdout.flush()`, which is a function call that flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream. This operation does not change the values of any variables in the program; it merely ensures that any buffered output is written to the console immediately.

Given that the provided code snippet does not modify any of the variables (`t`, `n`, `mak`, `i`, `mak2`, `pans`), the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was '<', `i` is `n-1`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is an empty list**.
