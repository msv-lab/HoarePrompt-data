To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t`: At least 1 (but its exact value is not specified)
   - `n`: The integer value of the new input minus 1
   - `mak2`: The largest index `i` for which the input was `<`
   - `i`: Set to `n-1`
   - `mak`: Set to 0
   - `pans`: A list containing at least 2 elements where the input was `=` and the last index `i` where the input was `<` (if any)

2. **Understanding `pans`:**
   - `pans` is a list with at least two elements.
   - The first element of `pans` is the index where the input was `=`.
   - The second element of `pans` is the last index `i` where the input was `<` (if any).

3. **Understanding the indices:**
   - `mak` is set to 0.
   - `i` is set to `n-1`.

4. **The print statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])`.

5. **Substituting the values:**
   - `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]`, which is the index where the input was `=`.
   - `pans[i]` is `pans[n-1]`. Since `n` is the integer value of the new input minus 1, `i` is the second-to-last element of the `pans` list.

6. **Output format:**
   - The output will be `?`, followed by the first element of `pans` twice, and the last element of `pans` twice.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[n-1]] [pans[n-1]] (where pans[0] is the index where the input was '=' and pans[n-1] is the last index where the input was '<' if any, otherwise it's the second element of pans)**
