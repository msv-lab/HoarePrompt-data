Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be at least 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `mak` is 0.
- The variable `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we need to assume it is not present or should be considered undefined in the context of this problem.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
- The first argument to `print` is a literal string `'?'`.
- The second and third arguments are both `mak`, which is explicitly defined as `0`.
- The fourth and fifth arguments are both `i`. However, `i` is not defined in the initial state, which means it is undefined in this context. In Python, if an undefined variable is referenced, it will raise a `NameError`. But since the task asks us to describe the output based on the given information and not to execute the code, we will assume `i` is intended to be included in the output as is, without a specific value.

### Output:
Given the above analysis, the output will be:
- The literal string `'?'`
- The value of `mak` which is `0`
- The value of `mak` again which is `0`
- The undefined variable `i`
- The undefined variable `i` again

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is undefined)**
