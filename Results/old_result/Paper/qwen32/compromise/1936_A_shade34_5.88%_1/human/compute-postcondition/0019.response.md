Output State: **t is at least 1, n is greater than or equal to the current value of i, mak is the largest i for which the input was '<', and i is n-1.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains at least 1, `n` is at least as large as the number of iterations, `mak` holds the largest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, and `i` will have reached `n-1` by the end of the loop.
