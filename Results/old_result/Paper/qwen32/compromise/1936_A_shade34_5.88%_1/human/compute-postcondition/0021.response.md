The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `pans`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables `t`, `n`, `mak`, or `i`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than or equal to the current value of `i`, `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was '<', `i` is `n-1`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is an empty list.**
