The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value, and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `mak` is `i` if the input string is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and `i` is `i + 2`**
