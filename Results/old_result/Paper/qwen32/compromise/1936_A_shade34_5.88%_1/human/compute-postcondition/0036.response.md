The provided code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the internal buffer of the standard output. This operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was '<', `i` is `n`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `s` is the input string. If `s` is equal to '<', `pans` is `[n-1]`. If `s` is equal to '=', `pans` is `[n-1]`. Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list.**
