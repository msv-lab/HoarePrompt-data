The provided code snippet includes `sys.stdout.flush()`, which is a function call that flushes the output buffer to the terminal. This does not affect the values of any variables in the program. Therefore, none of the variables `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `i`, `mak`, or `pans` will change their values.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest i for which the input was <, `i` is n-1, `mak` is the largest i for which the input was <, `pans` is an empty list.**
