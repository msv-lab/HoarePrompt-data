Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine the printed output.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. `t` is at least 1. (This information is not directly used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this context.)
2. `n` is greater than `i + 2`. (Again, this information is not directly used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this context.)
3. `mak` is set to `i` if the input string is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0.
4. `i` is incremented by 2 (`i = i + 2`).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `mak`:**
   - If the input string is `'<'`, then `mak = i`.
   - If the input string is not `'<'`, then `mak = 0`.
   
2. **Determine the value of `i`:**
   - `i` is incremented by 2 (`i = i + 2`).

### Output Analysis:
- The print statement will output the following values:
  - `'?'` (a literal string)
  - `mak` (which is either `i` or `0` based on the input string)
  - `mak` (repeated, so it will be the same as the previous `mak`)
  - `i` (which is `i + 2` after the increment)
  - `i` (repeated, so it will be the same as the previous `i`)

### Final Output:
- If the input string is `'<'`, `mak` will be the initial value of `i`. After the increment, `i` will be `i + 2`.
- If the input string is not `'<'`, `mak` will be `0`. After the increment, `i` will be `i + 2`.

### Conclusion:
The output will depend on the value of the input string. We will describe both cases:

1. **If the input string is `'<'`:**
   - `mak = i`
   - `i = i + 2`
   - Output: `? i i (i + 2) (i + 2)`

2. **If the input string is not `'<'`:**
   - `mak = 0`
   - `i = i + 2`
   - Output: `? 0 0 (i + 2) (i + 2)`

Since we do not have the exact value of the input string, we will provide the output in a format that reflects both possibilities.

Output: **? [mak] [mak] [i + 2] [i + 2] (where mak is i if the input string is '<' otherwise 0, and i is i + 2)**
