Let's break down the given information and determine the values of the variables `mak`, `mak2`, and `i` based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State:
- `t` is at least 1.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` or `0` if no such `i` existed.
- `mak2` is the same as `mak`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `pans` is an empty list.

### Variables to Determine:
1. **`mak`**: The highest value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` or `0` if no such `i` existed.
   - Since we do not have any specific information about the inputs that were processed, we can only assume the worst-case scenario based on the given information. If no input was `'<'`, then `mak` would be `0`.

2. **`mak2`**: The same as `mak`.
   - Given that `mak2` is the same as `mak`, `mak2` would also be `0` if no input was `'<'`.

3. **`i`**: This is `n-1`.
   - Since `n` must be greater than 0, the smallest possible value for `n` is 1. Therefore, the smallest possible value for `i` is `1-1 = 0`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Output Calculation:
- The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` again.

Given the worst-case scenario where no input was `'<'`, the values are:
- `mak = 0`
- `mak2 = 0`
- `i = n-1` (which is at least `0` if `n` is at least `1`)

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 0 0**
