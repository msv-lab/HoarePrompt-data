The function `func()` does not take any input parameters directly. Instead, it interacts with an external system to receive the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), and for each test case, it receives an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) followed by a hidden permutation `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` of the integers from 0 to n-1. The function can make queries to the system by printing lines in the format "? a b c d" where 0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n, and it will receive a response of "<", "=", or ">" based on the comparison of the bitwise OR operations on the elements of the permutation. The function must find two indices i and j such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized and print the result in the format "! i j" without exceeding 3n queries per test case. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
