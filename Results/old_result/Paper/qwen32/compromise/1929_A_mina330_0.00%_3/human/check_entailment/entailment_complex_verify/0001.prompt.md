You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        print(kq)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the array a contains n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        kq = 0
        
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        
        print(kq)
        
    #State: `ntest` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `ntest` ≤ 500, `itest` is `ntest - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `kq` is the sum of `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `len(a) // 2 - 1`, `i` is `len(a) // 2 - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It sorts the list and calculates the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on, up to the middle of the list. The result for each test case is printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The beauty of the array is calculated as:

\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

To maximize this beauty, we need to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences. This can be achieved by arranging the elements in such a way that the largest elements alternate with the smallest elements.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the beauty, we can sort the array and then pair the largest elements with the smallest elements in an alternating manner. For example, if the sorted array is \([a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]\), we can rearrange it as \([a_1, a_n, a_2, a_{n-1}, ...]\).

The maximum beauty can be calculated by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest, and so on.

### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code sorts the array and then calculates the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest, and so on, up to the middle of the array. This is a correct approach to maximize the beauty of the array.

Here's the breakdown of the code:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the length of the array and the elements of the array.
3. Sort the array.
4. Calculate the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest, and so on.
5. Print the result for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the approach to maximize the beauty of the array. Therefore, the program is correct.
