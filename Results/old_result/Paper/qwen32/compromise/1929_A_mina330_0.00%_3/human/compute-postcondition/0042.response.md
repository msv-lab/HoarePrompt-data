Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It sorts the list and calculates the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on, up to the middle of the list. The result for each test case is printed.**
