The code snippet sorts the list `a`. The values of `ntest`, `itest`, and `n` remain unchanged. The list `a` is updated to be in non-decreasing order.

Output State: **`ntest` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `ntest` â‰¤ 500, `itest` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.**
