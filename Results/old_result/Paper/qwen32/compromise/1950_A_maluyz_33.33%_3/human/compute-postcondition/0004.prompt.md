You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: - After all iterations, the only variable that changes is the output to the console (standard output). The variable `t` remains unchanged as it only determines the number of iterations.
    #   - The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are re-assigned in each iteration and do not retain their values after the loop completes.
    #
    #Thus, the output state is solely defined by the series of printed strings ('STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE') that occur during each iteration of the loop. Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact sequence of printed strings, but we know that `t` remains unchanged.
    #
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, it accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9. The function returns the maximum of the three integers for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
