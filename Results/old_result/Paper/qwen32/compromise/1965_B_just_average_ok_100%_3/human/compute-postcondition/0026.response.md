The given code snippet redefines the `nums` list to contain powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\). This means `nums` will now be `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `idx`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` (excluding the newly added elements) that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if `k` is greater than 1048576.**
