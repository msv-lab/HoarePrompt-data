The code assigns the value of `i - 1` to the variable `idx`. Given that `i` is 4, `idx` will be `4 - 1`, which equals 3. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `i` is 4, `idx` is 3**.
