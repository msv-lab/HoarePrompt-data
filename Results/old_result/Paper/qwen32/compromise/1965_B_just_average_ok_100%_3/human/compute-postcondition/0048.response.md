The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times based on the input value. The loop will execute as many times as the integer provided by the input.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `k` is the second integer from the input
- `nums` is a predefined list
- `idx` is 20

Since the loop uses `for _ in range(int(input())):`, the state of `_` does not matter because it is reassigned at the start of each iteration. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are iterations left based on the input value.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider that the loop counter (which is represented by `_`) will be incremented by 1. However, since `_` is not used within the loop, its exact value is irrelevant.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same except for the implicit increment of the loop counter, which doesn't affect the provided variables.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, k - 1048576, k + 1, 2*k - 1048575], `idx` is 20**
