The code removes the element at position `1 << idx` from the list `nums`. Given `idx` is 20, `1 << 20` equals 1048576. Therefore, the element 1048576 is removed from the list `nums`.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is the first integer from the input, k is the second integer from the input, nums is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, k - 1048576, k + 1, 2*k - 1048575], idx is 20.**
