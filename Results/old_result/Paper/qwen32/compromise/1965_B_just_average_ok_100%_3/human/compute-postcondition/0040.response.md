Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], and `i` is 4. If `nums[i] > k`, then `idx` is set to 3 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no changes are made to `idx` or the loop continues.**
