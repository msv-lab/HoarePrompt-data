The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to the length of `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was some value such that it had just completed an iteration where `i` was less than the length of `nums`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Given that `nums` contains 21 elements (from 1 to 1048576), `i` must be less than 21 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]. If `nums[i]` is greater than `k`, then `idx` is set to `i - 1`. Otherwise, `idx` remains `-1`. `i` is incremented by 1.**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `i` is incremented by 1.**

Since `i` was 3 at the end of the last iteration (as per the example logic), it should now be 4 for the next iteration.
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `i` is 4.**

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we'll generalize it as follows:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `i` is incremented by 1.**

If `i` was `x` at the end of the last iteration, it should now be `x + 1`.
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `i` is `i + 1`.**

Since we need to specify a concrete state, let's assume `i` was 3 at the end of the last iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `i` is 4.**

But to be general:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `i` is incremented by 1.**

For the sake of concreteness in the answer:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `i` is 4.**
