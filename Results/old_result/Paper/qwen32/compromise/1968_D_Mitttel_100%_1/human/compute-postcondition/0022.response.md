To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables `mx`, `cur`, `k`, `s`, and `vis` evolve with each iteration.

The loop continues until `vis[s]` is `1` (indicating that state `s` has been visited before) or `k` becomes `0`. Given the initial state and the first three iterations, we can infer the following:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a`: List of `n` integers.
   - `p`: Permutation of integers from `1` to `n`.
   - `s`: Tuple `(P_B, P_S)`, but `s` is used as an index, so it should be an integer from `0` to `n-1`.
   - `k`: Integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).
   - `mx`: `0`.
   - `cur`: `0`.
   - `vis`: List of `n` zeros.

2. **Loop Body:**
   - Mark the current state `s` as visited (`vis[s] = 1`).
   - Update `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`.
   - Increment `cur` by `a[s]`.
   - Decrement `k` by `1`.
   - Update `s` to `p[s]`.

Given the outputs after the first three iterations:
- After 1st iteration: `s` becomes `p[0]`, `k` becomes `k-1`, `mx` is updated, `cur` is `a[0]`, and `vis[0]` is set to `1`.
- After 2nd iteration: `s` becomes `p[s]`, `k` becomes `k-2`, `mx` is updated, `cur` is `a[0] + a[s]`, and `vis[s]` is set to `1`.
- After 3rd iteration: `s` becomes `p[s]`, `k` becomes `k-3`, `mx` is updated, `cur` is `a[0] + 2 * a[s]`, and `vis[s]` is set to `1`.

The loop will terminate when `s` is visited again (indicating a cycle) or `k` becomes `0`.

**Final Output State:**
- `a`: Remains unchanged.
- `p`: Remains unchanged.
- `s`: The final state index after the loop terminates.
- `k`: `0` if the loop terminated because `k` reached `0`, or the remaining `k` if the loop terminated because `s` was revisited.
- `mx`: The maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during the loop.
- `cur`: The accumulated sum of `a[s]` values visited.
- `vis`: List indicating which states have been visited.

The loop terminates when either `k` becomes `0` or a cycle is detected (i.e., `vis[s]` is `1` for an already visited state `s`).

**Output State: **`a` remains the same, `p` remains the same, `s` is the last state before termination, `k` is `0` if all iterations were used, otherwise the remaining `k`, `mx` is the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered, `cur` is the sum of `a[s]` values visited, and `vis` indicates the visited states.**

In natural language: The final output state is where the list `a` and permutation `p` remain unchanged. The variable `s` holds the last state index before the loop terminates. The variable `k` is either `0` if all iterations were used or the remaining value if a cycle was detected. The variable `mx` holds the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during the loop. The variable `cur` is the total sum of the values of `a[s]` for the states visited. The variable `vis` is a list indicating which states have been visited during the loop execution.
