The code snippet `s = p[s]` updates the value of `s` to the value at the index `s` in the list `p`. Given the initial state, `s` is initially 0. Therefore, `s` will be updated to `p[0]`.

Here is the updated state of the variables:
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\).
- `p` remains a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.
- `s` is now equal to `p[0]`.
- `k` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9 - 1\).
- `n` remains the length of the list `p`.
- `mx` remains `max(0, cur + k * a[0])`.
- `cur` remains `a[0]`.
- `vis` remains a list of `n` zeros with `vis[0]` set to 1.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\); `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`; `s` is `p[0]`; `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9 - 1\); `n` is the length of the list `p`; `mx` is `max(0, cur + k * a[0])`; `cur` is `a[0]`; `vis` is a list of `n` zeros with `vis[0]` set to 1.**
