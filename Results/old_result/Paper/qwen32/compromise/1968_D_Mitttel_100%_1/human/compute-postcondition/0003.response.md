The code snippet creates a list `vis` of length `n` where each element is initialized to `0`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `p`, `s`, `k`, `mx`, or `cur`. The only change is the creation of the new list `vis`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9, `p` is a list of n integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `s` is a tuple of two integers (P_B, P_S) where 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^9, and `n` is the length of the list `p`; `mx` is 0; `cur` is 0; `vis` is a list of n zeros.**
