The code snippet updates the value of `mx` by comparing its current value with `cur + k * a[s]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given:
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\)
- `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`
- `s` is `p[s]`
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9 - 1\) and `k` is now `k - 1` but must be greater than 0
- `n` is the length of the list `p`
- `mx` is `max(max(0, a[0] + k * a[0]), a[0] + k * a[s])`
- `cur` is `a[0] + a[s]`
- `vis` is a list of `n` zeros with `vis[0]` set to 1 and `vis[s]` set to 1

The new value of `mx` will be the maximum of its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\); `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`; `s` is `p[s]`; `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9 - 1\) and `k` is now `k - 1` but must be greater than 0; `n` is the length of the list `p`; `mx` is `max(mx, cur + k * a[s])`; `cur` is `a[0] + a[s]`; `vis` is a list of `n` zeros with `vis[0]` set to 1 and `vis[s]` set to 1.**
