You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

    Sasha
    Sasha
    Sasha
    Bodya
    
Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    #The program returns mx, which is the maximum value of cur + k * a[s] encountered



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains a few issues that could lead to incorrect results. One primary issue is the decrementing of the elements in the `p` and `a` lists by 1. The problem description specifies that the permutation `p` and array `a` are 1-indexed, meaning that indices start from 1. By decrementing these values, the code is treating them as 0-indexed, which could lead to incorrect results.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Indexing Issue**:
   - The lines `p[i] -= 1` and `a[i] -= 1` convert the 1-indexed inputs to 0-indexed. However, the rest of the code does not account for this change correctly.
   - The function `func_1` uses the values in `p` and `a` directly without adjusting for the 0-indexing, which could lead to incorrect behavior.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the score by multiplying `a[s]` with `k` and adding it to `cur`. However, the problem description specifies that the score should increase by `a_x` on each turn, not `k * a_x`.
   - The line `mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])` should be `mx = max(mx, cur + a[s])` because the score should increase by `a_x` on each turn, not `k * a_x`.

3. **Potential Infinite Loop**:
   - The while loop condition `while not vis[s] and k > 0` is correct in terms of avoiding revisiting a position. However, the decrementing of `k` and updating of `s` should ensure that `k` reaches 0 or a cycle is detected.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    A = func_1(a, p, pb - 1, k)
    B = func_1(a, p, ps - 1, k)
    if A == B:
        print('Draw')
    elif A > B:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')

def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        mx = max(mx, cur + a[s])
        cur += a[s]
        k -= 1
        s = p[s] - 1  # Correctly adjust for 1-indexing
    return mx
```

In the corrected version, the score is incremented by `a[s]` on each turn, and the position `s` is correctly adjusted for 1-indexing when updating to `p[s] - 1`. This ensures that the program works as expected for all potential cases.
