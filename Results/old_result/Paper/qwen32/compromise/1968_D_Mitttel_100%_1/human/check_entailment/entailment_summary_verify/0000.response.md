### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment against the problem description and function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- **Permutation and Array**: The input includes a permutation `p` and an array `a`, both 1-indexed.
- **Game Rules**: Players start at given positions and move according to the permutation `p`, collecting scores based on the array `a`.
- **Objective**: Determine the winner after `k` turns, or if it's a draw.

#### Program Code Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case:
1. Reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`.
2. Reads the permutation `p` and array `a`.
3. Adjusts `p` and `a` to be 0-indexed by decrementing each element by 1.
4. Calls `func_1` for both players to calculate their maximum possible scores.
5. Compares the scores and prints the winner or "Draw".

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- **Parameters**: `a` (array), `p` (permutation), `s` (starting position, 0-indexed), `k` (number of turns).
- **Logic**:
  - Initializes `mx` (maximum score), `cur` (current score), and `vis` (visited positions).
  - Iterates through the permutation, updating the current score by adding `a[s]` on each turn.
  - Tracks the maximum score encountered.
  - Stops when `k` turns are completed or a cycle is detected (i.e., revisiting a position).

#### Original Assessment Summary:
- **Indexing Issue**: The program converts `p` and `a` to 0-indexed but does not adjust the permutation `p` correctly when updating positions.
- **Incorrect Calculation of Scores**: The assessment claims the score should be incremented by `a[s]` on each turn, not `k * a[s]`.
- **Potential Infinite Loop**: The loop condition is correct, but the position update should account for 1-indexing.

#### Detailed Evaluation:
1. **Indexing Issue**:
   - The conversion to 0-indexing is correct (`p[i] -= 1` and `a[i] -= 1`).
   - However, when updating the position `s` in the loop, `s = p[s]` should be `s = p[s] - 1` to account for the 0-indexing. This adjustment is necessary because `p` was originally 1-indexed.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores**:
   - The function correctly increments `cur` by `a[s]` on each turn.
   - The calculation `mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])` is incorrect because it assumes the player can stay in the same position for the remaining `k` turns, which is not the case. The correct calculation should be `mx = max(mx, cur + a[s])`.

3. **Potential Infinite Loop**:
   - The loop condition `while not vis[s] and k > 0` is correct and prevents infinite loops by detecting cycles.
   - However, the position update should correctly account for 0-indexing.

#### Corrected Code:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    A = func_1(a, p, pb - 1, k)
    B = func_1(a, p, ps - 1, k)
    if A == B:
        print('Draw')
    elif A > B:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')

def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        mx = max(mx, cur + a[s])
        cur += a[s]
        k -= 1
        s = p[s] - 1  # Correctly adjust for 1-indexing
    return mx
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is mostly accurate in identifying the issues, but the specific corrections required are as follows:
- The position update in `func_1` should be `s = p[s] - 1` to account for the 0-indexing.
- The score calculation should be `mx = max(mx, cur + a[s])` to correctly reflect the score increment.

Given these necessary corrections, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the problems, but the provided code does not implement these corrections.

**Final: False**
