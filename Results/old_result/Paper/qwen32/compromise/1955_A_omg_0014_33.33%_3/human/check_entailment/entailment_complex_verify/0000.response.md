Let's analyze the problem and the program step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to determine the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts where:
- The price of one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The price of two yogurts under promotion is `b` burles.

The optimal strategy involves:
1. Calculating how many pairs of yogurts (`n // 2`) can be bought at the promotional price.
2. Calculating the cost for these pairs.
3. Calculating the cost for any remaining yogurt (`n % 2`).
4. Summing the costs from the pairs and the remaining yogurt to get the total minimum cost.

### Program Analysis

The given program has the following logic:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        d = c / 2
        
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
```

### Annotations and Original Assessment

The annotations provided state:
- `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price of two yogurts.
- The function calculates and prints either `a * b` or `a * (c / 2)`, rounded to the nearest integer, depending on which value is smaller.

### Issues in the Program

The program has a few critical issues:
1. The variable `c` is used instead of `b` for the price of two yogurts.
2. The logic `if a * b < a * d` is incorrect. The correct comparison should be between the cost of buying `n` yogurts individually (`n * a`) and the cost of buying as many pairs as possible plus any remaining yogurt.
3. The calculation `d = c / 2` is not used correctly. It seems the intention was to use `b` instead of `c`.

### Correct Approach

The correct approach should be:
1. Calculate the number of pairs (`n // 2`).
2. Calculate the cost for these pairs (`(n // 2) * b`).
3. Calculate the cost for the remaining yogurt (`(n % 2) * a`).
4. Sum the costs to get the total minimum cost.

### Example Test Cases

Let's consider the test cases provided in the problem statement:

1. **Input:** `2 5 9`
   - Pairs: `2 // 2 = 1`
   - Cost for pairs: `1 * 9 = 9`
   - Remaining: `2 % 2 = 0`
   - Total cost: `9`

2. **Input:** `3 5 9`
   - Pairs: `3 // 2 = 1`
   - Cost for pairs: `1 * 9 = 9`
   - Remaining: `3 % 2 = 1`
   - Cost for remaining: `1 * 5 = 5`
   - Total cost: `9 + 5 = 14`

3. **Input:** `3 5 11`
   - Pairs: `3 // 2 = 1`
   - Cost for pairs: `1 * 11 = 11`
   - Remaining: `3 % 2 = 1`
   - Cost for remaining: `1 * 5 = 5`
   - Total cost: `11 + 5 = 16` (not 15, as the program incorrectly calculates)

4. **Input:** `4 5 11`
   - Pairs: `4 // 2 = 2`
   - Cost for pairs: `2 * 11 = 22`
   - Remaining: `4 % 2 = 0`
   - Total cost: `22` (not 20, as the program incorrectly calculates)

### Conclusion

The original assessment is **correct**. The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given promotion. The logic and calculations in the program are incorrect, and a revised approach is needed.

**Final: False**
