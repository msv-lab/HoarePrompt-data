You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. For each test case, it calculates and prints either `a * b` or `a * (c / 2)`, rounded to the nearest integer, depending on which value is smaller.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `a`, `b`, and `c`. Here, `a` is the price of one yogurt, `b` is the number of yogurts to be bought, and `c` is the price for two yogurts during the promotion.

2. **Variable Naming:**
   - There is a discrepancy in the variable names used in the problem statement and the program. In the problem statement, `n` is the number of yogurts to be bought, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price for two yogurts. However, in the program, `a`, `b`, and `c` are used, which seems to map to `b`, `a`, and `c` respectively in the problem statement. This is a misinterpretation in the code.
   - According to the problem statement, the correct mapping should be: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), `b` (price of two yogurts).

3. **Logic for Minimum Cost Calculation:**
   - The program calculates `d` as `c / 2`, which seems to be an attempt to calculate the average price per yogurt during the promotion. However, this is not the correct approach to solve the problem.
   - The comparison `if a * b < a * d` is incorrect because it compares the cost of buying `b` yogurts at the regular price with the cost of buying `b` yogurts at the average promotion price per yogurt, which does not make sense in the context of the problem.
   - The correct approach should be to determine how many pairs of yogurts can be bought at the promotion price and how many yogurts will be left to buy at the regular price.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price: `pairs = n // 2`.
   - Calculate the number of yogurts that will be left to buy at the regular price: `remaining = n % 2`.
   - The total cost can be calculated as: `total_cost = pairs * b + remaining * a`.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts. It incorrectly calculates and compares costs and does not properly handle the number of yogurts to be bought at regular price versus the promotion price.
