### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the function summary provided.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Maxim needs to buy exactly `n` yogurts.
- The price of one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The price of two yogurts during the promotion is `b` burles.
- The goal is to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend.

#### Program Code Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, there seems to be a misinterpretation of the variables:
- `a` in the problem statement is the price of one yogurt.
- `b` in the problem statement is the price of two yogurts during the promotion.
- `c` in the problem statement is not mentioned and seems to be a misinterpretation in the code provided.

The code calculates `d` as `c / 2` and then compares `a * b` with `a * d`. This comparison does not make sense in the context of the problem because:
- `a * b` would be the cost of buying `b` yogurts at the regular price, which is incorrect.
- `a * d` is an attempt to calculate the cost of buying `b` yogurts at the average promotion price per yogurt, which is also incorrect.

The correct approach should be:
1. Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price: `pairs = n // 2`.
2. Calculate the number of yogurts that will be left to buy at the regular price: `remaining = n % 2`.
3. Compute the total cost: `total_cost = pairs * b + remaining * a`.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The function summary states that the function calculates and prints either `a * b` or `a * (c / 2)`, rounded to the nearest integer, depending on which value is smaller. This summary does not align with the logic required to solve the problem correctly.

### Correct Implementation:
Here is the correct implementation based on the problem description:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        total_cost = pairs * b + remaining * a
        print(total_cost)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts. The provided function summary does not accurately describe the necessary logic either. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
