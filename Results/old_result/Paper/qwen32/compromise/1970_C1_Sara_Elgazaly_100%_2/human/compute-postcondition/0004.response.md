To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how it modifies the variables.

The loop runs `x-1` times, and in each iteration, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input. It then appends `b` to the list in the dictionary `lst` at the key `a`, and appends `a` to the list in the dictionary `rev` at the key `b`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what happens:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `lst` and `rev` are `defaultdict` objects with lists as their default factory.
   - `x` is an integer read from the input, which determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.
   - `n`, `t`, the tree edges, and the starting node `u_1` are also given but are not modified by the loop.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each of the `x-1` iterations, the loop reads two integers `a` and `b`.
   - It updates `lst[a]` by appending `b` to the list at key `a`.
   - It updates `rev[b]` by appending `a` to the list at key `b`.

After the loop finishes, the dictionaries `lst` and `rev` will have been populated with the relationships defined by the `x-1` pairs of integers read from the input.

**Output State**: The state of `lst` and `rev` will reflect the directed relationships between the nodes as defined by the `x-1` pairs of integers. The other variables (`n`, `t`, the tree edges, and `u_1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` and `rev` are defaultdicts where `lst[a]` contains all `b` such that a pair (a, b) was read, and `rev[b]` contains all `a` such that a pair (a, b) was read. All other variables remain unchanged.**
