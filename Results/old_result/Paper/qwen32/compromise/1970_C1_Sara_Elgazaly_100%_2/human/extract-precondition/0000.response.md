Precondition: **n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is an integer and t=1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing the edges of the tree, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the starting node of the stone. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.**
