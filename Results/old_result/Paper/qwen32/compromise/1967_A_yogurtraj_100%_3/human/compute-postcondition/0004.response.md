The code assigns the first element of the sorted list `a` to the variable `r`. Therefore, the value of `r` is now the smallest element in the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input; `r` is the smallest element in the list `a`.**
