Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` remains the same (value not provided, not needed for this calculation).
- `n` remains the same (value not provided, but used in the calculation).
- `a` remains the same (value not provided, but `a[n - 1]` is used in the calculation).
- `rem` is 0.
- `y` is 0.
- `ii` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration (value not provided, not needed for this calculation).
- `k` is 0.
- `r` is `a[n - 1]`.
- The condition `k != 0` is false (which is consistent with `k` being 0).

### Calculation:
The print statement is:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)
```

Substituting the known values:
- `r` is `a[n - 1]`.
- `rem` is 0.
- `y` is 0.
- `k` is 0 (though `k` is not used in the print statement).

So the expression simplifies to:
```python
print((a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1 + 0 + 0)
```
Which further simplifies to:
```python
print((a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1)
```

### Explanation:
- `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the list `a`.
- `(a[n - 1] - 1)` subtracts 1 from the last element of the list `a`.
- Multiplying the result by `n` scales it by the value of `n`.
- Adding 1 at the end shifts the result by 1.

### Final Output:
Since we don't have the exact values of `a` and `n`, we can't compute a numerical answer. However, we can describe the output in terms of `a[n - 1]` and `n`.

Output: **(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1 (where a[n - 1] is the last element of the list `a` and `n` is the given integer)**
