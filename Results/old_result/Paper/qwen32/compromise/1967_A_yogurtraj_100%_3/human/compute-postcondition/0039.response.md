To determine what will be printed by the given print statement, let's break down the code and the initial state provided:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100 (not directly used in the print statement).
- `n` is an integer provided by the input.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input.
- `r` is calculated as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
- `rem` is 0 (not directly used in the print statement).
- `y` is 0 (not directly used in the print statement).
- `k` is not equal to 0.

### Print Statement:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Calculate `r`**:
   - `r = a[n - 1] + k // n`
   - `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the sorted list `a` (since `a` is 0-indexed, `n - 1` is the index of the last element).
   - `k // n` is the integer division of `k` by `n`.

2. **Calculate `(r - 1) * n`**:
   - First, compute `r - 1`.
   - Then multiply the result by `n`.

3. **Calculate `1 + k % n`**:
   - `k % n` is the remainder when `k` is divided by `n`.
   - Add 1 to this remainder.

4. **Combine the results**:
   - Add the result of `(r - 1) * n` to the result of `1 + k % n`.

### Final Expression:
- The final expression to be printed is `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output the value of the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`, where `r` is calculated as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **(a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1 + k % n (where a[n - 1] is the last element of the sorted list `a`, k is the integer provided by the input, and n is the integer provided by the input)**
