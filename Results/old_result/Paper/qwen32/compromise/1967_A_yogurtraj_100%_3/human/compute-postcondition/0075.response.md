Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer provided by the input and must be at least 1, `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input, `i` is `ii + 2`, `r` is `a[ii + 2] + k // (ii + 3)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - (ii + 2)`, `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables remain unchanged except that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
