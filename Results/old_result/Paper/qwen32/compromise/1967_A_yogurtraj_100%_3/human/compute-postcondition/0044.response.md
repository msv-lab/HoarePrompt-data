The code snippet provided updates the values of `n` and `k` based on the input. The initial state of `n` and `k` are not specified, but they are reassigned here. The values of `t`, `a`, `rem`, `y`, and `ii` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer provided by the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input; `rem` is 0; `y` is 0; `k` is the second integer provided by the input; `ii` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration.**
