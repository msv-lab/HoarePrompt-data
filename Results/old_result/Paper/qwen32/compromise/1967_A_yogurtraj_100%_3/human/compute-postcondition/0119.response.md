Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 2, `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the current input, `ii` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration, `r` is `a[i] + 0 // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `0 % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
