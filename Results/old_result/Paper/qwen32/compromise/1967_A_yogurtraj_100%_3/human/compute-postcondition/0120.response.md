The given code snippet modifies the value of `k` based on the current values of `i`, `a[i]`, and `a[i + 1]`. The other variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `ii` and `i` are incremented from previous iterations but not directly modified in this snippet.

Let's break down the impact:
- `k` is decreased by the product of `(i + 1)` and the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`.

Given that `a` is a sorted list of integers, the difference `a[i + 1] - a[i]` is a non-negative integer. The term `(i + 1)` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 (since `i` is incremented from the previous iteration and starts at least from 1).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 2, `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the current input, `ii` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.**
