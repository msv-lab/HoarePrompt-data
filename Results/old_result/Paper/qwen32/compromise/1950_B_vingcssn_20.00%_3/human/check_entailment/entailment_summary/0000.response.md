Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to handle test cases where the input `n` ranges from 1 to 4. For these values of `n`, the program correctly outputs the corresponding 2n x 2n checkerboard patterns as specified in the problem description. However, the program does not handle cases where `n` is greater than 4. According to the problem statement, `n` can be as large as 20. Since the program outputs 'No esta en el rango' for `n` values greater than 4, it does not fully comply with the requirements of the problem description.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible values of `n` as specified in the problem constraints.

Correctness: **False**
