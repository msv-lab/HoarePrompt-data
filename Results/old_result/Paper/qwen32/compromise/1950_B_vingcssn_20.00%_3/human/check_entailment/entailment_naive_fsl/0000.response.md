Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program only handles specific cases for \( n = 1, 2, 3, \) and \( 4 \). It does not handle any other values of \( n \) within the given range of \( 1 \leq n \leq 20 \). For example, if \( n = 5 \), the program will output "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the correct 10x10 checkerboard pattern. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all possible inputs within the specified range.
