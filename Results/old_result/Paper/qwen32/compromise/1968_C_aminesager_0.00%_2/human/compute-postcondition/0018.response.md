Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500; `T` is a list of integers derived from the string `line` split and converted to integers; `a` is the reversed list of `[1000, 1000 - T[0], 1000 - T[0] - T[1], ..., 1000 - sum(T)]; `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `t` has been decremented by 1. All other variables (`n`, `x`, `T`, `a`, and `result`) remain unchanged.
