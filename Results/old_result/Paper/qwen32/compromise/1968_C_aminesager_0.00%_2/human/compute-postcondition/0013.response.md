To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variable `a`. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, appending to the list `a` the value of the previous element minus the corresponding element in the list `T`.

Here's the breakdown of the loop:
- Initially, `a` is `[1000]`.
- After the first iteration (`i = 1`), `a` becomes `[1000, 1000 - T[0]]`.
- After the second iteration (`i = 2`), `a` becomes `[1000, 1000 - T[0], (1000 - T[0]) - T[1]]`.
- After the third iteration (`i = 3`), `a` becomes `[1000, 1000 - T[0], (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], ((1000 - T[0]) - T[1]) - T[2]]`.

Following this pattern, after the `n-1` iterations, the list `a` will have `n` elements, where each element is calculated as follows:
- `a[0]` is `1000`
- `a[1]` is `1000 - T[0]`
- `a[2]` is `1000 - T[0] - T[1]`
- `a[3]` is `1000 - T[0] - T[1] - T[2]`
- ...
- `a[n-1]` is `1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]`

Therefore, the final state of `a` after all iterations will be a list with `n` elements, where the last element is `1000` minus the sum of all elements in `T`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500; `T` is a list of integers derived from the string `line` split and converted to integers; `a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[0], 1000 - T[0] - T[1], ..., 1000 - sum(T)]`.**

In natural language, after all iterations, the list `a` will contain `n` elements where each element is the result of subtracting the cumulative sum of elements from `T` from 1000, starting with just 1000 for the first element.
