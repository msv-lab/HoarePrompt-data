Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `T` is a list of integers derived from the string `line` split and converted to integers, `a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[0], a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]]`, `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`, `line` is the new input string provided by the user, `i` is `i + 1`**

Explanation: The variable `a` has been updated by appending a new element which is calculated as `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
