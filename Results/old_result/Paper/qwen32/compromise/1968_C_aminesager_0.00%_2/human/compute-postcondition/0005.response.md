The code snippet `T = list(map(int, line.split()))` takes the string `line` input by the user, splits it into a list of substrings, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `T`. This means `T` will now hold a list of integers derived from the string `line`.

The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is the integer input by the user, and `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` is between 1 and 500. The variable `line` is the string input by the user.

After executing the code, the only variable that changes is `T`, which is newly defined. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n` is the integer input by the user; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500; `T` is a list of integers derived from the string `line` split and converted to integers.**
