The code snippet provided is:

```python
n = int(input())
```

This line of code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is already an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1. Since the code reassigns `n` with a new input value, the previous value of `n` is replaced.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the new integer input by the user and must be greater than 1; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500; `T` is a list of integers derived from the string `line` split and converted to integers; `a` is the reversed list of `[1000, 1000 - T[0], 1000 - T[0] - T[1], ..., 1000 - sum(T)]; `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`.**

In natural language, the output state means that `t` remains `t - 1`, `n` is now the new integer input by the user (which must be greater than 1), `x` is still a list of `n-1` integers where each element is between 1 and 500, `T` is still a list of integers derived from a string, `a` is still the reversed list calculated from `T`, and `result` is still the space-separated string of elements from `a`.
