To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the state was:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1
- `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1
- `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500
- `T` is a list of integers derived from the string `line` split and converted to integers
- `a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[0]]`

In the previous iteration, the loop variable `i` would have taken some value from 1 up to `n-1`. For the next iteration to occur, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `n`.

Let's assume that in the previous iteration, `i` had the value `k` (where `1 <= k < n`). After this iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500; `T` is a list of integers derived from the string `line` split and converted to integers; `a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[0]]; `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `k` from the previous iteration, we can generalize it as `i` being incremented by 1 from its previous value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500; `T` is a list of integers derived from the string `line` split and converted to integers; `a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[0]]; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

For clarity, if we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500; `T` is a list of integers derived from the string `line` split and converted to integers; `a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[0]]; `i` is `i_prev + 1` where `i_prev` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since we need a concrete form and `i_prev` was `k` (some value from 1 to `n-2`), the next value of `i` will be `k+1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500; `T` is a list of integers derived from the string `line` split and converted to integers; `a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[0]]; `i` is `i + 1`**

So the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500; `T` is a list of integers derived from the string `line` split and converted to integers; `a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[0]]; `i` is `i + 1`**
