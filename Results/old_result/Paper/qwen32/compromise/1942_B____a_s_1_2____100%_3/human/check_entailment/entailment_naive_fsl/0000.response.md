Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation `p` based on the array `a`. The key issue lies in the calculation and updating of the `mex` value. The current implementation incorrectly assumes that the `mex` value can be determined by taking the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`. This is not correct because the `mex` should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the constructed part of `p` up to that point.

Let's consider an example to illustrate the problem:

**Example Input:**
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- For `i = 0`, `a[0] = 1`, so `p[0] = MEX([]) - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1` (incorrect, `p[0]` should be `0`).
- For `i = 1`, `a[1] = 1`, so `p[1] = MEX([0]) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0` (incorrect, `p[1]` should be `1`).
- For `i = 2`, `a[2] = -2`, so `p[2] = MEX([0, 1]) - (-2) = 2 + 2 = 4` (correct).
- For `i = 3`, `a[3] = 1`, so `p[3] = MEX([0, 1, 4]) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1` (incorrect, `p[3]` should be `2`).
- For `i = 4`, `a[4] = 2`, so `p[4] = MEX([0, 1, 4, 2]) - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1` (incorrect, `p[4]` should be `3`).

The correct approach would involve maintaining a set of used numbers to determine the correct `mex` at each step. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        used = set()
        mex = 0
        for i in range(n):
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            used.add(p[i])
            mex = 0  # Reset mex to find the next smallest unused number
        print(*p)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the `mex` is calculated correctly by maintaining a set of used numbers and resetting the `mex` to find the smallest unused number at each step.
