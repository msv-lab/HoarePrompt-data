The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, so `i` should be `0`.

The value of `n` does not need to be adjusted because the loop condition depends on `i` and the range specified by `n` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list where `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]`, `mex` is the minimum of the previous `mex` and `p[i]`, `i` is 0**
