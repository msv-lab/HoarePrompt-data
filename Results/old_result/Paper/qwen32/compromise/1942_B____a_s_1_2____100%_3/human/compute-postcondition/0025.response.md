The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Since the loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was used in the loop condition and was decremented by 1.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop starts with `i` initialized to `n - 1` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` is less than `0`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k` such that `0 <= k <= n - 1`. For the next iteration, `i` should be `k - 1`.

Since the problem statement does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we assume `i` was `k` and for the next iteration, `i` should be `k - 1`. If `k` was `0` (the last iteration), then the loop would terminate, and there would be no next iteration. However, if `k` was greater than `0`, then the next value of `i` should be `k - 1`.

Since we do not have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can generalize that at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list where the `i`-th element is `mex - a[i]` and all other elements are -1; `mex` is `min(n, n - a[i])`; `i` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

However, to be more specific and assuming `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, the state would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list where the `i`-th element is `mex - a[i]` and all other elements are -1; `mex` is `min(n, n - a[i])`; `i` is `k - 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

If we assume the loop just finished an iteration where `i` was `1`, then the next iteration would start with `i` being `0`. If `i` was `0` in the previous iteration, then the loop would terminate, and there would be no next iteration.

For the sake of providing a concrete state, let's assume the loop just finished with `i` being `1`. Therefore, the next iteration would start with `i` being `0`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list where the `i`-th element is `mex - a[i]` and all other elements are -1; `mex` is `min(n, n - a[i])`; `i` is 0**.
