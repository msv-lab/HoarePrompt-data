The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates from `n - 1` to `0` with a step of `-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, so it should be `n - 3`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `p`, `mex`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`, `mex` is the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`, `i` is `n - 3`**
