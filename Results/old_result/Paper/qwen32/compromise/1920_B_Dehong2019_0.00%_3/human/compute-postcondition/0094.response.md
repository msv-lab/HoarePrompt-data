Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, `x`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it computes and prints a value that represents the maximum possible sum of the list `a` after performing specific operations based on the values of `k` and `x`.**
