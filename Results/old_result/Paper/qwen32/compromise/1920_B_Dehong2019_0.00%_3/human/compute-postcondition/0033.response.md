The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. The initial state of `ans1`, `ans2`, and `ans` is not affected by this input operation. Therefore, the only change is that `n`, `k`, and `x` are now assigned the values from the input.

Output State: **`ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` minus twice the sum of the elements from index `x` to `x + k - 1` of `a` (if those indices are within bounds); `ans2` remains unchanged; `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`; `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values from the input.**
