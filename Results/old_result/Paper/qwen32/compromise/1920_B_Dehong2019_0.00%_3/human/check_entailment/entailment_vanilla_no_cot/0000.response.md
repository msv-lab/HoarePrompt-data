Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob. Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Alice's Removal:**
   - The program assumes that Alice will always remove the largest `k` elements. However, this is not always optimal. Alice should remove the smallest `k` elements to maximize the sum after Bob's turn.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Bob's Multiplication:**
   - The program assumes that Bob will always flip the largest `x` elements to negative. This is not always optimal either. Bob should flip the smallest `x` elements to negative after Alice's removal to minimize the sum.

3. **Logic Errors in the Loop:**
   - The logic for updating the sum `ans1` and `ans2` is flawed. The program does not correctly simulate the optimal moves of both players.

4. **Final Answer Selection:**
   - The final answer is selected incorrectly. The program does not properly account for all possible optimal moves by both players.

To fix the program, we need to:
- Sort the array and handle Alice's removal by removing the smallest `k` elements.
- After Alice's removal, handle Bob's flips by flipping the smallest `x` elements.
- Calculate the sum after both players have made their optimal moves.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Remove the smallest k elements
        a.sort()
        if k > 0:
            a = a[k:]
        
        # Flip the smallest x elements
        a.sort()
        if x > 0:
            for i in range(min(x, len(a))):
                a[i] = -a[i]
        
        # Calculate the final sum
        print(sum(a))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that both players make their optimal moves, leading to the correct final sum.
