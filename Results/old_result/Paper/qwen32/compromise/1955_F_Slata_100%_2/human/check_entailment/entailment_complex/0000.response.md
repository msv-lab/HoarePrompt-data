### Reasoning:

The task is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally. Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the numbers in the sequence is zero. Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly computes this.

1. **Understanding XOR**:
   - XOR of a number with itself is 0.
   - XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.
   - XOR of an even number of ones is 0.
   - XOR of an odd number of ones is 1.
   - XOR of twos and fours will always be 0 because 2 in binary is 10, and 4 in binary is 100. XORing any even number of these will result in 0.
   - XOR of threes is more complex, but we can use the fact that 3 in binary is 11. XORing an even number of threes results in 0, and XORing an odd number of threes results in 11 (which is 3 in decimal).

2. **Eve's Strategy**:
   - Eve wants Bob to win as many times as possible, which means she wants the XOR of the remaining numbers to be zero as many times as possible.
   - To achieve this, Eve should aim to remove numbers in such a way that the remaining numbers have an even number of ones and threes, and any number of twos and fours.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program calculates `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`, which counts the maximum number of times Eve can remove pairs of each number type.
   - It also adds `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`, which checks if there is exactly one leftover of each type (ones, threes), which would make the XOR of the remaining numbers zero.

4. **Verification with Examples**:
   - For the input `1 1 1 0`:
     - `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` is `0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0`.
     - `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3` is `1 + 1 + 1 == 3`, which is True, so it adds 1.
     - Total: `0 + 1 = 1`. This matches the expected output.
   - For the input `1 0 1 2`:
     - `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` is `0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`.
     - `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3` is `1 + 0 + 1 == 2`, which is False, so it adds 0.
     - Total: `1 + 0 = 1`. This matches the expected output.
   - For the input `2 2 2 0`:
     - `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` is `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`.
     - `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3` is `0 + 0 + 0 == 0`, which is False, so it adds 0.
     - Total: `3 + 0 = 3`. This matches the expected output.
   - For the input `3 3 2 0`:
     - `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` is `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`.
     - `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3` is `1 + 1 + 0 == 2`, which is False, so it adds 0.
     - Total: `3 + 0 = 3`. This matches the expected output.
   - For the input `0 9 9 9`:
     - `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` is `0 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 12`.
     - `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3` is `0 + 1 + 1 == 2`, which is False, so it adds 0.
     - Total: `12 + 0 = 12`. This matches the expected output.
