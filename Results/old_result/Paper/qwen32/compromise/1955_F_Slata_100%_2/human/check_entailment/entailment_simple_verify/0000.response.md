Let's carefully analyze the problem and the program to ensure its correctness. The goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally. Bob wins when the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

### Problem Recap:
- Alice wins if the XOR of the numbers is non-zero.
- Bob wins if the XOR is zero.
- Eve removes one number after each game until the sequence is empty.
- Eve wants Bob to win as many times as possible.

### Key Observations:
1. **XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of two identical numbers is zero.
   - XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if the count of each number that contributes a non-zero bit in the XOR result is even.
   - Specifically, for the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4:
     - 1 in binary is `01`
     - 2 in binary is `10`
     - 3 in binary is `11`
     - 4 in binary is `100`
   - Therefore, for the XOR to be zero:
     - The count of 1s and 3s should be even (since both contribute to the least significant bit).
     - The count of 2s and 4s should be even (since both contribute to the second least significant bit).

2. **Optimal Strategy for Eve**:
   - Eve should aim to leave an even count of 1s and 3s, and an even count of 2s and 4s after each removal to maximize Bob's wins.
   - If the counts are already even, Bob wins immediately.
   - If not, Eve should remove numbers to make the counts even.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by:
- Pairing each number (`a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`).
- Checking if there is exactly one leftover of each 1, 2, and 3 (`int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`).

### Detailed Breakdown:
- **Pairing**: Each pair of identical numbers does not contribute to a non-zero XOR, so Bob wins each time a pair is removed.
- **Leftovers**: If there is exactly one leftover of each 1, 2, and 3, the XOR of these leftovers is zero, allowing Bob to win once more.

### Testing with Example Cases:
1. **Input**: `1 1 1 0`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: One leftover of each 1, 2, and 3 is not possible, so Bob wins once when all numbers are paired.
2. **Input**: `1 0 1 2`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Bob wins once when one 1 and one 3 are removed, leaving 2 and 4, which XOR to 0.
3. **Input**: `2 2 2 0`
   - Output: `3`
   - Explanation: Bob wins three times by removing pairs optimally.
4. **Input**: `3 3 2 0`
   - Output: `3`
   - Explanation: Bob wins three times by removing pairs optimally.
5. **Input**: `0 9 9 9`
   - Output: `12`
   - Explanation: Bob wins twelve times by removing pairs optimally.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by pairing numbers and considering the optimal removal strategy. The annotations and reasoning provided in the original assessment are accurate.

Final: **True**.
