Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an input integer; `c` is an input integer; `d` is an input string; `e` is an input string; `k` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(b):
    if d[j] in e[k:]:
        k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k
        if k == c or j == b - 1:
            k = j + 1
            break
    else:
        k = j
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `c` is an input integer; `d` is an input string; `e` is an input string; if `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then `k` is updated to `j + 1` if `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, otherwise no changes are made to `k`. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to `j`. In both cases, the loop or if statement is terminated.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `c` is an input integer; `d` is an input string; `e` is an input string; `j` is 4. If `d[4]` is in `e[k:]`, then `k` is updated to `e[k:].index(d[4]) + 1 + k`. If after this update `k` equals `c` or `k` equals `b - 1`, then `k` is set to 5. If `d[4]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to 4. In both cases, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `c` is an input integer; `d` is an input string; `e` is an input string; `j` is 5. If `d[5]` is in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to the position of `d[5]` in the substring `e[5:]` plus 5. If `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of and `k` is set to 6. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. If `d[5]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is 5 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
