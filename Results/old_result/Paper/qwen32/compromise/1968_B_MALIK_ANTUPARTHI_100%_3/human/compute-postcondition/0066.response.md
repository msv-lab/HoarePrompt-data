Postcondition: **`k` is `j + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` and `e` are values, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, `k` remains `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`. If `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
