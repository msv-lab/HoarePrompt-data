The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3 and `b` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`k` is 0, `i` is 3, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is the second integer from the input, `d` is the input string, `e` is the next input from the user, `j` is 4**
