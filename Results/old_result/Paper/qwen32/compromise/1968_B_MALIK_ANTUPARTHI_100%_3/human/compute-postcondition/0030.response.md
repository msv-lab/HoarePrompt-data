The code snippet `k = j` assigns the value of `j` to `k`. Given that `j` is 5, `k` will also be 5. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `c` is an input integer; `d` is an input string; `e` is an input string; `j` is 5; `k` is 5**.
