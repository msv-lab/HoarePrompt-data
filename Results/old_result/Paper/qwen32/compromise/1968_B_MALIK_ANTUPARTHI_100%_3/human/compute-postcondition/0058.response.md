Postcondition: **`k` is either `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k` or `j + 1`, depending on whether `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. `b` is greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` and `e` are values. `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.**
