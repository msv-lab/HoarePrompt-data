To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and how it affects the variables. The given code is:

```python
k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k
```

Here's the breakdown:

- `k` is initially 5.
- `d` is a string, and `j` is 5, so `d[j]` refers to the 6th character of `d` (since indexing starts at 0).
- `e` is a string, and `e[k:]` means a substring of `e` starting from index 5 to the end of the string.
- `e[k:].index(d[j])` finds the index of the character `d[j]` within the substring `e[k:]`. This index is then incremented by 1 and added to `k`.

Let's denote:
- `d[j]` as the character at the 6th position of string `d`.
- `e[k:]` as the substring of `e` starting from the 6th position.
- `e[k:].index(d[j])` as the index of `d[j]` within `e[k:]`.

Thus, `k` is updated to be the position of `d[j]` in `e` plus 6 (since we start searching from index 5 in `e`).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `c` is an input integer; `d` is an input string; `e` is an input string; `j` is 5; `k` is the position of `d[5]` in the substring `e[5:]` plus 5.**

In simpler terms:
- `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `j` retain their initial values.
- `k` is recalculated to be the position of the 6th character of `d` in the substring of `e` starting from the 6th character, plus 5.
