The value of `k` is updated to `j`. The other variables (`i`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` is a value, `e` is a value, and `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]` still holds, with the updated `k` value.

Output State: **`k` is `j`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` is a value, `e` is a value, and `d[j]` is not in `e[j:]`**.
