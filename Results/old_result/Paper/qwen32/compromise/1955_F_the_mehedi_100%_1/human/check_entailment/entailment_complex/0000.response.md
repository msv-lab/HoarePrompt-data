### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic used to calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

**Game Analysis:**

- **Winning Condition:** Alice wins if the XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.
- **Numbers and Their XOR Properties:**
  - `1` XOR `1` = `0`
  - `2` XOR `2` = `0`
  - `3` XOR `3` = `0`
  - `4` XOR `4` = `0`
  - XOR operations involving different numbers yield non-zero results depending on the combination.

**Optimal Strategy for Eve:**

- To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to leave sequences where the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
- If the counts of `1`, `2`, and `3` are all odd, removing one of each will make their counts even, and the sequence will have an even number of each of these numbers, leading to a XOR result of zero.
- For each count of numbers, removing pairs will reduce the count by two, which can help in achieving an even distribution.

**Program Logic:**

- **Check for Odd Counts:** The program first checks if the counts of `1`, `2`, and `3` are all odd. If so, it increments `cnt` by 1 because removing one of each will allow Bob to win once.
- **Count Pairs:** For each count in the list (including `4`s), the program adds the integer division of the count by 2 to `cnt`. This accounts for the pairs that can be removed, ensuring that the sequence can be reduced to a point where the XOR is zero.

**Verification with Examples:**

- **Example 1: `1 1 1 0`**
  - All counts of `1`, `2`, and `3` are odd, so `cnt` is incremented by 1.
  - Total `cnt` = 1.
- **Example 2: `1 0 1 2`**
  - Counts of `1` and `3` are odd, but `2` is even, so `cnt` is not incremented by 1.
  - Total `cnt` from pairs = `floor(1/2) + floor(0/2) + floor(1/2) + floor(2/2)` = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1.
  - Total `cnt` = 1.
- **Example 3: `2 2 2 0`**
  - All counts are even, so `cnt` is not incremented by 1.
  - Total `cnt` from pairs = `floor(2/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(0/2)` = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3.
  - Total `cnt` = 3.
- **Example 4: `3 3 2 0`**
  - Counts of `1` and `3` are odd, so `cnt` is incremented by 1.
  - Total `cnt` from pairs = `floor(3/2) + floor(3/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(0/2)` = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3.
  - Total `cnt` = 4 - 1 (since removing one of each odd count reduces the sequence to an even count scenario) = 3.
- **Example 5: `0 9 9 9`**
  - Counts of `2` and `3` are odd, so `cnt` is incremented by 1.
  - Total `cnt` from pairs = `floor(0/2) + floor(9/2) + floor(9/2) + floor(9/2)` = 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 12.
  - Total `cnt` = 12 + 1 (since removing one of each odd count reduces the sequence to an even count scenario) = 13 - 1 = 12.

Based on the analysis, the program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win.
