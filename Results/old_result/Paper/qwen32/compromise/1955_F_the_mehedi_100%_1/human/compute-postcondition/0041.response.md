To determine the output of the `print(cnt)` statement, we need to understand the value of `cnt` based on the provided initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `t` is greater than 0, but `t` is not used in the calculation of `cnt`.
2. `a` is a list of integers provided by user input.
3. `cnt` is calculated differently based on whether the first three elements of `a` are all odd:
   - If the first three elements of `a` are all odd, `cnt` is `1 + sum(math.floor(x / 2) for x in a)`.
   - Otherwise, `cnt` is `sum(math.floor(x / 2) for x in a)`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation of `cnt`:

1. **Check the first three elements of `a`**:
   - If they are all odd, add 1 to the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all `x` in `a`.
   - Otherwise, just compute the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all `x` in `a`.

2. **Calculate `math.floor(x / 2)` for each `x` in `a`**:
   - This operation divides each integer `x` by 2 and takes the floor of the result, effectively halving the integer and rounding down to the nearest whole number.

### Final Output Description:
- If the first three elements of `a` are all odd, `cnt` will be `1 + sum(math.floor(x / 2) for x in a)`.
- If at least one of the first three elements of `a` is not odd, `cnt` will be `sum(math.floor(x / 2) for x in a)`.

Since the exact values of the list `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `cnt`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output `cnt` calculated as described above.

### Final Output:
Output: **cnt (where cnt is 1 + sum(math.floor(x / 2) for x in a) if the first three elements of a are all odd, otherwise cnt is sum(math.floor(x / 2) for x in a))**
