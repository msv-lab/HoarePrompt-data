The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user input, `cnt` is 1.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user input, `cnt` is 1.**
