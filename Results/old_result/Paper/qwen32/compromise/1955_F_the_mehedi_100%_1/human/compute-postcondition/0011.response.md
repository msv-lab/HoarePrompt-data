Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element remaining to be processed, `x` is the next element in `a`, `cnt` is increased by `math.floor(x / 2)`**

In natural language: The variable `cnt` is updated by adding the integer division result of `x` by 2 to it. The values of `t`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.
