Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is the second integer provided by the input; `n` is the first integer provided by the input and is greater than `m`; `k` is the third integer provided by the input; `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the latest input; `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input; `done` is an empty set; `extra` is an empty set; `j` is `m-1`; `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    if a[j] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[j])
        done.add(a[j])
    else:
        extra.add(a[j])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is the second integer provided by the input and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the first integer provided by the input and is greater than `m`; `k` is the third integer provided by the input; `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the latest input; `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input with `a[j]` removed if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `todo` remains unchanged; `done` is a set containing `a[m-1]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is an empty set; `extra` is an empty set if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `extra` contains `a[j]`; `j` is `m-1`; `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `m` is the second integer provided by the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the first integer provided by the input and is greater than `m`, `k` is the third integer provided by the input, `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the latest input, `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input with `a[m-1]` removed if it was in `todo`, `done` is a set containing `a[m-1]` and `a[m]` if `a[m-1]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is a set containing `a[m]` if `a[m]` was in `todo`, `extra` is an empty set if `a[m-1]` was in `todo`, otherwise `extra` contains `a[m-1]` and `a[m]` if `a[m]` was not in `todo`, `j` is `m`, `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `m` is the second integer provided by the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the first integer provided by the input and is greater than `m`, `k` is the third integer provided by the input, `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the latest input, `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input with `a[m-1]` removed if it was in `todo` and `a[0]` removed if `a[j]` was in `todo`. `done` is a set containing `a[m-1]`, `a[m]`, and `a[0]` if `a[m-1]` was in `todo` and `a[j]` was in `todo`; otherwise, `done` is a set containing `a[m]` and `a[0]` if `a[m]` was in `todo` and `a[j]` was in `todo`. `extra` is an empty set if `a[m-1]` was in `todo` and `a[j]` was in `todo`; otherwise, `extra` contains `a[m-1]` and `a[m]` if `a[m]` was not in `todo` and `a[j]` was not in `todo`, or contains `a[0]` if `a[m-1]` was in `todo` and `a[j]` was not in `todo`. `j` is 0, `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
