Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers; `todo` is a set of unique integers; `done` is a set containing elements from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` except `old`; `extra` is a set containing elements from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]`; `j` is `m-1`; `old` is `a[r - m]`; `a[r]` is not in `todo`; `r` is `r + 1`**

In natural language: The element `old` has been removed from the set `done`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
