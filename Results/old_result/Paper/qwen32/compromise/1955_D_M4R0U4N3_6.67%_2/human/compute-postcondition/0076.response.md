Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is any integer; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input; `done` is a set (now empty); `extra` is a set containing all elements from the last `n - m` elements of the new `a` that were not in `todo`; `j` is `m`; `ans` is the number of times during the loop that the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k`. `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input.**

In this output state, the variable `done` has been reset to an empty set, while all other variables retain their previously assigned values.
