Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` where `1 <= k <= m <= n`. It also accepts a list `a` of `n` integers and a list `b` of `m` integers. The function returns a value for each test case based on the given constraints and relationships.**
