Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is the integer provided by the input; `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input; `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input, excluding any elements that were in the first `m` elements of `a` and were in `todo`. If `a[r]` was in `todo`, it has been removed from `todo` and `a[m]` is added to `done`. If `a[r]` was not in `todo`, `a[m]` is added to `extra`. `extra` is a set containing all elements from the first `m` elements of `a` that were not in `todo`, excluding `old` if `old` was in `extra`. `done` is a set of integers, and if `old` was in `done`, `old` is now in `todo` and removed from `done`. `j` is `m-1`; `ans` is 1 if len(done) >= k else 0; `r` is `m`; `old` is `a[0]` and is not in `extra`.**
