The code `extra.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[4]` to the set `extra`. Since `j` is 4, `a[4]` is the fifth element in the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input with `m` greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `todo` is a set of unique integers obtained from the input, except it no longer contains `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`; `done` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is an empty set; `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` is an empty set, and now `extra` also contains `a[4]`; `j` is 4.**

In simpler terms, the element `a[4]` has been added to the set `extra`. All other variables remain unchanged.
