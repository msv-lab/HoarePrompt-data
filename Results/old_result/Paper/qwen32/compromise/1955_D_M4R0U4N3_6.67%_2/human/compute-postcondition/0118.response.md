The code snippet `extra.remove(old)` removes the element `old` from the set `extra`. Given that `old` is `a[1]` and is not in `extra` initially, this operation does not change the set `extra` because `old` is not a member of it. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged except for the fact that the operation was attempted on `extra`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is the integer provided by the input; `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input; `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input, excluding any elements that were in the first `m` elements of `a` and were in `todo`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from the first `m` elements of `a` that were not in `todo`, excluding `old` if `old` was in `extra`; `done` is a set of integers; `j` is `m-1`; `r` is `m + 1`; `old` is `a[1]` and is not in `extra`; `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is less than `k`, otherwise `ans` is 2.**
