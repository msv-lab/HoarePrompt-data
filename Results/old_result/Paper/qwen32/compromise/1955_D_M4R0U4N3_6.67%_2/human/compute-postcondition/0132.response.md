The code snippet provided is `done.remove(old)`, which means the element `old` will be removed from the list `done`. Since `old` is `a[2]` and it is not in `extra`, the removal operation will modify the list `done` by removing the element `a[2]`.

Given the initial state, the only change will be in the list `done` after the removal of `old`. The other variables will remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer greater than `m`, `k` is the integer provided by the input, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `j` is `m-1`, `r` is `m + 2`, `old` is `a[2]` and is not in `extra`, `done` has `old` removed from it, if the length of `done` is less than `k`, `ans` is 1; otherwise, `ans` is 3**.
