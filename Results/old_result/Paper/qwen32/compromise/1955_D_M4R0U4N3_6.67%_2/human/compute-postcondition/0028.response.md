The code snippet `extra.remove(old)` removes the element `old` from the set `extra`. Given that `old` is defined as `a[r - m]` and it is in `extra`, after this operation, `extra` will no longer contain `old`.

Here is the updated state of the variables:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `m` remains any integer.
- `n` remains an integer greater than `m`.
- `k` remains the integer provided by the input.
- `a` remains the list of integers obtained from the input.
- `todo` remains a set of unique integers obtained from the input, except it no longer contains any elements that were in `a` and also in `todo`.
- `done` remains a set containing all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`.
- `extra` is now a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, excluding `old`.
- `j` remains `m`.
- `ans` remains 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains 0.
- `old` remains `a[r - m]` and it is no longer in `extra`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is any integer; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `todo` is a set of unique integers obtained from the input, except it no longer contains any elements that were in `a` and also in `todo`; `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, excluding `old`; `j` is `m`; `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0; `old` is `a[r - m]` and it is no longer in `extra`.**
