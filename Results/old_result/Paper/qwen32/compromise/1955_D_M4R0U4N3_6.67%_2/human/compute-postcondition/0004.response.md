The provided code snippet initializes a new set named `done` without modifying the existing variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, or `todo`. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `todo` is a set of unique integers obtained from the input; `done` is an empty set.**
