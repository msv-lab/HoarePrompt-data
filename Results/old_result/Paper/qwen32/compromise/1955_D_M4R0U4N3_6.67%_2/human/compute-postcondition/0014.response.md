Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input with `m` greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `todo` is a set of unique integers obtained from the input, except it no longer contains `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`; `done` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is an empty set; `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` is an empty set; `j` is incremented by 1; `a[j]` has been removed from `todo` and added to `done`.**

Natural Language: The element `a[j]` has been removed from the set `todo` and added to the set `done`. All other variables retain their previous values and states, except `j` has been incremented by 1.
