Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is any integer; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `todo` is a set of unique integers obtained from the input with `a[r]` removed; `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo` with adjustments based on the presence of `old`, and now includes `a[r]`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, with `old` removed if it was present; `j` is `m`; `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` (after any removal) is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0; `old` is `a[r - m]`.**

In natural language: The variable `done` now includes the element `a[r]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, except `ans`, which may have been updated to 1 if the length of `done` is now greater than or equal to `k`.
