The code snippet provided initializes a new set named `extra`. No other variables are modified by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `todo`, and `done` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `todo` is a set of unique integers obtained from the input; `done` is an empty set; `extra` is an empty set.**
