The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers; `todo` is a set of unique integers; `done` is a set containing elements from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` except `old` if `old` was in `done`; `extra` is a set containing elements from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` except `a[r - m]` if `old` was in `extra`; `j` is `m-1`; `old` is `a[r - m]`; `a[r]` is not in `todo`; `r` is `r + 1`. If `old` was in `done`, `old` is added to `todo` and removed from `done`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `a[r]` is added to `done`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `a[r]` is added to `extra`; `ans` is incremented by 1.**
