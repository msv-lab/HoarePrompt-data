Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input, excluding `a[1]` if `a[1]` was in `todo`, and also excluding `a[2]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`; `done` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[0]` was in `todo`, `a[1]` if `a[1]` was in `todo`, and `a[2]` if `a[2]` was in `todo`; `extra` is an empty set if `a[0]` was in `todo`, otherwise `extra` contains `a[0]` and `a[1]` if `a[1]` was not in `todo`, and also contains `a[2]` if `a[2]` was not in `todo`; `j` is 2; `ans` is the number of times during the loop that the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k`.**
