You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial integer input. For each test case, the final `ans` value represents the number of times during the sliding window process that the number of elements in the `done` set was greater than or equal to `k`. The sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` are reset at the start of each test case and are only relevant within the context of that specific test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python code to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- Maxim has an array `a` of length `n` and an array `b` of length `m`.
- We need to find how many subarrays of `a` of length `m` can be rearranged to match at least `k` elements of `b`.
- The solution must handle up to 10,000 test cases with `n` and `m` up to 200,000 in total.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - `todo` is a set of elements from `b` that need to be matched.
   - `done` is a set of elements from `b` that have been matched in the current window.
   - `extra` is a set of elements in the current window that are not in `b`.

3. **Sliding Window Technique:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check each subarray of `a` of length `m`.
   - It initializes the window with the first `m` elements of `a`.
   - For each element in the initial window, it checks if it is in `todo` and updates `done` and `extra` accordingly.
   - If the number of matched elements (`len(done)`) is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer.

4. **Sliding the Window:**
   - For each new element added to the window (from `a[m]` to `a[n-1]`), it:
     - Removes the element that is sliding out of the window (`old`).
     - Adds the new element (`a[r]`).
     - Updates `done`, `todo`, and `extra` based on whether `old` and `a[r]` are in `b`.
     - Checks if the current window has at least `k` matched elements and updates the answer if so.

### Correctness Check:
- The code uses a sliding window to efficiently count the number of good subarrays.
- It correctly handles the updates to `done`, `todo`, and `extra` as the window slides.
- The use of sets ensures that the operations are efficient, which is crucial given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the sliding window technique to solve the problem as described. It efficiently handles the updates and checks required to determine the number of good subarrays.

Correctness: **True**
