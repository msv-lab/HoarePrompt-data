Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of tuples `cases`, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `k`. The function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the integer 25 and a predefined list of powers of 2 up to 2^27, regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.**
