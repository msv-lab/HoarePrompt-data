The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. This action does not affect the variables `t` or `cases`. Therefore, the initial state of `t` and `cases` remains unchanged. The only change is the creation of the `results` list which is initially empty.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and k such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n; `results` is an empty list.**
