Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Base Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the case where `n == k` by setting up one stall with a price of 1, so Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

2. **Incorrect Condition**: The condition `elif n + 2 > k * 2` is not sufficient to determine if Bob can set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. This condition does not consider the possibility of using more than two stalls and does not ensure that the total number of jewels bought is exactly `k`.

3. **Limited Stall Usage**: The program only considers setting up 1 or 2 stalls, whereas the problem allows for up to 60 stalls. This means the program misses many possible solutions, especially for larger values of `k`.

4. **General Solution**: To solve the problem correctly, Bob needs to be able to set up stalls such that the sum of the maximum number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall equals `k`. One way to achieve this is to use the binary representation of `k` to determine the prices of the stalls. For example, if `k = 13`, the binary representation is `1101`, which means Alice can buy 1 jewel from a stall priced at 1, 0 jewels from a stall priced at 2, 1 jewel from a stall priced at 4, and 1 jewel from a stall priced at 8, totaling 13 jewels.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        if n < k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            prices = []
            remaining_k = k
            power_of_two = 1
            while remaining_k > 0:
                if remaining_k & 1:
                    prices.append(power_of_two)
                power_of_two *= 2
                remaining_k >>= 1
            if len(prices) > 60:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')
                print(len(prices))
                print(' '.join(map(str, prices)))

func()
```

This corrected program uses the binary representation of `k` to determine the prices of the stalls, ensuring that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. It also checks that the number of stalls does not exceed 60.
