Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap
The task is to determine if it's possible to make an array sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements that are greater than or equal to 10 into their constituent digits.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` to process the input and determine if the array can be sorted as required.
   - The result of each test case (1 for YES, 0 for NO) is stored in the list `b`.
   - Finally, it prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the values in `b`.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - Reads the length `k` of the array and the array `a` itself.
   - Converts the input string of array elements into a list of integers.
   - Initializes an empty list `c` to store the transformed array.
   - Iterates over each element in the array `a`:
     - If the element is greater than 10, it splits the element into its digits.
     - It checks if the digits can be inserted in a way that maintains the non-decreasing order:
       - If the tens digit is less than or equal to the units digit, it appends both digits to `c`.
       - Otherwise, it appends the original number.
     - If the element is not greater than 10, it simply appends it to `c`.
   - After processing all elements, it checks if the list `c` is sorted.
   - It appends 1 to `b` if `c` is sorted, otherwise it appends 0.

### Issues in the Program
- **Splitting Logic:** The logic for splitting and inserting digits is flawed. The program does not correctly handle the insertion of digits in a way that would maintain the non-decreasing order. For example, it does not consider the correct placement of digits relative to the previous elements in the array.
- **Edge Cases:** The program does not handle cases where the array is already sorted or where the digits of a number need to be inserted in a specific order relative to surrounding elements.

### Example Analysis
- For the input `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program might split `12` into `[1, 2]`, but it does not guarantee that the entire array remains sorted after such operations.
- For the input `[12, 28, 5]`, the program might incorrectly determine that it's possible to sort the array, which is not the case.

### Conclusion
Given the flawed logic in the program, particularly in how it handles the insertion of digits, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

**Correctness: False**
