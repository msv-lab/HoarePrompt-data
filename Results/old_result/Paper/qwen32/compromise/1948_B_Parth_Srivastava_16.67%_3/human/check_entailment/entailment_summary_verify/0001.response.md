### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the given program and the function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We are given an integer array `a` of length `n`.
- We can split any element `a[i]` (if `a[i] >= 10`) into its digits and insert them in the same position.
- The goal is to determine if it's possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order using the operation any number of times.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` and stores the result in list `b`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a`.
   - Initializes an empty list `c` to store the transformed array.
   - Iterates over each element in `a`:
     - If the element is greater than 10, it splits the element into its digits.
     - It checks if the tens digit is less than or equal to the units digit. If true, it appends the digits in order; otherwise, it appends the original number.
     - If the element is not greater than 10, it appends the element as is.
   - After processing all elements, it checks if the list `c` is sorted and appends `1` to `b` if it is, otherwise `0`.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic:**
   - The function summary states that the function splits numbers greater than 10 into their digits and rearranges them if necessary to ensure the tens digit is less than or equal to the units digit.
   - This logic is flawed because it does not consider the overall sorted order of the array. The problem requires the entire array to be sorted after the operation, not just the individual digits of each number.

2. **Sorting Logic:**
   - The function checks if the list `c` is sorted after processing, but it does not correctly simulate the process of splitting numbers and checking if it's possible to achieve a sorted array at any point.
   - It should simulate the operation of splitting numbers and verify if the array can be sorted after any sequence of splits.

#### Correctness:
Given the issues in the logic for splitting numbers and checking the sorted order, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function summary does not fully capture the requirement to ensure the entire array can be sorted after any sequence of splits.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
