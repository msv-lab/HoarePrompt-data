You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each involving two lists of integers `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the differences between elements of the two lists after sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order. The result is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of the sorted lists, considering specific conditions for uniform lists.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to maximize the total difference `D = Σ |a_i - c_i|` where `c_i` is an array of `n` integers chosen from `m` integers `b_i` and arranged in any order. The goal is to make `c_i` as different from `a_i` as possible.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, the array `a`, and the array `c` (which is actually supposed to be `b` based on the problem statement).

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The program checks if all elements in `a` and `c` are the same. If so, it outputs `0` because no difference can be achieved.
   - However, there is a logical inconsistency here. The condition `len(set(a)) == 1 and len(set(c)) == 1 and (a[0] == c[0])` should be checking `b` instead of `c`. This is a critical issue.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The program sorts `a` in ascending order and `c` (which should be `b`) in descending order. This is a correct strategy to maximize the differences.

4. **Difference Calculation:**
   - The program iterates over the elements of `a` and calculates the absolute differences between the smallest and largest available elements in `c` (which should be `b`).
   - It sums up the maximum possible differences, which is a correct approach.

### Issues Identified
- The variable `c` is used instead of `b` in the comparison and sorting steps. This is a significant error.
- The logic for handling the special case where all elements in `a` and `b` are the same is correct but is incorrectly implemented due to the use of `c`.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Corrected variable name
        if len(set(a)) == 1 and len(set(b)) == 1 and (a[0] == b[0]):  # Corrected variable name
            print(0)
            continue
        a.sort()
        b.sort(reverse=True)  # Corrected variable name
        if len(a) == 1:
            print(max(abs(a[0] - max(b)), abs(a[0] - min(b))))  # Corrected variable name
            continue
        (i, j, ans) = (0, 0, 0)  # Corrected index handling
        for k in range(len(a)):
            t1 = abs(a[i] - b[i])
            t2 = abs(a[len(a) - 1 - k] - b[k])  # Corrected index handling
            ans += max(t1, t2)
        print(ans)

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Conclusion
The original program is incorrect due to the misuse of the variable `c` instead of `b` and incorrect index handling in the last loop.

Correctness: **False**
