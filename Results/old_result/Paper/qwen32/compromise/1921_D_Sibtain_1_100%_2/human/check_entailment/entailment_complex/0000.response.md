### Reasoning:
The program is designed to solve the problem by following these steps:
1. **Input Parsing:** For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the lists `a` and `b`.
2. **Edge Case Handling:** If both `a` and `b` contain the same single unique element, the result is `0` because the arrays are identical.
3. **Sorting:** The list `a` is sorted in ascending order, and the list `b` is sorted in descending order.
4. **Difference Calculation:** The program calculates the maximum possible total difference `D` by considering the absolute differences between elements of the sorted lists. It iterates through the elements of `a` and `b`, choosing the maximum possible difference at each step.
5. **Output:** The result for each test case is printed.

The logic of the program is sound:
- Sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order ensures that the largest possible differences are considered first.
- The loop iterates through each element of `a` and `b`, comparing the differences between corresponding elements and adding the maximum difference to the total `D`.
- The edge case for uniform lists is correctly handled by checking if both `a` and `b` contain the same single unique element.

### Correctness:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference `D` for each test case as per the problem description. The program handles edge cases appropriately and uses efficient sorting and comparison operations.

**Correctness: True**
