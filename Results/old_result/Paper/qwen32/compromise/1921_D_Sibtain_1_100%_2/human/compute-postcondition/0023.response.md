Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, sorted in descending order; `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2`; `i` is 0 if `t2` > `t1` else 1; `j` is 2 if `t2` > `t1` else 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` has been updated to include the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. The values of `i` and `j` have been set based on the comparison between `t1` and `t2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
