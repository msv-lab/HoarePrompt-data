Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input with a length of 1; `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, sorted in descending order. If all elements in `a` are the same and all elements in `c` are the same, and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, then the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition is not satisfied. The current length of `a` is 1.**
