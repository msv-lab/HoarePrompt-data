Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated in each iteration; `k` is len(a) - 1; `i` and `j` are values based on the comparisons made during the loop. If all elements in `a` are the same and all elements in `c` are the same and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, the condition is satisfied; otherwise, the condition is not satisfied and no further changes are made to the variables.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
