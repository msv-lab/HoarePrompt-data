Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, sorted in descending order; `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2`; `i` is 0 if `t2 > t1` else 1; `j` is 3 if `t2 > t1` else 2; `k` is incremented by 1; `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`.**

In simpler terms: **`t` remains an integer between 1 and 100; `n` and `m` retain their input values; `a` and `c` retain their sorted properties; `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 3; otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 2. In both cases, `k` is incremented by 1, and `t1` and `t2` are recalculated based on the new values of `i` and `j`.**
