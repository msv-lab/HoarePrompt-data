The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `n` and `m` by reading a line of input, splitting it into two parts, and converting each part into an integer. The initial state of `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, so after execution, they will hold the specific values provided by the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated in each iteration; `k` is len(a) - 1; `i` and `j` are values based on the comparisons made during the loop.**

In this output state, `n` and `m` have been updated to the specific integer values provided by the input, while all other variables retain their initial states.
