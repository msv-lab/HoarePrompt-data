The given code snippet updates the value of `ans` by adding the maximum of `t1` and `t2` to it. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly involved in the calculation.

Let's break down the impact of the code:
- `ans` is initially `max(t1, t2)`.
- The code updates `ans` to `ans + max(t1, t2)`.

The values of `t1`, `t2`, `j`, and `i` do not change in this code snippet. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `k` remain unchanged as well.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `ans` is `max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2)`; `k` is 1; `t1` is `abs(a[1] - c[1])`; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`; If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `j` is 3. Otherwise, `j` is 1 and `i` is either 1 or 2.**
This means `ans` is now the sum of the two maximum differences calculated between the corresponding elements of `a` and `c`.
