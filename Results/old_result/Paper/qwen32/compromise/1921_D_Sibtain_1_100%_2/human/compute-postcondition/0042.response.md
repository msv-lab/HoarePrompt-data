The provided code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` will read a line of input, split it by spaces, convert each split string to an integer, and then assign the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. 

Given the initial state, the only variable that will be affected is `a`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `c`, `ans`, `i`, `j`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, sorted in descending order; `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration; `i` is a value between 0 and len(a) - 1; `j` is a value between 1 and len(a); `k` is len(a) - 1.**
