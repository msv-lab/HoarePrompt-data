Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, sorted in descending order; `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` from the previous calculation plus the maximum of `t1` and `t2` from the current calculation; `i` is 0 if `t2 > t1` else 1; `j` is 4 if `t2 > t1` else 3; `k` is `k + 1`; `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`.**

To simplify, the postcondition can be described as: **`t` remains an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive. `n` and `m` remain unchanged. `a` and `c` remain as the sorted and descending sorted lists, respectively. `ans` is updated by adding the maximum of `t1` and `t2` from the current calculation to its previous value. `i` is set to 0 if `t2 > t1` and 1 otherwise. `j` is set to 4 if `t2 > t1` and 3 otherwise. `k` is incremented by 1. `t1` and `t2` are recalculated based on the new values of `i` and `j`.**
