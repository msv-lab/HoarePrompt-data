Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program defines a function `func_1` which reads the integers `n` and `k` for each test case, then constructs a string `s` by taking the first `k` characters of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw' and repeating this substring `n` times. This approach does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in the resulting string `s`.

Let's break down the issue:

1. **Subsequence Requirement**: The problem requires that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets must appear as subsequences in the output string. A subsequence means that the characters of a string must appear in the output string in the same order but not necessarily consecutively.

2. **Repeating Characters**: The program constructs the string by repeating the first `k` characters `n` times. For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the output is `aabb`. This does not contain all possible subsequences of length 2 using 'a' and 'b', such as "ab" and "ba".

3. **Correct Approach**: To solve this problem, we need to generate a sequence where every possible string of length `n` appears as a subsequence. This can be achieved by constructing a De Bruijn sequence for the given alphabet size `k` and sequence length `n`. A De Bruijn sequence is a cyclic sequence in which every possible string of length `n` appears as a substring, but since we need subsequences, we need to ensure all subsequences are present.

Given the function summary and the problem description, the original assessment is correct. The provided program does not ensure that all subsequences are present, and thus it does not solve the problem correctly.

Final: **False**
