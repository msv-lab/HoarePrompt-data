### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The robot starts at (1, 1).
- It moves in two steps: a free move and then a move according to the arrow in the current cell.
- The goal is to determine if the robot can reach (2, n).

#### Provided Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
        elif n == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(0, n, 2):
                if b[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
            if not no_path:
                no_path = True
                for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                    print(k)
                    if a[k] != '>':
                        no_path = False
            if no_path:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
```

#### Issues Identified in the Code:
1. **Initial Check for `b[-2] != '>'`:**
   - The code incorrectly assumes that if the second last character in the second row is not `>`, the robot cannot reach the target. This is not necessarily true. The robot can still reach (2, n) even if `b[-2]` is not `>`, as long as there is a valid path.

2. **Handling `n == 1`:**
   - The code checks if `n == 1` and prints "YES". However, the problem specifies that `n` is always even and at least 2, so this condition is never met.

3. **Checking for Valid Path:**
   - The code uses two loops to check for alternating `>` in the second row and `>` in the first row for odd indices. This logic is overly simplistic and does not consider all possible valid paths.
   - For example, consider the test case:
     ```
     4
     >><<
     >>><
     ```
     The code will print "NO" because it checks `b[-2]` and finds it to be `<`, but there is a valid path (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4).

4. **General Path Checking:**
   - The code does not simulate the robot's movements accurately. It needs to simulate the robot's movements step by step to determine if it can reach the target cell (2, n).

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The function summary suggests that the code attempts to pair each `<` with a `>` in a specific manner, but it does not fully capture the problem's requirements for simulating the robot's movements accurately.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases and fails to simulate the robot's movements accurately. The original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
