Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `i` is 1.
3. `n` is an input integer.
4. `a` is a new string input from the user.
5. `b` is a new string input from the user.
6. The state changes based on the conditions involving the second last character of `b` and the value of `n`:
   - If the second last character of `b` is not `'>'`, the state remains as described.
   - If the second last character of `b` is `'>'` and `n` is 1, the state remains as described.
   - If the second last character of `b` is `'>'` and `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `no_path` is `True`, all characters at even indices in `b` are `'>'` and all characters at odd indices `k` in `a` (where `k` ranges from 1 to `n-2` in steps of 2) are `'>'`.
   - If the second last character of `b` is `'>'` and `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `no_path` is `False`, either any character at an even index in `b` is not `'>'` or any character at an odd index `k` in `a` (where `k` ranges from 1 to `n-2` in steps of 2) is not `'>'`.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement `print('YES')` will always output the string `'YES'`, regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or the conditions described in the initial state.
- The conditions mentioned in the initial state do not affect the content of the print statement. They may affect the flow of the program in other parts but do not influence what is printed by this specific print statement.

### Conclusion:
The output of the print statement is always `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
