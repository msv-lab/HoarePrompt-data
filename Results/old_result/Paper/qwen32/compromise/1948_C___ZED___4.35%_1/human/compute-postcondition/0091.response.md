The code snippet `b = input()` updates the variable `b` with the new string input from the user. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the new string input from the user, `b` is the new string input from the user**.
