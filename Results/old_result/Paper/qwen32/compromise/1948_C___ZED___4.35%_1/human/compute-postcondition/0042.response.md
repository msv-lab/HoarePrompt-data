The `print('NO')` statement will output the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `no_path`). This is because the print statement is explicitly printing the string `'NO'` and does not depend on any other variables or conditions in the given initial state.

So, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **NO**
