Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `a` and `b` are the new string inputs from the user. If `n` is 1, the state remains as described. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `no_path` is `True`, all characters at even indices in `b` are `'>'` and no character `a[k]` for `k` in the range 1 to the largest odd number less than `n` (with step 2) is equal to `'>'`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `no_path` is `False`, either any character at an even index in `b` is not `'>'` or any character `a[k]` for `k` in the range 1 to the largest odd number less than `n` (with step 2) is not equal to `'>'`.**
