The code snippet `b = input()` assigns the value of the next input from the user to the variable `b`. The values of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input from the user, `b` is the next string input from the user.**
