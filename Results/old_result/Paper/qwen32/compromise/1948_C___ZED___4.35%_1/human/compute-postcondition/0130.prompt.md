Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. Each of the two strings representing the rows of the grid consists of exactly n characters, where each character is either '<' or '>'. There are no arrows pointing outside the grid.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    if b[-2] != '>':
        print('NO')
    elif n == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        no_path = True
        for k in range(0, n, 2):
            if b[k] != '>':
                no_path = False
        if not no_path:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                print(k)
                if a[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
        if no_path:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string input from the user, and `b` is a string input from the user. If the second last character of `b` is not `'>'`, the state remains as described. If the second last character of `b` is `'>'`, and `n` is 1, the state remains as described. If the second last character of `b` is `'>'`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `no_path` is `True`, all characters at even indices in `b` are `'>'` and all characters at odd indices `k` in `a` (where `k` ranges from 1 to `n-2` in steps of 2) are `'>'`. If the second last character of `b` is `'>'`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `no_path` is `False`, either any character at an even index in `b` is not `'>'` or any character at an odd index `k` in `a` (where `k` ranges from 1 to `n-2` in steps of 2) is not `'>'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `a` and `b` are the new string inputs from the user. If the second last character of `b` is not `'>'`, the state remains as described. If the second last character of `b` is `'>'` and `n` is 1, the state remains as described. If the second last character of `b` is `'>'` and `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `no_path` is `True`, all characters at even indices in `b` are `'>'` and all characters at odd indices `k` in `a` (where `k` ranges from 1 to `n-2` in steps of 2) are `'>'`. If the second last character of `b` is `'>'` and `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `no_path` is `False`, either any character at an even index in `b` is not `'>'` or any character at odd index `k` in `a` (where `k` ranges from 1 to `n-2` in steps of 2) is not `'>'`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and `no_path` is `True` and the second last character of `b` is not `'>'`, all characters at even indices in `b` are `'>'` and no character `a[k]` for `k` in the range 1 to the largest odd number less than `n` (with step 2) is equal to `'>'`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and `no_path` is `False` and the second last character of `b` is not `'>'`, either any character at an even index in `b` is not `'>'` or any character `a[k]` for `k` in the range 1 to the largest odd number less than `n` (with step 2) is not equal to `'>'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the new string input from the user, and `b` is the new string input from the user. If `b[-2]` is not equal to `'>'`, then no changes are made to `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, or `b`. If `b[-2]` is equal to `'>'`, and `n` is not equal to 1, then `k` is \(n - 2\) if `n` is even or \(n - 3\) if `n` is odd. If `no_path` is `True`, `no_path` remains `True` and the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `no_path` is `False` and every character at an even index in `b` is `'>'`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
