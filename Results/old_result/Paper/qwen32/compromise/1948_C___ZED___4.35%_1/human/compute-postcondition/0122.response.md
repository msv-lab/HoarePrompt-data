Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the new string input from the user, `b` is the new string input from the user, `k` is `n - 2` if `n` is even or `n - 3` if `n` is odd. If `no_path` is `False`, then `no_path` remains `False` if any character at an even index in `b` is not `'>'`; otherwise, `no_path` is set to `True`. If `no_path` is `True`, `no_path` remains `True` and the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.**
