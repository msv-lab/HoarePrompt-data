Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the new string input from the user, `b` is the new string input from the user, `no_path` is True. If the second last character of `b` is not `'>'`, the state remains as described. If the second last character of `b` is `'>'`, and `n` is 1, the state remains as described. If the second last character of `b` is `'>'`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `no_path` is `True`, all characters at even indices in `b` are `'>'` and all characters at odd indices `k` in `a` (where `k` ranges from 1 to `n-2` in steps of 2) are `'>'`. If the second last character of `b` is `'>'`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `no_path` is `False`, either any character at an even index in `b` is not `'>'` or any character at an odd index `k` in `a` (where `k` ranges from 1 to `n-2` in steps of 2) is not `'>'`.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(0, n, 2):
    if b[k] != '>':
        no_path = False


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is the new string input from the user, `b` is the new string input from the user, and if the character at index `k` of `b` is not `'>'`, then `no_path` is `False`. Otherwise, `no_path` remains `True`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is the new string input from the user, `b` is the new string input from the user, `k` is `k + 2`, and `no_path` is `False` if `b[k]` is not `'>'`. Otherwise, `no_path` retains its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is the new string input from the user, `b` is the new string input from the user, `k` is `k + 4`, and `no_path` is `False` if `b[k]` is not `'>'`. Otherwise, `no_path` retains its original value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
