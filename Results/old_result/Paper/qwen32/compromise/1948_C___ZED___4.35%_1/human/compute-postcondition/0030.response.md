To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so it doesn't affect the output.
2. **i**: Initialized to `0`. `i` is also not used in the provided code snippet.
3. **n**: An integer input greater than `2`.
4. **a**: A string input from the user. `a` is not used in the provided code snippet.
5. **b**: A string input from the user with the second-to-last character being `'>'`. `b` is not used in the provided code snippet.
6. **k**: The next value in the sequence defined by the range `(1, n-1, 2)`. This means `k` will be the first value in the sequence generated by `range(1, n-1, 2)`.

### Determining the Value of `k`:
The `range(1, n-1, 2)` generates a sequence of odd numbers starting from `1` up to but not including `n-1`, with a step of `2`. The first value in this sequence is always `1` as long as `n` is greater than `2`.

### Conclusion:
Since `k` is assigned the first value in the sequence generated by `range(1, n-1, 2)`, and the first value of this sequence is always `1` when `n > 2`, the value of `k` will be `1`.

### Output:
Output: **1**
