Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. However, the logic and implementation of the program have several issues that make it incorrect.

1. **Initial Check for Uniform Array**: The program first checks if the entire array is uniform (all elements are the same) using a flag. If the array is uniform, it correctly outputs `-1` because a uniform array will always remain beautiful no matter how many elements are removed.

2. **Finding the Minimum Segment to Remove**: The program then attempts to find the minimum number of elements to remove by iterating through the array and counting consecutive elements that are the same. However, the logic for finding the minimum segment to remove is flawed:
   - The program uses the `Decimal('Infinity')` to initialize `ans`, which is unnecessary since `ans` can be initialized to a large integer or `n` itself.
   - The program only checks segments that start with the first element's value (`val = arr[0]`) and counts how many times this value appears consecutively. It then updates `ans` with the minimum count of such segments. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider segments that start with other values and does not correctly identify the smallest segment that can be removed to make the array non-beautiful.
   - The final value of `ans` is not correctly computed because the program does not handle all possible segments and their lengths properly.

3. **Output**: The program outputs the value of `ans` if the array is not uniform, but this value is not guaranteed to be the correct minimum number of elements to remove.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. A correct solution would require a more sophisticated approach to identify the smallest segment that can be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
