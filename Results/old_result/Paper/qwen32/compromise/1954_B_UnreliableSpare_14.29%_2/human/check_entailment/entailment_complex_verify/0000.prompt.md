You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

        #This is printed: -1
    else :

        #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in arr)
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers read from input; `flag` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `arr` are the same; `ans` is the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in `arr`; `val` is the last unique element counted in the loop; `cnt` is the length of the last sequence of identical elements in `arr`. If `flag` is True, all elements in `arr` are the same. If `flag` is False, not all elements in `arr` are the same. In both cases, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in the list `a`. If all elements in `a` are the same, it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful is flawed.

Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Flag Check for Uniform Array**: The code correctly checks if the array is uniform (all elements are the same) and returns `-1` if it is. This part is correct.

2. **Counting Minimum Removals**:
   - The code attempts to count the minimum number of elements to remove by iterating through the array and updating the count when it encounters a different element.
   - However, the logic for updating the `ans` variable (which stores the minimum count of consecutive elements to remove) is incorrect. The `ans` variable is updated using the `min` function, but it does not correctly account for the need to break up the sequence of identical elements to make the array non-beautiful.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails

Consider the following input:
```
1
6
1 2 1 2 1 2
```

The correct output should be `1`, because we can remove any one element from the sequence to make it non-beautiful. For example, removing the second element results in `[1, 1, 2, 1, 2]`, which is not beautiful.

However, the provided program will output `2` for this input. Here's why:

- The program identifies that the array is not uniform.
- It then counts the lengths of consecutive elements and updates `ans` with the minimum length of such sequences.
- In this case, the program will set `ans` to `2` because the minimum length of consecutive identical elements is `2` (e.g., the sequence `1 1` or `2 2`).

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

1. Check if the array is uniform and return `-1` if it is.
2. Otherwise, iterate through the array and count the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the sequence of identical elements in such a way that the resulting array is not beautiful.

Given the complexity of correctly implementing this logic, it is clear that the provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
