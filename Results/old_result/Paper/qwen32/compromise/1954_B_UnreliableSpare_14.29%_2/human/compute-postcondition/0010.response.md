Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers read from input; `flag` is True; `ans` is the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in `arr`; `val` is the last unique element counted in the loop; `cnt` is the length of the last sequence of identical elements in `arr`; `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. Since `flag` is True, all elements in `arr` are the same.**
