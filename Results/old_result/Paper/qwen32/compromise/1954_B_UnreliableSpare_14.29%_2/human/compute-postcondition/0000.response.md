Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**

In this output state, `n` has been assigned the value of the input integer, while `t` and `a` retain their initial states as described.
