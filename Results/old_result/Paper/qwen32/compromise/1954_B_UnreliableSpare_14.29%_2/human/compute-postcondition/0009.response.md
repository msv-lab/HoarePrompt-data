The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. This means that if `cnt` is smaller than `ans`, `ans` will take the value of `cnt`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; n is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n; arr is a list of integers read from input; flag is True if all elements in arr are the same, otherwise flag is False; ans is the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in arr; val is the last unique element counted in the loop; cnt is the length of the last sequence of identical elements in arr; `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.**
