The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `arr`. This operation does not affect the variables `t` and `n` or the list `a` as described in the initial state. The only change is the introduction of a new list `arr` that will contain the integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers read from input.**
