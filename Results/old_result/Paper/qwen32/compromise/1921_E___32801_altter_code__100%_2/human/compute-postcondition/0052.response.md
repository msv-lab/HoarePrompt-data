The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'bob'`. The initial state provides detailed information about the variables and their constraints, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will be exactly the string provided in the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Print Statement**: The `print` statement is `print('bob')`.
2. **Examine the Argument**: The argument to the `print` function is a string literal `'bob'`.
3. **Determine the Output**: Since the argument is a string literal, the output will be exactly `'bob'`.

The values of the variables described in the initial state (`t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`) are not relevant to the execution of this particular `print` statement.

Output: **bob**
