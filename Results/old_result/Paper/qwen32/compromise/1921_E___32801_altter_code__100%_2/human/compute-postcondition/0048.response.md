Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **Variables and Their Definitions:**
   - `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)` after adjusting `y1` based on the condition.
   - `h` and `w` are positive integers with constraints.
   - `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are positive integers with constraints.
   - `r` is a list of integers read from input.
   - `n` is `r[0]`.
   - `m` is `r[1]`.
   - `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`.
   - `x2` is `r[4] - a`.
   - `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`.
   - `y1` is adjusted by `a` to either `y1 - a` if `y2 <= y1` or `y1 + a` if `y2 > y1`.
   - `y2` is adjusted to either 1 if `y2 <= y1` or `m` if `y2 > y1`.
   - `b` is `x2 - x1`.
   - `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - `c` is `y1 - 1` if `y2 <= y1` or `m - y1` if `y2 > y1`.
   - Additionally, either `b // 2 <= a` or `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c` or `y1` is not in the range [1, m] or `x1` is not in the range [1, n].

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('draw')`.

### Analysis

The print statement `print('draw')` is straightforward and does not depend on the values of any variables. It simply prints the string `'draw'`.

### Output

Based on the analysis, the print statement will output the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
