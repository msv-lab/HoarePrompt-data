The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Alice'`. The initial state provides a detailed description of the variables and their constraints, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'Alice'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes several variables and their properties, such as `t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`.
2. The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print('Alice')`.
3. The string `'Alice'` is a literal and does not depend on any of the variables described in the initial state.

Output: **Alice**
