The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `num2`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `num2`. If `i` is less than `num2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's call it `i_end`), and `num2` is the length of the list `a`.

Given the loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `num2 - 1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i_end` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be `i_end + 1`. The value of `num2` remains the same as it represents the length of the list `a`.

State: **`a` is a list of integers where `2 <= len(a) <= 100` and `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for all `i`. `num2` is an integer representing the length of the list `a` such that `num2 == len(a)`. If `a[i - 1] >= a[i]`, then `order` is 1; otherwise, `order` remains 0. `i` is `i_end + 1` where `i_end` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.**

Since we do not know the exact value of `i_end` from the given state, we can express the state as:
State: **`a` is a list of integers where `2 <= len(a) <= 100` and `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for all `i`. `num2` is an integer representing the length of the list `a` such that `num2 == len(a)`. If `a[i - 1] >= a[i]`, then `order` is 1; otherwise, `order` remains 0. `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
