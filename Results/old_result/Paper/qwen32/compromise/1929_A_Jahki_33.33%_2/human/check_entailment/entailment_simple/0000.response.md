### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the maximum beauty of an array after rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, specifically (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n.

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements. It then checks if the array is already sorted in strictly increasing order using the `func_1` function. If the array is already sorted in strictly increasing order, it outputs `0` because no rearrangement will increase the beauty. Otherwise, it sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

Let's break down the logic and correctness:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the array is already in strictly increasing order.
   - It increments a counter `order` if any element is greater than or equal to the next element.
   - If `order` is `0` (meaning no such pair exists), it returns `True` indicating the array is already sorted in strictly increasing order.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **Main Program:**
   - For each test case, it reads the array length `n` and the array elements.
   - It checks if the array is already sorted in strictly increasing order using `func_1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints `0` because no rearrangement can increase the beauty.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

The program correctly handles the given problem by:
- Checking if the array is already sorted in strictly increasing order.
- Sorting the array if it is not sorted and calculating the beauty.

### Correctness:
The logic of the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided examples. The program correctly identifies when the array is already sorted and when it needs to be rearranged to maximize the beauty. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
