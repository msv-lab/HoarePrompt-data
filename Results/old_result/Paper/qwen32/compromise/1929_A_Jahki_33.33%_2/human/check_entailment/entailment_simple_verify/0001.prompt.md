You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
    if order == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Annotated Code: 
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]

        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i. num2 is an integer representing the length of the list a, such that num2 == len(a).
def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):

    if (order == 0) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    else :

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. The beauty is calculated as:
\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

To maximize this sum, the optimal strategy is to sort the array in ascending order, as this will maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.

2. **Sorting and Calculation:**
   - The array is sorted in ascending order.
   - The beauty is calculated by summing up the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Output:**
   - If the array is already sorted (`func_1(a, num2)` returns `True`), the program outputs `0`, which is incorrect as it should compute the beauty even if the array is sorted.
   - Otherwise, it calculates and outputs the beauty as described.

### Issues in the Program:
- The function `func_1` is unnecessary for the problem. The beauty should always be calculated regardless of whether the array is sorted or not.
- The condition `if func_1(a, num2): print(0)` is incorrect. The beauty should be calculated and printed in all cases.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the program, we should remove the unnecessary function `func_1` and always compute the beauty.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the unnecessary check and incorrect handling of already sorted arrays.

Correctness: **False**
