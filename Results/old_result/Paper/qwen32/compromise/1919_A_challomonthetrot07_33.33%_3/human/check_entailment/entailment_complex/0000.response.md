To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic provided in the `func` function against the problem description and the provided example outputs.

The game's rules and optimal play strategies need to be considered. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the problem and how the program handles it:

1. **Initial Considerations**:
    - The game ends when a player cannot make a move, which happens when both wallets are empty.
    - Players can choose to swap wallets or not, and then they must remove one coin from their current wallet.

2. **Optimal Play**:
    - If both wallets have the same number of coins, the second player (Bob) can always mirror the actions of the first player (Alice), ensuring that he wins.
    - If one of the wallets has only one coin, the player with the single coin will lose because they must remove the coin, leaving the opponent with a non-empty wallet.
    - If Alice has an odd number of coins and Bob has an even number, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by ensuring he is left with an odd number of coins each time.
    - If both wallets have an even number of coins, the player who starts (Alice) can always force the other player (Bob) into a losing position by mirroring the actions or ensuring the opponent is left with an odd number of coins in one of the wallets.

3. **Program Logic Analysis**:
    - **Case 1: `a == b`**: The program correctly outputs 'Bob' because if both wallets have the same number of coins, Bob can mirror Alice's moves and win.
    - **Case 2: `a == 1`**: The program correctly outputs 'Alice' because Alice will remove the single coin, leaving Bob with no valid move.
    - **Case 3: `b == 1`**: The program correctly outputs 'Bob' because Alice will swap wallets if possible, leaving Bob with the single coin, which he will have to remove, leading to Alice's win.
    - **Case 4: `a % 2 == 1`**: The program correctly outputs 'Bob' because Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by ensuring he is left with an odd number of coins.
    - **Case 5: `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1`**: The program correctly outputs 'Alice' because Alice can force Bob into a losing position by ensuring he is left with an odd number of coins.
    - **Case 6: `a > b`**: This case is not explicitly handled but seems to be part of the general strategy where Alice can potentially win if she starts with more coins and both are even, or if she can force Bob into a losing position.
    - **Case 7: `else`**: This case seems to handle the remaining scenarios where Alice can win if she starts with an even number of coins and Bob has an even number of coins, or if she can force Bob into a losing position.

However, the logic in the program does not fully cover all scenarios correctly. Specifically, the conditions `elif a % 2 == 1` and `elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1` do not fully capture the optimal play strategies for all cases. For example, if `a` and `b` are both even and `a > b`, the program outputs 'Bob', which is not always correct.

Given the provided example outputs and the analysis of the problem, the program does not handle all scenarios correctly.

**Conclusion**: The given program does not cover all possible scenarios correctly, and therefore, it is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
