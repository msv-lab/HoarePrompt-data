Output State: **`sng` must contain at least two elements, `sz` is incremented by 1. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking.**

Natural Language: The value of `sz` has been incremented by 1. The condition to check if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` to break out of the loop or if statement remains the same. The precondition that `sng` must contain at least two elements is still valid.
