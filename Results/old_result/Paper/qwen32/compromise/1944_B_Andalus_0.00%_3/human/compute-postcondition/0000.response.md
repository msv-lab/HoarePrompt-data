The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `T`. This integer `T` represents the number of test cases. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, but after executing the code, `T` takes the value of the input, and `t` is no longer mentioned in the context of the code snippet provided. Therefore, the new state includes `T` with the value of the input, and the other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`) remain as they were described in the initial state but are not yet assigned values.

Output State: **`T` is the input integer representing the number of test cases; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50,000, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, and `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 50,000.**
