The code appends the value of `lft[i]` to the list `ldb`. Given that `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, the value being appended to `ldb` is the same as the previous element in `lft`. Therefore, `ldb` will now contain one additional element, which is the same as `lft[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is a list containing `lft[i - 1]` as its last element, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, and `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`.**
