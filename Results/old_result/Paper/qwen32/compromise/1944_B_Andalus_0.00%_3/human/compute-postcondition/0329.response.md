Output State: **`sz` is either 0 or 2, `rdb` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the next element in `rdb` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `sz`, `rdb`, and `elem` remain unchanged. The only impact is that the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
