To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the provided print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`sz`**: This variable is the largest even number less than or equal to `k`. However, the value of `k` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `sz`. The only thing we know is that `sz` will be an even number and it will be the largest even number less than or equal to `k`.
2. **`sng`**: This is a list with at least one element. Since it is mentioned that `sng` has at least one element, we can assume `sng` is not empty.
3. **`elem`**: This variable is the first element of the list `sng`. Since `sng` has at least one element, `elem` will definitely have a value which is the first element of `sng`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```
This statement will print the value of `elem` followed by a space. The `end=' '` argument specifies that the print statement should end with a space instead of a newline.

### Output Explanation:
Since `elem` is the first element of the list `sng` and `sng` has at least one element, the print statement will output the value of `elem` followed by a space.

### Final Output:
Given the information, the output of the print statement will be the first element of the list `sng` followed by a space.

Output: **[elem] (where elem is the first element of the list `sng`)**
