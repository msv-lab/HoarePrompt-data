The `break` statement will exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `sz`, `all elements up to the point where sz equals k have been printed from sng`, `rdb`, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `sng`, `i`, and `elem` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sz` is 0 or 2, all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`, `rdb` is a list containing elements from `rgt[1]` to `rgt[n-1]` that are equal to their preceding element, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end, `ldb` is a list containing at least two elements, `sng` contains elements from `lft` that are unique in their position, `i` is `n-1`, `elem` is the third element in `ldb` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
