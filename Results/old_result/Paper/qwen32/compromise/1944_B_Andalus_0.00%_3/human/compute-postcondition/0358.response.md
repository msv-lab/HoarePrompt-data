To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes the input and outputs the results. The loop processes each test case independently, and for each test case, it performs the following steps:

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the values of `n` and `k`, and the list `a` of 2n integers.
2. **Splitting the List**: Split the list `a` into two halves, `lft` and `rgt`.
3. **Sorting**: Sort both `lft` and `rgt`.
4. **Identifying Duplicates and Singles**:
   - `ldb` stores the duplicate values from `lft`.
   - `rdb` stores the duplicate values from `rgt`.
   - `sng` stores the single values from `lft` that do not have a pair.
5. **Printing Values**:
   - First, print pairs from `ldb` until `sz` (a counter) reaches `k`.
   - If `sz` is still less than `k`, print values from `sng` until `sz` reaches `k`.
   - Repeat the process for `rdb` and `sng`.

Given that the loop processes each test case independently and the state of variables is reset for each test case, the final output state after all iterations is determined by the completion of each test case. Specifically, for each test case, the loop ensures that exactly `k` values are printed, either as pairs from `ldb` or as singles from `sng`.

### Output State After All Iterations:
The output state after all iterations will be that for each test case, exactly `k` values have been printed, and no further values are printed for that test case. The variables `ldb`, `rdb`, `sng`, and `sz` are reset for each new test case, so they do not carry over between test cases.

**Output State: **After all iterations, for each test case, exactly `k` values have been printed, and no further values are printed for that test case. The variables `ldb`, `rdb`, `sng`, and `sz` are reset for each new test case.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that each test case has printed exactly `k` values, and the loop has completed all its iterations without any leftover values to print for any test case.
