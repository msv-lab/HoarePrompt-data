To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given `print` statement and the initial state provided:

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `T` is an integer greater than 0.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
- `lst` is a list of integers from the input.
- `lft` is a sorted list containing the first n elements of `lst`.
- `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end and must have at least one pair of consecutive identical elements.
- `ldb` is an empty list or contains elements that were not processed because `sz` reached `k`.
- `sng` contains the remaining elements in `lft` that are not part of a consecutive pair and are not at the boundaries of such pairs after printing up to `k` elements.
- `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that appear twice consecutively and must have at least one element.
- `i` is `n`.
- `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, meaning there is enough capacity to process at least two more elements.

However, the variable `elem` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine its exact value from the given information. We can only infer that `elem` is some variable that holds some value that will be printed twice, separated by a space, and no newline character will be added at the end due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Given this, the most precise description we can provide is that the code prints the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space.

Output: **elem elem** (where `elem` is the value of the variable `elem`)
