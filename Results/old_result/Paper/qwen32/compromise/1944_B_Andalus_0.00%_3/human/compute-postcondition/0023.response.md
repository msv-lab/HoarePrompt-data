Postcondition: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `lft[i] == lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` has an additional element `lft[i]` appended to it. If `i < n - 1` and `lft[i] != lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` contains the element at index `i` of `lft`. Otherwise, `sng` remains unchanged.**
