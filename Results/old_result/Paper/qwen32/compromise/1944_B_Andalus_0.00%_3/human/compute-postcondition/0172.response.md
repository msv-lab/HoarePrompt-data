To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the provided initial state and the context of the variables involved.

### Analysis of Initial State:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `sz` is initialized to 0.
   - `rdb` is a list containing elements from `rgt[1]` to `rgt[n-1]` that are equal to their preceding element.
   - `T` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1.
   - `k` is the second integer from the input.
   - `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`.
   - `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end.
   - `ldb` is a list containing at least two elements.
   - `sng` contains elements from `lft` that are unique in their position.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `elem` is the second element in `ldb`.

2. **Condition:**
   - The execution continues if `sz` is not greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, the loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Focus on the `print` Statement:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

From the initial state, we know that:
- `elem` is the second element in the list `ldb`.

### Output Explanation:
The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, and will not add a newline at the end due to `end=' '`.

Since the exact values of `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, and `elem` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `elem`.

### Final Output:
Output: **elem elem (where elem is the second element in the list `ldb`)**
