Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `sz` is 0; all elements from `sng` up to the point where `sz` becomes equal to or greater than `k` are printed.
Code of the loop:
for elem in rdb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sz` is either 0 or 2, `rdb` must contain at least one element. If `sz` is 2, the current value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `sz` is either 0, 2, 4, or the value remains unchanged if it is already greater than or equal to `k`. `rdb` must contain at least one element, and `elem` is the next element in `rdb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to `rdb` or `elem`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `sz` is either 0, 2, 4, 6, or remains unchanged if it was already greater than or equal to `k`. `rdb` must contain at least two elements, and `elem` is the next element in `rdb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to `rdb` or `elem`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
