Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer greater than 0, n is greater than 1, k is the second integer from the input, a is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, lst is a list of integers from the input, lft is a sorted list containing the first n elements of lst, rgt is a sorted list containing the elements of lst from index n to the end, ldb is an empty list (or contains elements that were not processed because sz reached k), sng contains all elements in lft that are not part of a consecutive pair and are not at the boundaries of such pairs, rdb contains all elements in rgt that appear twice consecutively, i is n, sz is the largest even number less than or equal to k.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first n elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list (or contains elements that were not processed because `sz` reached `k`), `sng` contains at least one element that is in `lft` and is not part of a consecutive pair and is not at the boundaries of such pairs, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that appear twice consecutively, `i` is `n`, `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus one. If `sz` is now equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first n elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list (or contains elements that were not processed because `sz` reached `k`), `sng` contains at least two elements that are in `lft` and are not part of a consecutive pair and are not at the boundaries of such pairs, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that appear twice consecutively, `i` is `n`, `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus two. If `sz` is equal to `k + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first n elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list (or contains elements that were not processed because `sz` reached `k`), `sng` contains at least two elements that are in `lft` and are not part of a consecutive pair and are not at the boundaries of such pairs, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that appear twice consecutively, `i` is `n`, `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus three, `elem` is the second element of `sng`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
