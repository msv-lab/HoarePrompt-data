The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Since the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- `T` is an integer greater than 0
- `n` is greater than 1
- `k` is the second integer from the input
- `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice
- `lst` is a list of integers from the input
- `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`
- `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end
- If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `ldb` contains `lft[i - 1]` as its last element, and `rdb` and `sng` are empty lists. Otherwise, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, and `sng` contains `lft[i]` if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value between `1` and `n-2` (inclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `i` is incremented by 1, `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` are as per the conditions described**.

Since the exact values of `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` depend on the specific values in `lft` and the position of `i`, we can't specify their exact values without more information. However, we know `i` should be incremented by 1.

Final State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `i` is incremented by 1**.
