The code snippet `rgt = lst[n:]` slices the list `lst` starting from the index `n` to the end of the list, and assigns this slice to the variable `rgt`. The other variables (`T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `lst`, and `lft`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, and `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`. After executing the code, `rgt` will contain the elements of `lst` starting from the index `n` to the end.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, and `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end.**
