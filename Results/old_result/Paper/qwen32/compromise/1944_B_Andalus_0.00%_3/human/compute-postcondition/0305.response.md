The provided initial state does not mention any variable named `elem`. The precondition only describes the integers `sz` and `k`, and a condition related to these variables. However, the print statement attempts to print a variable `elem` which is not defined based on the given information.

Since `elem` is not defined in the provided initial state, it is impossible to determine what value it holds. Therefore, the print statement will result in a `NameError` because `elem` is not recognized.

However, if we assume that `elem` is supposed to be a variable that is defined elsewhere in the code (which is not shown here), we cannot determine its value based on the given precondition.

Given the information provided, the most accurate and precise description of the output is that a `NameError` will occur due to the undefined variable `elem`.

Output: **NameError: name 'elem' is not defined**
