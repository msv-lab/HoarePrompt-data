To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables `rdb` and `i`.

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1` (inclusive). During each iteration, the loop checks if the current element in `rgt` is equal to the previous element. If they are equal, it appends the current element to `rdb`.

Given that `i` starts at 1 and goes up to `n-1`, the loop will execute `n-1` times. The final value of `i` after the loop will be `n-1`.

Here's the final state of the variables:
- `sz` remains equal to `k`.
- All elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`.
- `rdb` will contain all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, from `rgt[1]` to `rgt[n-1]`.
- `T` remains greater than 0.
- `n` and `k` remain the same as the input values.
- `lst` remains the same list of integers obtained from the input.
- `lft` remains the sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`.
- `rgt` remains the sorted list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end.
- `ldb` remains an empty list.
- `sng` remains the list containing elements from `lft` that are unique in their position.
- `i` will be `n-1` after the loop completes.

Output State: **`sz` is equal to `k`, all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`, `rdb` is a list containing elements from `rgt[1]` to `rgt[n-1]` that are equal to their preceding element, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` contains elements from `lft` that are unique in their position, and `i` is `n-1`.**
