Output State: **`elem` is the next element in `ldb`. If `sz + 2 >= k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking out of the loop or if statement. `sz` is increased by 2.**

Natural Language: The value of `sz` is increased by 2. The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is now `sz + 2 >= k`. The value of `elem` remains the next element in `ldb`.
