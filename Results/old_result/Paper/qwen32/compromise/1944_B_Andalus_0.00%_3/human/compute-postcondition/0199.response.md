The given Python code snippet contains a `print()` statement with no arguments. In Python, when `print()` is called without any arguments, it outputs a newline character.

Based on the initial state provided, `sz` is `k` and the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed. However, these details do not affect the behavior of the `print()` statement in this specific case. The `print()` statement will simply move to the next line.

Therefore, the output will be a newline character.

Output: **(newline)**
