The code appends the element at index `i` of `lft` to the list `ldb`. Therefore, `ldb` now contains at least one more element, specifically `lft[i]`.

Output State: **`sz` is equal to `k`, all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`, `rdb` is a list that now includes `lft[i]`, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end, `i` is `k + 2`.**
