The code appends the element at index `i` of the list `rgt` to the list `rdb`. Given that `i` is 3, the element `rgt[3]` is appended to `rdb`.

Output State: **`sz` is equal to `k`, all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`, `rdb` is a list containing the elements `rgt[1]`, `rgt[2]`, and `rgt[3]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]` for all `i` from 2 to 3, otherwise `rdb` contains `rgt[1]` and `rgt[3]`, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` contains elements from `lft` that are unique in their position, and `i` is 3.**
