Postcondition: **`sz` is incremented by 1. If `sz` was initially equal to `k` (and `k` is even), then `sz` is now `k + 1` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sz` is now an odd number greater than the largest even number less than `k`. `rdb` and `sng` remain unchanged. `sng` must have at least one more element. `elem` is the next element in `sng`. If `sz` is not greater than or equal to `k`, the program does not break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
