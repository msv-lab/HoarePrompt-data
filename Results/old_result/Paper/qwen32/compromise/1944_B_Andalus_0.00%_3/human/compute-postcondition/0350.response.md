Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Description**:
   - `sz` is incremented by 1.
   - If `sz` was initially equal to `k` (and `k` is even), then `sz` is now `k + 1` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - Otherwise, `sz` is now an odd number greater than the largest even number less than `k`.
   - `rdb` and `sng` remain unchanged.
   - `sng` must have at least one more element.
   - `elem` is the next element in `sng`.
   - If `sz` is not greater than or equal to `k`, the program does not break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(elem, end=' ')`. This means it will print the value of `elem` followed by a space, and it will not add a newline character at the end.

3. **Determine the Value of `elem`**:
   - According to the initial state, `elem` is defined as the next element in the list `sng`. Since `sng` must have at least one more element, `elem` will be the first element in the remaining part of `sng` after any previous elements have been processed.

4. **Output**:
   - The print statement will output the value of `elem` followed by a space.

Since the exact value of `elem` is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe it in terms of its role in the list `sng`.

Output: **elem (where elem is the next element in the list `sng`)**
