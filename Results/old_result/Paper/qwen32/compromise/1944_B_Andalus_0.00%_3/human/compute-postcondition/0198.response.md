To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and the conditions given:

1. The loop iterates over each element in the list `sng`.
2. For each element `elem` in `sng`, if `sz` is less than `k`, it prints `elem` and increments `sz` by 1.
3. The loop breaks if `sz` becomes greater than or equal to `k`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we know:
- `sng` must contain at least 3 elements for the loop to run 3 times.
- After 3 iterations, `sz` would be 3.

The loop will continue to iterate and print elements from `sng` until `sz` reaches `k`. Therefore, the final state of `sz` will be `k`, and the loop will have printed the first `k` elements of `sng`.

Output State: **`sz` is `k`, and the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `sz` will be equal to `k`, and the first `k` unique elements from the list `sng` will have been printed. The state of other variables like `n`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, and `rdb` will remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
