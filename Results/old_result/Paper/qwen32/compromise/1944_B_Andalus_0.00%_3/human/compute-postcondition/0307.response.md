The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem` from the iterable `sng`. Therefore, we can only adjust `elem` to prepare for the next iteration. However, the state of `sz` and `k` are also relevant to determine if the loop should continue executing.

At the end of the previous iteration, `sz` is an integer that has been incremented by 1, and `k` is an integer. If the original value of `sz` was greater than or equal to `k`, the loop would have broken. Otherwise, `sz` was incremented by 1, and no changes were made to `k`.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `sz` must still be less than `k` after the increment. Since `sz` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the loop to continue, the new value of `sz` (which is the original `sz` plus 1) must be less than `k`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the incremented `sz` and ensure that `sz` is still less than `k`.

State: **`sz` is an integer incremented by 1 and still less than `k`, `k` is an integer, and `elem` is the next element in `sng`**
