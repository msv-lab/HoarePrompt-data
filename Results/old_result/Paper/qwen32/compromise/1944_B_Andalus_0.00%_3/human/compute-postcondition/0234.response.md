Output State: **`sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus 2, `sng` is a list with at least three elements, `elem` is the third element of `sng`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms, `sz`, `sng`, and `elem` retain their original values, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
