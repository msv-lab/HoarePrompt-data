The code sorts the list `lft`. This means the elements of `lft` will be rearranged in ascending order. The other variables (`sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sz` is `k`, the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed; `n` and `k` are set to the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input; `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`; `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`; `ldb` is an empty list; `rdb` is an empty list; `sng` is an empty list.**
