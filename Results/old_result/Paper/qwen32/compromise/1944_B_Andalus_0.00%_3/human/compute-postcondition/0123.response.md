The code snippet `lft = lst[:n]` creates a new list `lft` that contains the first `n` elements from the list `lst`. The other variables `sz`, `k`, `rdb`, `T`, and `n` remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `n` is the first integer from the input.

Output State: **`sz` is equal to `k`, all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`, `rdb` is empty if all elements in `rdb` have been processed, otherwise it contains the remaining elements, `T` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`.**
