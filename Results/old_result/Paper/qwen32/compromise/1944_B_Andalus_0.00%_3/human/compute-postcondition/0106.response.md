Postcondition: **`sng` must contain at least one element, `sz` is equal to `k` if `k` is achievable with the number of pairs in `rdb`, otherwise `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the current value of `sz` remains unchanged, `rdb` is empty if all elements in `rdb` have been processed, otherwise it contains the remaining elements. All other variables remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `sz` is less than `k`, there is no else part to execute, and the state of `sng`, `sz`, and `rdb` remains as per the precondition.**
