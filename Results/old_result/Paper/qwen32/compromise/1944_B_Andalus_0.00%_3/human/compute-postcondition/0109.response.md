The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem` and the iterable `sng`. Since the loop iterates over `sng`, we need to adjust the state of `sng` and `elem` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `sng` must contain at least one element, and `sz` is now `sz + 1`. Since we have just processed one element, `sng` should still contain at least one element for the loop to execute again. The variable `elem` will be the next element in `sng`.

Given that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, we assume that the current iteration has completed, and we are preparing for the next iteration.

State: **`sng` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the next element in `sng`, `sz` is `sz + 1`, `rdb` is empty if all elements in `rdb` have been processed, otherwise it contains the remaining elements. All other variables remain unchanged.**
