The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. Specifically, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the range starts from 1 and goes up to, but does not include, `n`.

Before the loop starts, `i` is set to `n`. However, for the loop to begin executing, `i` should be set to the starting value of the range, which is 1. The value of `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure that the loop body executes at least once.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`sz` is equal to `k`, all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`, `rdb` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` contains elements from `lft` that are unique in their position, and `i` is 1**
