To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`sz`**: This variable is initialized to 0. It is used to track how many elements have been printed from `sng`.
2. **`k`**: This variable is set to a value provided by the input and represents the number of elements to be printed from `sng`.
3. **`lst`**: This is a list of integers provided by the input.
4. **`lft`**: This is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
5. **`rgt`**: This is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`.
6. **`ldb`**: This list contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates. According to the precondition, `ldb` must have at least one element.
7. **`rdb`**: This list contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates consecutively.
8. **`sng`**: This list contains all elements in `lft` that appear exactly once and are not part of a sequence of duplicates.
9. **`i`**: This variable is initialized to `n-1` and is used as an index.
10. **`elem`**: This variable holds the next element in `ldb`.

### Analysis:
- The `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, and will not move to a new line after printing.
- `elem` is defined as the next element in `ldb`. Since `ldb` contains elements that have duplicates in `lft`, `elem` will be one of these duplicate elements.

### Output:
Based on the given initial state, the output of the `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement will be the value of `elem` printed twice, separated by a space.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the next element in ldb)**

This output reflects the fact that `elem` is a specific element in `ldb`, and it will be printed twice as specified in the `print` statement.
