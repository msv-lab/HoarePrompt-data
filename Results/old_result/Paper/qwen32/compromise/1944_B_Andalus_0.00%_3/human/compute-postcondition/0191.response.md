To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the provided initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `sng` is a list that must contain at least two elements.
2. `sz` is incremented by 1.
3. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
4. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing a variable `elem` followed by a space, as specified by `end=' '`.
- The variable `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is likely being used within a loop where it iterates over elements of the list `sng`.
- The exact value of `elem` depends on the context in which the `print` statement is called, specifically which iteration of the loop it is in.
- Since `sng` must contain at least two elements, `elem` could be any of those elements during different iterations.

### Conclusion:
Given the information, we can describe the output as the current value of `elem` followed by a space. Since the exact value of `elem` is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe it in terms of the list `sng`.

Output: **elem (where elem is the current element being iterated over in the list `sng`) followed by a space**
