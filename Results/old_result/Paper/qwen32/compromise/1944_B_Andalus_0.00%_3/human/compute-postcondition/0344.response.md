Postcondition: **`sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k`, or exactly `k` if `k` is even. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All elements from `rdb` up to the point where `sz` becomes equal to or greater than `k` are printed in pairs, and `sng` must contain at least one element.**
