Output State: **`sz` is 2, `rdb` must contain at least one element. The current value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 2, so `sz` becomes 2. The conditions regarding `rdb` and the relationship between `k` and `sz` are still valid, with the updated value of `sz`.
