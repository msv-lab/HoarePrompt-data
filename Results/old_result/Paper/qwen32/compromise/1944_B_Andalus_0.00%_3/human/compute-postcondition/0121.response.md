The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. This operation does not affect the values of `sz`, `sng`, `rdb`, or `T` as they are not mentioned in the code snippet. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of `n` and `k` based on the input.

Output State: **`sz` is equal to `k`, all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`, `rdb` is empty if all elements in `rdb` have been processed, otherwise it contains the remaining elements, `T` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input.**
