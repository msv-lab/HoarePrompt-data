Output State: **`sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k`, and `sz` is equal to `k`. `sng` is a list with at least one element, and `elem` is the first element of `sng`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The values of `sz`, `k`, `sng`, and `elem` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
