The only variable in the loop head is `elem`, which is used to iterate over the elements of `sng`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `sng`. If `sng` contains more elements, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `sng` must contain at least one element, and `sz` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must contain more than one element. The variable `elem` will take the next element in `sng`.

State: **`sng` must contain at least two elements, `sz` is incremented by 1**
