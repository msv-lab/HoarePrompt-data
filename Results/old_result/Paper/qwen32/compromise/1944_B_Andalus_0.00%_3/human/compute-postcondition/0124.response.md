Output State: **`sz` is equal to `k`, all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`, `rdb` is empty if all elements in `rdb` have been processed, otherwise it contains the remaining elements, `T` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`, `rgt` is a list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end.**

In simpler terms, the variable `rgt` is now assigned the elements of the list `lst` starting from the index `n` to the end of the list. All other variables retain their initial states.
