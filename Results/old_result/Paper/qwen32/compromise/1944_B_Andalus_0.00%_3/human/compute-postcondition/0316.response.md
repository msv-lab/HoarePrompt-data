The value of `sz` is incremented by 1. Initially, `sz` is an integer incremented by 2 and still less than `k`. After the increment, `sz` is now an integer that is still less than `k` but one more than its previous value. The values of `k` and `elem` remain unchanged. The condition to break out of the loop or if statement (`if sz is not greater than or equal to k`) is still valid since `sz` is incremented but is still less than `k`.

Output State: **`sz` is an integer incremented by 3 and still less than `k`, `k` is an integer, and `elem` is the subsequent element in `sng`.**
