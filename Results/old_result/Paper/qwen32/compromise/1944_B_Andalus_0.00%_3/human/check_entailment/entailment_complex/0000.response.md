### Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem by constructing two arrays `l` and `r` from the given array `a` such that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` equals the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`. Here is a detailed analysis of the logic and correctness of the provided code:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list `a` of `2n` integers.

2. **Splitting the List:**
   - The list `a` is split into two halves, `lft` (first `n` elements) and `rgt` (last `n` elements).

3. **Identifying Duplicates and Singles:**
   - `ldb` (left duplicates) stores elements that appear twice in the first half.
   - `rdb` (right duplicates) stores elements that appear twice in the second half.
   - `sng` (singles) stores elements that appear exactly once in the first half (and implicitly the second half, as every element from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice in `a`).

4. **Constructing `l` and `r`:**
   - The program attempts to construct `l` and `r` by first adding pairs of duplicate elements from `ldb` and `rdb` until `k` elements are added.
   - It then adds single elements from `sng` to `l` and `r` until `k` elements are added.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints `l` and `r` for each test case.

### Issues:
1. **Missing Elements in `sng`:**
   - The code does not correctly handle the case where `sng` needs to be used to fill up `l` and `r` when there are not enough duplicates.
   - Specifically, the code only checks for singles in the left half (`lft`). It should also check for singles in the right half (`rgt`) to ensure `sng` is complete with all elements that appear exactly once in `a`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of `sng`:**
   - The code prints elements from `sng` for both `l` and `r` without ensuring that the elements are distinct between `l` and `r`. This can lead to incorrect results where the bitwise XOR of `l` and `r` do not match.

3. **Incomplete Handling of `k`:**
   - The code might not correctly handle cases where `k` is odd and there are not enough duplicates to fill `l` and `r` completely.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided program does not guarantee the correct construction of `l` and `r` such that their bitwise XOR values are equal. Therefore, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
