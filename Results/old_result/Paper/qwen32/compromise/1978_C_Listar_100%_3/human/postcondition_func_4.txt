The function `func_5` accepts a list `l` of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, where each integer is distinct and in the range from 1 to `n`. It prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l` on the same line, separated by spaces, and then prints an empty line. The function returns `None`.
