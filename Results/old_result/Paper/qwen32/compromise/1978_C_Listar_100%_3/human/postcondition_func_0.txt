The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer, and `k`, a non-negative integer. It returns a list that has been modified based on the values of `n` and `k`. The final state of the program is a list `l` that has undergone transformations through iterations and calls to `func_3`. The function may also return early if `k` becomes 0 or less than `i - 1` during the process.
