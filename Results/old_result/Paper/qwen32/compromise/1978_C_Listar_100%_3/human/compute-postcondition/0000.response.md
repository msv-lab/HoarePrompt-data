The code snippet `n, k = func_4()` indicates that `n` and `k` will be assigned the values returned by the function `func_4()`. Given that `func_4()` is not defined in the provided context, we can only assume that it returns two values, which will be assigned to `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies the constraints on `n` and `k`.

Since the function `func_4()` returns two values, these values will replace the previous values of `n` and `k`. The new values of `n` and `k` are determined by the return values of `func_4()`, and we do not have specific values for these return values. However, we can state that after the execution, `n` and `k` will hold the values returned by `func_4()`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`.**
