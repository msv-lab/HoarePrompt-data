You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^{5}), and k is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}).
def func_4():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (k % 2) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns 0, 0
    #State: `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, and `k` is an even number
    if (n % 2) :
        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2
    else :
        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    #State: `n` is the first integer read from the input and `k` is the second integer read from the input, with `k` being an even number. If `n` is odd, `max_k` is set to `n`. Otherwise, if `n` is even, `max_k` is also set to `n`.
    if (max_k < k) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns 0, 0
    #State: `n` is the first integer read from the input and `k` is the second integer read from the input, with `k` being an even number. `max_k` is set to `n`. Additionally, `max_k` is not less than `k`.
    return n, k
    #The program returns the tuple (n, k), where n is the first integer read from the input and k is the second integer read from the input, with k being an even number.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns a tuple based on the values of `n` and `k` read from the input. If the conditions for Case_1 or Case_2 are met, it returns (0, 0). Otherwise, if `k` is an even number, it returns the tuple (n, k).

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0, 0

Case_2: The program returns 0, 0

Case_3: The program returns the tuple (n, k), where n is the first integer read from the input and k is the second integer read from the input, with k being an even number.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
