The provided code snippet consists of a single line that calls a function `func_5(l)`. This function call does not return a value, nor does it modify any of the existing variables `n`, `k`, or `l` directly. The values of `n` and `k` are initially set by `func_4()`, and `l` is set by `func_1(n, k)`. Since `func_5(l)` does not affect these variables, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`. `n` is not equal to 0; `l` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k)`.**
