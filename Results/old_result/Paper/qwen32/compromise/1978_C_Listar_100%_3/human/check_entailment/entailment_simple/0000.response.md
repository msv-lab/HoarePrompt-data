### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify if it correctly solves the problem of finding a permutation with a given Manhattan value.

1. **Input Handling (`func_4`)**:
   - The function reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It checks if `k` is odd. If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` because the Manhattan value for any permutation is always even.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` for the given `n`. If `n` is odd, `max_k` is `(n ** 2 - 1) // 2`. If `n` is even, `max_k` is `n ** 2 // 2`.
   - If `k` is greater than `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)` because it's impossible to achieve such a Manhattan value.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

2. **Permutation Generation (`func_1`)**:
   - The function starts with the identity permutation `l = [1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - It iterates from `n` down to `1` with a step of `-2`.
   - For each iteration, it checks if `k` is zero or less than `i - 1`. If so, it calls `func_2` to make a specific swap and returns the permutation.
   - If `k` is still greater than `i - 1`, it subtracts `i - 1` from `k` and calls `func_3` to swap elements in the permutation.
   - The function continues until `k` is zero or less than `i - 1`.

3. **Swapping Elements (`func_2`)**:
   - This function swaps the elements at positions `-c` and `-c - k` in the list `l`.

4. **Swapping Elements (`func_3`)**:
   - This function swaps the elements at positions `c - 1` and `-c` in the list `l`.

5. **Output (`func_5`)**:
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the permutation.

6. **Main Function (`func_6`)**:
   - It calls `func_4` to get `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is zero (which means `k` was odd or too large), it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to get the permutation and then calls `func_5` to print the result.

### Analysis:

- The program correctly handles the case where `k` is odd by returning "NO".
- It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value correctly.
- It generates permutations by adjusting the permutation step by step, ensuring that the Manhattan value is exactly `k`.
- The swapping functions (`func_2` and `func_3`) ensure that the permutation is adjusted correctly to achieve the desired Manhattan value.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly solves the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and generates valid permutations with the required Manhattan value.

**Correctness: True**
