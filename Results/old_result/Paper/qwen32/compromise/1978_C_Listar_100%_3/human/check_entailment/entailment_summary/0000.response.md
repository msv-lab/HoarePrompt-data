### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if a permutation of length `n` exists such that its Manhattan value equals `k`.
   - The Manhattan value is calculated as the sum of absolute differences between each element in the permutation and its position index.
   - The problem specifies that `k` must be even, and if `k` is odd, no such permutation can exist.

2. **Analyzing the Functions:**
   - **Function 4 (`func_4`)**: This function reads `n` and `k` from the input and checks if `k` is even and within the valid range (0 to `max_k`). If `k` is odd or exceeds `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)`. Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.
     - `max_k` is calculated as `(n^2 - 1) // 2` if `n` is odd, and `n^2 // 2` if `n` is even.
   - **Function 6 (`func_6`)**: This function orchestrates the process. It calls `func_4` to validate `n` and `k`. If `n` is 0 (indicating an invalid `k`), it prints "NO". Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and `func_5` to print the result.
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function generates a permutation with a Manhattan value of `k` (which is divided by 2 at the start). It iterates over the list and uses `func_2` and `func_3` to modify the list until the Manhattan value is achieved.
     - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function swaps two elements in the list to adjust the Manhattan value.
     - **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function swaps two elements in the list to adjust the Manhattan value.

3. **Validation:**
   - The program ensures that `k` is even and within the valid range before attempting to generate a permutation.
   - The functions `func_2` and `func_3` are used to manipulate the permutation to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - The output functions (`func_5` and the print statements in `func_6`) correctly format the output based on the results.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles the constraints and requirements of the problem. It checks for the validity of `k` and generates a suitable permutation if possible. The functions work together to ensure that the output meets the problem's specifications.

**Correctness: True**
