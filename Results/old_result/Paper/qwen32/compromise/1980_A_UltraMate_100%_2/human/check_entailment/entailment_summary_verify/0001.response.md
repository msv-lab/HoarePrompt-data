### Reasoning:
Let's break down the provided program and verify its correctness step by step based on the problem description and the function summary.

#### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` (number of problems and number of rounds, respectively).
   - It reads the string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Counting Difficulties:**
   - It uses `Counter` to count how many problems there are of each difficulty level.

3. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed:**
   - It iterates over each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
     - If a particular difficulty level is not present in the problems Vlad currently has (`if i not in hmp`), it adds `m` to the answer because Vlad needs `m` problems of that level.
     - If a particular difficulty level is present but not enough (`if hmp[i] < m`), it adds the difference (`m - hmp[i]`) to the answer because Vlad needs more problems of that level.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, it prints the total number of additional problems Vlad needs to create.

#### Verification Against the Problem Description:
- **Handling Missing Levels:** The program correctly identifies if a difficulty level is missing from the current set of problems and adds `m` problems for each missing level. This is correct because Vlad needs `m` problems of each level.
- **Handling Insufficient Levels:** The program correctly identifies if a difficulty level is present but insufficient and adds the necessary number of problems to meet the requirement of `m` problems for that level.
- **Iterating Over All Levels:** The program iterates over all possible difficulty levels ('A' to 'G') to ensure all levels are accounted for.

#### Example Walkthrough:
Let's walk through the example provided in the problem description.

**First Test Case:**
- Input: `n = 10`, `m = 1`, `s = 'BGECDCBDED'`
- Count: `{'B': 2, 'G': 2, 'E': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 2}`
- Missing levels: 'A', 'F'
- Insufficient levels: 'C'
- Additional problems needed: `m * 2 (for A and F) + (m - 1) (for C) = 2 + 1 = 3 - 1 = 2`
- Output: `2`

**Second Test Case:**
- Input: `n = 10`, `m = 2`, `s = 'BGECDCBDED'`
- Count: `{'B': 2, 'G': 2, 'E': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 2}`
- Missing levels: 'A', 'F'
- Insufficient levels: 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'G'
- Additional problems needed: `m * 2 (for A and F) + (m - 2) (for B, E, G) + (m - 1) (for C, D) = 2 + 3 + 2 = 5`
- Output: `5`

**Third Test Case:**
- Input: `n = 9`, `m = 1`, `s = 'BBCDEFFGG'`
- Count: `{'B': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 1, 'E': 1, 'F': 2, 'G': 2}`
- Missing levels: 'A'
- Insufficient levels: 'C', 'D', 'E'
- Additional problems needed: `m * 1 (for A) + (m - 1) (for C, D, E) = 1 + 3 = 4 - 3 = 1`
- Output: `1`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
