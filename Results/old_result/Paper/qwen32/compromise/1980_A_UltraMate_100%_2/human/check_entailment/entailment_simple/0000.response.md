### Reasoning:
The program is designed to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure he has at least one problem of each difficulty level ('A' through 'G') for each of the `m` rounds. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, representing the number of problems and the number of rounds, respectively. It also reads a string `s` of length `n` representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Counting Existing Problems**: The program uses `Counter(s)` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed**:
   - It iterates through each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
   - If a difficulty level is not present in the `Counter` (i.e., it's not in `hmp`), it adds `m` to `ans` because Vlad needs `m` problems of that difficulty level.
   - If a difficulty level is present but the count is less than `m`, it adds the difference `m - hmp[i]` to `ans`.

4. **Output**: After processing all difficulty levels for a test case, the program prints the total number of additional problems needed (`ans`).

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the logic with the provided example:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `n = 10`, `m = 1`, `s = 'BGECDCBDED'`
- Count of each difficulty level: `{'B': 3, 'G': 1, 'E': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 2}`
- Missing levels: 'A', 'F'
- Additional problems needed: `1 (for 'A') + 1 (for 'F') = 2`
- Output: `2`

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `n = 10`, `m = 2`, `s = 'BGECDCBDED'`
- Count of each difficulty level: `{'B': 3, 'G': 1, 'E': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 2}`
- Missing levels: 'A', 'F'
- Additional problems needed: `2 (for 'A') + 2 (for 'F') + 1 (for 'G') + 1 (for 'C') + 2 (for 'D') + 2 (for 'E') = 10 - 5 = 5`
- Output: `5`

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `n = 9`, `m = 1`, `s = 'BBCDEFFGG'`
- Count of each difficulty level: `{'B': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 1, 'E': 1, 'F': 2, 'G': 2}`
- Missing levels: 'A'
- Additional problems needed: `1 (for 'A')`
- Output: `1`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
