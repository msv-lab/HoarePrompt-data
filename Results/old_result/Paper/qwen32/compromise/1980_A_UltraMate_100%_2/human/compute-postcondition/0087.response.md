To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the initial state given. In this case, the initial state is simply described as `ans`. This means that `ans` is a variable, but its value is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `ans` from the given information.

Given that we are only told that `ans` exists, the output of the `print(ans)` statement will simply be the value of `ans` as it is currently defined in the program.

Output: **ans (where ans is the value of the variable ans)**
