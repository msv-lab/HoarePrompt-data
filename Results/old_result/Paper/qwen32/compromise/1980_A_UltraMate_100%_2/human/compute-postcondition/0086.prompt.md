Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is `t + 1`, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is the new input string that must contain at least one character, `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`, `hmp` is a Counter object containing the counts of each character in the new `s`, `ans` is `m * (7 - number of characters in 'ABCDEFG' that are in `hmp`)`.
Code of the loop:
for i in hmp:
    if hmp[i] < m:
        ans += m - hmp[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is the new input string that must contain at least one character, `hmp` is a Counter object containing the counts of each character in `s` with at least one character having a count greater than zero. If the current character `i` in `hmp` has a count less than `m`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is the new input string that must contain at least one character, `hmp` is a Counter object containing the counts of each character in `s` with at least one character having a count greater than zero, `i` is the next key in `hmp`. If `hmp[i] < m`, then `ans` is updated to `ans + m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is the new input string that must contain at least one character, `hmp` is a Counter object containing the counts of each character in `s` with at least one character having a count greater than zero, `i` is the next key in the iteration sequence of `hmp` keys. If `hmp[i] < m`, then `ans` is updated to `ans + m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
