Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is a non-empty string from the input, `ans` is `k * m` where `k` is the number of characters in `'ABCDEFG'` not present in `hmp`, `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`, `hmp` is a Counter object containing the counts of each character in `s`. The current value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`**
