The code snippet provided assigns the string `'ABCDEFG'` to the variable `p`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is the string from the input, `ans` is 0, `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`.**
