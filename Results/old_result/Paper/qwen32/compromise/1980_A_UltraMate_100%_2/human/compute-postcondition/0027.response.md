Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is a non-empty string from the input, `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`, `hmp` is a Counter object containing the counts of each character in `s`, `i` is the next key in `hmp`. If `hmp[i] < m`, `ans` is updated by adding `m - hmp[i]` to its previous value. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
