`The code snippet reads an integer value from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. After executing the code, `t` will hold the value of the integer read from the input. The values of `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the integer value read from the input, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.`

Output State: **`t` is the integer value read from the input, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.**
