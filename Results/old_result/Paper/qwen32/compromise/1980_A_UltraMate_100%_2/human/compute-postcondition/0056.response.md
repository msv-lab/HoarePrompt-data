Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1` and still greater than 0; `n` is the first integer from the new input; `m` is the second integer from the new input; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'; `s` is the new input string that must contain at least one character; `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`; `hmp` is a Counter object containing the counts of each character in the new `s`; `i` is the next key in `hmp` that hasn't been iterated over yet. If `hmp[i] < m`, then `ans` is updated to its previous value plus `m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
