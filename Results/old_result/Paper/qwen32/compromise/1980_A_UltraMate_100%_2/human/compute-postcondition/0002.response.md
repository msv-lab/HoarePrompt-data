The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` will read a line of input, split it into two parts, convert each part to an integer, and assign them to the variables `n` and `m` respectively. This means the values of `n` and `m` will change based on the input provided. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 and `m` is an integer between 1 and 5. After executing the code, these values will be updated to whatever integers are provided in the input.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'**.
