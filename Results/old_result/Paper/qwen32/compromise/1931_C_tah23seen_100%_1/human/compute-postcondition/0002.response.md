The code assigns the value of `len(arr) - 1` to the variable `j`. Given that `arr` is a list of integers and `n` is the length of the list `arr`, the value of `j` will be `n - 1`.

Other variables (`arr`, `n`, `i`, `t`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`. The function is called once for each test case, and the number of test cases `t` satisfies 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `i` is 0. `n` is the length of `arr`. `j` is `n - 1`.**
