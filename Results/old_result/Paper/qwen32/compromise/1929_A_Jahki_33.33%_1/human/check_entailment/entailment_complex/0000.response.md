### Reasoning:

The goal of the problem is to determine the maximum beauty of the array, which is calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array. The provided program sorts the array and then calculates the beauty based on the sorted order, which is the correct approach to achieve the maximum beauty. 

However, there is a logical flaw in the provided program. Specifically, the function `func_1` is used to check if the array is strictly increasing, and if it is, the program incorrectly prints `0` as the beauty of the array, which is not always correct. If the array is strictly increasing, the beauty is calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, not `0`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the issues and correct approach:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The program correctly sorts the array to maximize the beauty, as the maximum beauty is achieved when the array is sorted in ascending order.
2. **Calculating Beauty**: After sorting, the program calculates the beauty by summing up the differences between consecutive elements, which is the correct approach.
3. **Function `func_1` Misuse**: The function `func_1` checks if the array is strictly increasing, but the program incorrectly uses this result to print `0` as the beauty when the array is strictly increasing. This is incorrect because even if the array is strictly increasing, the beauty should still be calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

### Correctness:

Given the identified issue with the function `func_1` misuse, the program is not correct as it stands. The correct approach should be to always calculate the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, regardless of whether the array is strictly increasing or not.

### Correctness: **False**

The program should be corrected to remove the condition that checks if the array is strictly increasing and always calculate the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
