### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a logical error in the function `func_1` and its impact on the program's behavior. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is strictly increasing (i.e., `a[i - 1] < a[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n - 1`). If the array is strictly increasing, it returns `True`.
   - The program then prints `0` for the beauty of the array if `func_1` returns `True`. However, this is incorrect because the beauty of the array can still be non-zero even if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3]`, the beauty is `2`, not `0`.
   - Therefore, the function `func_1` is unnecessary and incorrect for the problem's requirements.

2. **Handling Input**:
   - The code reads input for each test case, and the list comprehension `[int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]` is unnecessary because the problem guarantees that the input will only contain valid integers. The condition `if i.isdigit()` can lead to incorrect behavior if the input is not properly formatted, but given the problem constraints, this is not a significant issue.

3. **Sorting and Calculating Beauty**:
   - The code correctly sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements. This part of the code is correct and should always be executed regardless of the initial order of the array.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment accurately points out the logical error in the function `func_1` and suggests that it should be removed. The corrected version of the program, which always sorts the array and calculates the beauty, is the correct approach. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
