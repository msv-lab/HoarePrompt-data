The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of a string `s` of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10. For each string, it checks if the string is of length 1 or if all characters in the string are the same. If either condition is true, it outputs "No". Otherwise, it outputs "Yes" followed by a modified version of the string `s`. The modification involves shuffling the string; if the shuffled string is the same as the original, it rotates the string by moving the first character to the end.
