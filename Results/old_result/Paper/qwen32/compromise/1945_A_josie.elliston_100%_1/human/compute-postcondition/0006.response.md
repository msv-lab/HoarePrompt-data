Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`, which are non-negative integers. If a specific condition is met (not detailed in the output description), the function returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3.**
