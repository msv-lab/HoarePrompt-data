The code snippet reads a string input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `a`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace.**
