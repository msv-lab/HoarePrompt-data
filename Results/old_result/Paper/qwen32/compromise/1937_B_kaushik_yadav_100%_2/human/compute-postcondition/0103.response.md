Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is the input string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is the initial `ans` concatenated with `a[i]` and then `b[i]`; `i` is `len(a) - 2` if `i + 1` is not less than `len(a)` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `i` is 1 and `len(a)` must be greater than 1; `work` is False; `j` is `len(a) - 1`; `counter` is the final count based on the conditions in the loop; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
