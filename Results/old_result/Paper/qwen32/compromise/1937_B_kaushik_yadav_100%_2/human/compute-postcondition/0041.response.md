Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is a string that is being built based on the conditions described and now includes the character `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `i` must be less than `len(a)`; `work` is a boolean flag that determines how `ans` is updated and whether `i` is incremented; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `i`, and `work` remain unchanged. However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
