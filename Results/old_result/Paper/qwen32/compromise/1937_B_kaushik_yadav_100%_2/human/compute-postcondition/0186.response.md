The code snippet `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `b` to the string `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the new input string with no leading or trailing whitespace and `a` is not an empty string; `b` is the updated input string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `work` is False; `j` is len(a) - 1; `counter` reflects the number of consecutive matches of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]` until the loop breaks or completes; `i` is such that `i < len(a) - 1; `ans` is updated to include `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**
