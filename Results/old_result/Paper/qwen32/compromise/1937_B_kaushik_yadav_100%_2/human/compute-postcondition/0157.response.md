Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the new input string with no leading or trailing whitespace and `a` is not an empty string; `b` is the updated input string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a`; `i` is 0; `work` is True; `j` is len(a) - 1; `counter` reflects the number of consecutive matches of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]` until the loop breaks or completes.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive; `n` remains the input integer; `a` remains the input string without leading or trailing spaces and is not empty; `b` remains the updated input string without leading or trailing spaces; `ans` now contains the first character of `a`; `i` remains 0; `work` is still True; `j` remains the length of `a` minus one; and `counter` still reflects the number of consecutive matches of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]`.
