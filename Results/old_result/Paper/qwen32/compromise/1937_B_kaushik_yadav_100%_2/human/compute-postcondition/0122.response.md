To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand how the variable `ans` is constructed. However, the provided initial state does not include the loop or the logic that constructs the string `ans`. Therefore, based on the given information, we can only describe `ans` in terms of the process described.

Here's the breakdown of the provided information:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` and `b` are non-empty strings with no leading or trailing whitespace.
- `ans` is a string constructed by alternating between characters from `a` and `b`.
- `i` is equal to `len(a)`.
- `work` is a boolean initialized to False.
- `j` is `len(a) - 1`.
- `counter` is the final count based on the conditions in the loop.

Since the exact loop and construction logic for `ans` are not provided, we can describe `ans` as a string that is formed by alternating characters from strings `a` and `b`. The exact characters and the final form of `ans` depend on the lengths of `a` and `b` and the logic within the loop.

Output: **ans (where ans is a string constructed by alternating characters from strings a and b based on the loop conditions)**
