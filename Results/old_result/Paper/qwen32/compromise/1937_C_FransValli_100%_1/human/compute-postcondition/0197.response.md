Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It interacts with the environment to query up to 3n times to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in a secret permutation of length n. Based on these queries, it returns a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices in the permutation is maximized.**
