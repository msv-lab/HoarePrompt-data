The code snippet provided is `res = input()`. This line of code takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `res`. The initial state of `res` is an input string, which means the value of `res` is about to be overwritten by the user's input. All other variables (`maxi`, `arr`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`maxi` is the highest value of `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists; `arr` is `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`, `[0, i]` if `res` is `'='`, and `[0]` otherwise; `n` is 2; `res` is the user's input string.**
