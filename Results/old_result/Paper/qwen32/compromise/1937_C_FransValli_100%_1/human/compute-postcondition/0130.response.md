The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that is not used within the loop body. Since the loop is controlled by the range of the integer input, the only state we need to adjust is the integer input itself to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

Given that the loop runs for `int(input())` iterations, we need to ensure that the input integer is decremented by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

State: **maxi is 5, arr is [3, 7, 9], mini is 9, input must be decremented by 1 to allow for one more iteration**.

However, since we are only adjusting the state and not the actual input, we can represent the state as follows:

State: **maxi is 5, arr is [3, 7, 9], mini is 9**.

The input state is implicitly understood to have been decremented for the next iteration.
