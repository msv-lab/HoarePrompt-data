Output State: **The number of test cases (int(input())) is at least 1; `n` is greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0; `arr` is `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`, `[0, i]` if `res` is `'='`, otherwise `arr` remains `[0]`; `res` is the value of the input string; `i` is `maxi + 1`. `res` is updated to the new input string.**

In simpler terms: The output state remains the same except that `res` is now the new input string. All other variables (`n`, `maxi`, `arr`, and `i`) retain their previous values.
