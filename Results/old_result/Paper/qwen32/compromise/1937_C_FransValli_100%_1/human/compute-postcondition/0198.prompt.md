You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a secret permutation p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. For each test case, the function can interactively query up to 3n times to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the permutation, and must then output a pair of indices i and j such that the bitwise XOR of p_i and p_j is maximized. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        maxi = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                maxi = i
        
        arr = [0]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                arr = [i]
            elif res == '=':
                arr.append(i)
        
        mini = arr[0]
        
        for item in arr[1:]:
            print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '>':
                mini = item
        
        print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)
        
    #State: maxi, mini for the last test case processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It interacts with the environment to query up to 3n times to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in a secret permutation of length n. Based on these queries, it returns a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices in the permutation is maximized.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
