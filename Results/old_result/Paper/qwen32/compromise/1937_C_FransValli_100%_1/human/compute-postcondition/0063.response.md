Output State: **The number of test cases (int(input())) is at least 1; `n` is greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0; `arr` contains all `i` values (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'='` and the most recent `i` for which `res` was `'<'`; `mini` is the smallest value in `arr` that is greater than all other elements in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `mini` will be the smallest value in `arr` that is greater than all other elements in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`. The values of `n`, `maxi`, and `arr` remain as per the initial conditions and updates during the loop, while `mini` is finalized based on the comparisons made within the loop.
