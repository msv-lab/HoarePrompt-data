The code snippet `res = input()` assigns the value of user's input to the variable `res`. The other variables (`maxi`, `mini`, `n`, `i`, and `arr`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the new value of `res` as the user's input, while the other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`maxi` is `n-1`, `mini` is 9, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the user's input, and `arr` is unchanged.**
