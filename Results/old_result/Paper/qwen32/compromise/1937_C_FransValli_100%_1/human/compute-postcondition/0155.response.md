The code snippet `arr = [i]` assigns the list `[i]` to the variable `arr`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of the list. Therefore, we can only state that `arr` is now a list containing whatever value `i` holds.

Given the initial state, the other variables (`maxi`, `mini`, `n`, and `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`maxi` is `n-1`, `arr` is `[i]`, `mini` is 9, `n` must be greater than 1, `res` is '<'**.
