The value of `maxi` is updated to the value of `i`, which is 2. The initial condition for `maxi` being 7 if `res` is '<' or 0 otherwise does not affect the current assignment. The other variables (`arr`, `mini`, `n`, `i`, and `res`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`maxi` is 2, `arr` is [3, 7, 9], `mini` is 9, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `res` is an input string.**
