Postcondition: **The number of test cases (int(input())) must be at least 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0; `arr` is `[0]`; `res` is the value of the input string, and `res` is not `'<'`**
