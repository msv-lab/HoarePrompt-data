The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `maxi + 1`, and `n` is greater than 1.

To adjust the state for the start of the next iteration:
- Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, we need to set `i` to its next value, which is `maxi + 2` (since `i` was `maxi + 1` at the end of the last iteration).
- `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **The number of test cases (int(input())) is at least 1; `n` is greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0; `arr` is `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`, `[i, i]` if `res` is `'<'` and the previous `arr` was `[i]`, `[0, i, i]` if `res` is `'<'` and the previous `arr` was `[0, i]`, `[0, i]` if `res` is `'='`, and unchanged if `res` is neither `'<'` nor `'='`. `res` is the value of the new input string; `i` is `maxi + 2`.**
