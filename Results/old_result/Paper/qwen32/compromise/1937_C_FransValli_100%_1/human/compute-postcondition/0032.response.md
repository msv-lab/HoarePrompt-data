Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0.
   - `arr` is `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`, `[0, i]` if `res` is `'='`, otherwise `arr` remains `[0]`.
   - `res` is the value of the input string.
   - `i` is `maxi + 1`.

2. **Print statement analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)`.
   - We need to determine the values of `maxi`, `arr[0]`, and `i` to know what will be printed.

3. **Determining the values:**
   - `maxi` is the largest index `i` from 1 to `n-1` where `res` was `'<'`. If no such `i` exists, `maxi` is 0.
   - `arr[0]` is the first element of the array `arr`. Based on the state description:
     - If `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is `[i]`, so `arr[0]` is `i`.
     - If `res` is `'='`, `arr` is `[0, i]`, so `arr[0]` is `0`.
     - If `res` is neither `'<'` nor `'='`, `arr` is `[0]`, so `arr[0]` is `0`.
   - `i` is `maxi + 1`.

4. **Possible scenarios:**
   - If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0. In this case:
     - If `res` is `'='`, `arr` is `[0, i]`, so `arr[0]` is `0`.
     - If `res` is neither `'<'` nor `'='`, `arr` is `[0]`, so `arr[0]` is `0`.
     - `i` is `maxi + 1`, which is `0 + 1 = 1`.
     - The print statement becomes `print('?', 0, 0, 0, 1, flush=True)`.
   - If `res` was `'<'` at some point, `maxi` is the largest such `i`. In this case:
     - If `res` is `'<'` at `maxi`, `arr` is `[maxi]`, so `arr[0]` is `maxi`.
     - If `res` is `'='` at `maxi`, `arr` is `[0, maxi]`, so `arr[0]` is `0`.
     - If `res` is neither `'<'` nor `'='` at `maxi`, `arr` is `[0]`, so `arr[0]` is `0`.
     - `i` is `maxi + 1`.
     - The print statement becomes `print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, maxi + 1, flush=True)`.

Since the exact value of `res` and the sequence of `res` values are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values of `maxi` and `arr[0]`. However, we can describe the output based on the possible scenarios.

**Output Description:**
- If `res` was never `'<'`, the output will be `?, 0, 0, 0, 1`.
- If `res` was `'<'` at some point, the output will be `?, maxi, arr[0], maxi, maxi + 1`, where `maxi` is the largest index `i` from 1 to `n-1` where `res` was `'<'`, and `arr[0]` is `maxi` if `res` is `'<'` at `maxi`, or `0` otherwise.

Given the lack of specific `res` values, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **?, maxi, arr[0], maxi, i (where maxi is the largest index i from 1 to n-1 where res was '<', arr[0] is maxi if res is '<' at maxi, or 0 otherwise, and i is maxi + 1)**
