The code snippet `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `arr` is initially `[0]`. After the code execution, `arr` will be `[0, i]`.

The other variables (`maxi`, `mini`, `n`, `res`) are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`maxi` is `n-1`, `arr` is `[0, i]`, `mini` is 9, `n` is greater than 1, `res` is '='**

In natural language, this means that the list `arr` now contains two elements: `0` and `i`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
