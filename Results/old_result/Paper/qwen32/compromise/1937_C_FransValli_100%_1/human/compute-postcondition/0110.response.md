To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given information.

The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. For each iteration, it prints a query and checks the response:
- If the response is `'<'`, it updates `arr` to `[i]` and potentially updates `maxi`.
- If the response is `'='`, it appends `i` to `arr`.

Given the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer the following:
- After the first iteration (`i = 1`), `arr` could be `[1]` if the response was `'<'`, `[0, 1]` if the response was `'='`, or `[0]` otherwise.
- After the second iteration (`i = 2`), `arr` could be `[2]` if the response was `'<'`, `[0, 2]` if the response was `'='`, or `[0, 1]` otherwise.
- After the third iteration (`i = 3`), `arr` could be `[3]` if the response was `'<'`, `[0, 3]` or `[0, 1, 3]` if the response was `'='`, or `[0, 2]` otherwise.

From this pattern, we can generalize that after all iterations up to `i = n-1`:
- `maxi` will be the highest value of `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists.
- `arr` will contain all values of `i` for which the response was `'='`, with the highest value of `i` for which the response was `'<'` (if any) as the only element if no `'='` responses were given.

Therefore, after all iterations are complete:
- `maxi` will be the highest value of `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists.
- `arr` will contain all values of `i` for which the response was `'='`, with the highest value of `i` for which the response was `'<'` (if any) as the only element if no `'='` responses were given.

Output State: **`maxi` is the highest value of `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists; `arr` contains all values of `i` for which the response was `'='`, or the highest value of `i` for which the response was `'<'` if no `'='` responses were given.**
