The code snippet `mini = item` assigns the value of `item` to `mini`. However, `item` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `mini` after this operation. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`maxi` is 5, `arr` is [3, 7, 9], `mini` is `item`, `res` is '>'.**
