The code assigns the value of `arr[0]` to `mini`. Given that `arr` can be either `[0]` or `[n-1]`, the value of `mini` will be either `0` or `n-1`.

Output State: **`maxi` is `n-1`, `mini` is either `0` or `n-1`, `n` is the same as the input integer, `arr` is `[0]` or `[n-1]` depending on the last response.**
