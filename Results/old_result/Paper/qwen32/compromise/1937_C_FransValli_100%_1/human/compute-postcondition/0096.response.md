The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 2. The `for` loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1`. Since `n` is 2, the range is from 1 to 1, meaning the loop will only run once with `i` being 1. After this iteration, `i` will be 2, which is not less than `n`, so the loop will terminate.

Since the loop will not execute again, there is no need to adjust the state for another iteration. However, if we were to consider the state right before the loop terminates (which is the state at the start of the final, non-executing iteration), `i` would be 2.

Given the task constraints, we can state the final state as follows:

State: **`maxi` is the highest value of `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists; `arr` is `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`, `[0, i]` if `res` is `'='`, and `[0]` otherwise; `n` is 2; `res` is an input string; `i` is 2**.

However, since the loop does not execute again with this `i` value, the state provided is effectively the final state after the loop terminates. If we strictly adhere to the requirement of showing the state at the start of the next iteration (which does not exist), we can simply restate the given state without modification:

State: **`maxi` is the highest value of `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists; `arr` is `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`, `[0, i]` if `res` is `'='`, and `[0]` otherwise; `n` is 2; `res` is an input string**.
