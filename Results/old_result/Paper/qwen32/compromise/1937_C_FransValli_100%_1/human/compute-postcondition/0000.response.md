In the provided task, the for loop iterates over the number of test cases, which is determined by the input `int(input())`. The loop head only contains the loop variable `_`, which is a common convention for a loop variable when its value is not used within the loop body. Therefore, the only state that can be adjusted is the number of test cases, which is `int(input())`.

To ensure the loop executes, the number of test cases must be at least 1. Given that the problem states there are multiple test cases, we can assume there is at least one test case to process.

State: **The number of test cases (int(input())) must be at least 1**.
