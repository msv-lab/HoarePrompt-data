Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `maxi` is defined as `n-1`.
   - `arr` is a list containing a single element, which is `0`.
   - `mini` is `9`.
   - `n` must be greater than `1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The first value to be printed is a literal string `'?'`.
   - The second value is `maxi`. Since `maxi` is defined as `n-1`, and `n` must be greater than `1`, `maxi` will be at least `0`. However, the exact value of `n` is not provided, so we can only say that `maxi` is `n-1`.
   - The third value is `arr[0]`. Since `arr` is `[0]`, `arr[0]` is `0`.
   - The fourth value is `maxi` again, so it will also be `n-1`.
   - The fifth value is `i`. However, `i` is not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown based on the given information.

Given the unknown value of `i`, we can only precisely describe the known values and indicate that `i` is undefined.

**Conclusion:**
Output: **? [n-1] 0 [n-1] i (where n is greater than 1 and i is undefined)**
