To determine the output, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
1. The number of test cases must be at least 1.
2. `n` must be greater than 1.
3. `res` is an input string.
4. If `res` equals '<', then `maxi` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `maxi` remains unchanged.
5. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is structured to output a question mark followed by the values of `maxi`, `maxi`, `i`, and `i`.
- The value of `maxi` depends on the value of `res`. If `res` equals '<', `maxi` is set to the current value of `i`. Otherwise, `maxi` retains its previous value.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value before the print statement is executed.

### Output Details:
- The first `maxi` and the second `maxi` in the print statement will be the same.
- The first `i` and the second `i` in the print statement will also be the same.
- The exact value of `maxi` and `i` depends on the iteration and the value of `res` in that particular iteration.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:
- A question mark ('?')
- Followed by the current value of `maxi` (which could be the previous value or the current value of `i` if `res` was '<')
- Followed by the current value of `maxi` again
- Followed by the current value of `i`
- Followed by the current value of `i` again

Since we don't have the exact values of `maxi` and `i` from the initial state (as they are dependent on the input and iteration), we describe them in terms of their possible values based on the conditions.

Output: **? maxi maxi i i (where maxi is the value of maxi which could be the previous value or the current value of i if res was '<', and i is the current value of i)**
