The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than 3.

State: **`maxi` is 2 if `res` is '<', otherwise `maxi` remains 0, `arr` is [3, 7, 9], `mini` is 9, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, and `res` is an input string.**
