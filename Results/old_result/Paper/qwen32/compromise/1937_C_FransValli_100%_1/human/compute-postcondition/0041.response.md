Output State: **The number of test cases (int(input())) is at least 1; `n` is greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0; `arr` is now `[i]`; `res` is the value of the new input string; `i` is `maxi + 2`.**

In simple terms, `arr` has been updated to `[i]`. The values of `n`, `maxi`, `res`, and `i` remain as per their previous definitions and values, except for `arr` which is now a list containing only the value of `i`.
