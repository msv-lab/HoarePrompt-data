Postcondition: **`t` is a specific integer between 1 and 500; `s` is a string with a length greater than 1; `count` is 3 if `s[j] != s[j + 1]`, otherwise `count` is 2; `flag` is True if `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'`, otherwise `flag` remains False; `j` is less than `len(s) - 2`; if `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'`, then `flag` is True, `j` is incremented by 1, the character at index `j` of `s` is '1', and the character at index `j + 1` of `s` is the character at index 2 of `s`. Otherwise, `flag` remains False and `j` is not incremented.**
