Postcondition: **`t` is a specific integer between 1 and 500; `s` is a string with length greater than 1; `count` is 2; `flag` is True if the character at index `j` of `s` is '0' and the character at index `j + 1` of `s` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False; `j` is 1 if `flag` is True, otherwise `j` remains 0; `i` is `len(s)`. The character at index `j` of `s` is '1' if `flag` is True, otherwise it retains its original value. The character at index `j + 1` of `s` is unknown if `flag` is True, otherwise it retains its original value.**
