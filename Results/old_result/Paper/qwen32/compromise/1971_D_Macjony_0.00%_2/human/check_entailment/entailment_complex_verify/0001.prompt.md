You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':

    #State: The loop has processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it has printed the number of transitions between different characters in the string `s` minus 1 if there is at least one "01" substring.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and prints the number of transitions between different characters in the string, subtracting one if there is at least one occurrence of the substring "01".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to find the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) that a binary string can be cut into, such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

### Key Observations
1. If the string is already sorted, only one piece is needed.
2. If there is a transition from '0' to '1', it indicates a potential point where the string needs to be cut.
3. However, if the string starts with '0's and ends with '1's, the last transition from '0' to '1' does not require an additional piece because the remaining '1's can be part of the same piece.

### Program Analysis
The program follows this logic:
- It initializes `count` to 1, assuming at least one piece is needed.
- It iterates through the string and increments `count` whenever it encounters a transition from '0' to '1'.
- If a transition from '0' to '1' is found, it sets `flag` to `True`.
- After the loop, if `flag` is `True`, it decrements `count` by 1 to account for the last transition which doesn't require an extra piece.

### Example Walkthrough
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Input:** `11010`
   - Transitions: `1->0`, `0->1`, `1->0`
   - `count` becomes 4 initially.
   - Since there is a '0->1' transition, `flag` is set to `True`.
   - Final `count` after decrementing is 3, which matches the expected output.

2. **Input:** `00000000`
   - No transitions.
   - `count` remains 1, which matches the expected output.

3. **Input:** `1`
   - No transitions.
   - `count` remains 1, which matches the expected output.

4. **Input:** `10`
   - Transition: `1->0`
   - `count` becomes 2, which matches the expected output.

5. **Input:** `0001111`
   - Transition: `0->1`
   - `count` becomes 2 initially.
   - Since there is a '0->1' transition, `flag` is set to `True`.
   - Final `count` after decrementing is 1, which matches the expected output.

6. **Input:** `0110`
   - Transitions: `0->1`, `1->0`
   - `count` becomes 3 initially.
   - Since there is a '0->1' transition, `flag` is set to `True`.
   - Final `count` after decrementing is 2, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of pieces required to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string. All test cases match the expected outputs.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
