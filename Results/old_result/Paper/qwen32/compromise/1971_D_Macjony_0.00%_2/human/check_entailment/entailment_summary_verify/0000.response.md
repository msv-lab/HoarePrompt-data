To evaluate the correctness of the given program, let's systematically analyze the logic and compare it with the problem requirements and the provided function summary.

### Problem Recap:
We need to determine the minimum number of contiguous pieces a binary string can be cut into, such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all `0`s followed by all `1`s).

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)
```

### Logic Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: For each test case, initialize `count` to 1 because at least one piece is always required.
2. **Loop through the string**: Traverse the string to find transitions from `0` to `1` and `1` to `0`.
3. **Count Transitions**: Each time a transition occurs (`s[j] != s[j + 1]`), increment the `count` by 1.
4. **Special Case Handling**: If a transition from `0` to `1` is found (`flag` is set to `True`), decrement the `count` by 1. This seems to be an attempt to handle the scenario where a single cut might suffice if the string starts with `0`s and ends with `1`s.
5. **Output**: Print the final `count` for each test case.

### Function Summary:
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and prints the number of transitions between different characters in the string, subtracting one if there is at least one occurrence of the substring "01".

### Evaluation:
Let's break down the logic and see if it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Counting Transitions**:
   - The program correctly counts the number of transitions between `0` and `1` and vice versa. This is crucial because each transition indicates a potential cut point.
   
2. **Adjusting Count Based on "01" Transition**:
   - The program checks for the presence of a "01" transition and decrements the count by 1 if found. This adjustment is intended to account for the fact that if the string can be split into pieces such that the last piece of `0`s can be moved to the front, then one less cut is needed.
   - However, this logic is flawed. The presence of a "01" transition does not necessarily mean that one less cut is needed. For example, in the string "1010", there is a "01" transition, but the minimum cuts required are 3, not 2.

### Counterexample:
Consider the string `s = "1010"`:
- Transitions: `1 -> 0` (count = 2), `0 -> 1` (count = 3)
- Presence of "01": `flag` is set to `True`
- Adjusted count: `count = 3 - 1 = 2`
- Expected output: `3` (since it needs to be split into "1", "0", "1", "0")
- Actual output: `2` (incorrect)

### Conclusion:
The logic of decrementing the count when a "01" transition is found is incorrect and leads to wrong results in some cases. Therefore, the program is not always producing the correct output.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
