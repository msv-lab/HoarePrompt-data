### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Precomputation:**
   - The program initializes an array `values` of size `2 * 10^5 + 1` to store the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to each index.
   - It then iterates through each number from 1 to `2 * 10^5`, calculates the sum of its digits, and updates the cumulative sum in the `values` array.

2. **Digit Sum Calculation:**
   - For each number `i`, the program converts it to a string to iterate over each digit.
   - It sums the digits and adds this sum to the cumulative sum stored in `values[i - 1]` to get `values[i]`.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value `n` and prints the cumulative sum of digit sums up to `n` from the precomputed `values` array.

4. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - Precomputing the cumulative sums up to `2 * 10^5` ensures that each test case can be answered in constant time, which is crucial given the constraints (up to 10,000 test cases, each with `n` up to `2 * 10^5`).
   - The time complexity for precomputation is O(m * d), where `m` is the maximum value of `n` (2 * 10^5) and `d` is the number of digits in the largest number (6 for `2 * 10^5`), resulting in O(1.2 * 10^6) operations, which is well within the 0.5-second time limit.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly precomputes the cumulative sums of digit sums and efficiently answers each test case by looking up the precomputed values. There are no logical errors in the implementation, and it adheres to the problem constraints.

**Correctness: True**
