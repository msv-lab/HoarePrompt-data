Reasoning:  
The given program calculates the sum of the digits of each integer from 1 to `n` for each test case and then prints the cumulative sum of these digit sums. The program uses a precomputed list `values` where `values[i]` stores the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`. This approach is efficient because it avoids recalculating the digit sums for numbers that have already been processed in previous test cases.

The program initializes the list `values` with a size of `2 * 10^5 + 1` to handle the maximum possible value of `n` (which is `2 * 10^5`). It then iterates from 1 to `2 * 10^5`, calculating the sum of the digits for each number `i` and updating `values[i]` to be the sum of `values[i-1]` and the digit sum of `i`.

For each test case, the program simply reads the value of `n` and prints `values[n]`, which is the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `n`.

The execution summary indicates that the function processes each test case by looking up the precomputed cumulative sum, which is efficient and correct given the constraints.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
