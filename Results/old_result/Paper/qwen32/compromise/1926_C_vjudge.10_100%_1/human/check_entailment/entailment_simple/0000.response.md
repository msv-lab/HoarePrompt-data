### Reasoning:
The provided program aims to solve the problem of calculating the sum of the sums of digits of integers from 1 to `n` for multiple test cases. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program to verify its correctness:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a list `values` of size `inf` (which is set to 200001) to store cumulative sums of the digit sums from 1 to `i` for each `i` from 1 to 200000.
   - `t` is read from the input, representing the number of test cases.

2. **Precomputation**:
   - The program runs a loop from `i = 1` to `i = 200000`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates the sum of the digits of `i` and adds this to the cumulative sum stored in `values[i-1]`, storing the result in `values[i]`.
   - This precomputation ensures that for any `n` up to 200000, the sum of the sums of digits from 1 to `n` can be retrieved in constant time.

3. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - For each of the `t` test cases, the program reads the value of `n` and prints `values[n]`, which is the precomputed sum of the sums of digits from 1 to `n`.

### Verification Against the Problem Description:
- **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the values of `n` for each test case.
- **Precomputation**: The precomputation step ensures that the program can handle the maximum possible value of `n` (which is 200000) efficiently.
- **Output**: The program outputs the correct result for each test case by using the precomputed values.

### Conclusion:
The program is designed to handle up to 10^4 test cases, each with `n` up to 2 * 10^5, within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case. The precomputation step ensures that each test case is processed in constant time, making the overall time complexity manageable.

**Correctness: True**
