To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop iterates over each digit of the integer `i` (which is initially `t + 2`). For each digit `x` in the string representation of `i`, it adds the integer value of `x` to `sum_value_digits`. The loop will execute as many times as there are digits in the number `i`.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000.
   - `inf` is a constant value of 200,001.
   - `values` is a list of 200,001 elements where `values[i]` is initially `sum_value_digits` (which is 0), and all other elements are 0.
   - `i` is initialized to `t + 2`.
   - `sum_value_digits` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each digit of the integer `i`.
   - For each digit `x` in the string representation of `i`, it adds `int(x)` to `sum_value_digits`.

3. **Final Output State:**
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `inf` remains unchanged at 200,001.
   - `values` will have `values[i]` updated to the sum of the digits of `i`, and all other elements will remain 0.
   - `i` remains `t + 2`.
   - `sum_value_digits` will be the sum of the digits of `i`.

Let's calculate `sum_value_digits` for the final state. Suppose `i` is `t + 2`. The number of digits in `i` will determine how many times the loop executes.

For example, if `t = 1`, then `i = 3`, and the sum of the digits of `3` is `3`.
If `t = 9998`, then `i = 10000`, and the sum of the digits of `10000` is `1`.

In general, the final value of `sum_value_digits` will be the sum of the digits of `i`, where `i = t + 2`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 elements where `values[t + 2]` is the sum of the digits of `t + 2` and all other elements are 0, `i` is `t + 2`, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the digits of `t + 2`.**

In natural language, after the loop finishes executing, `sum_value_digits` will hold the sum of the digits of the number `t + 2`. The `values` list will have this sum stored at the index `t + 2`, and all other elements in `values` will remain 0. The variables `t`, `inf`, and `i` will remain unchanged from their initial values.
