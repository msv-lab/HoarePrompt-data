To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to analyze the provided loop and the initial state. 

The loop iterates over the digits of the integer `i`, converts each digit to an integer, and adds it to `sum_value_digits`. The variable `i` is not modified within the loop, so it seems that the loop's iterations are not changing `i` directly. However, the description of the output states after the first few iterations suggests that `i` is being incremented outside the loop snippet provided, which is not shown here.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first three iterations, it seems that `i` is incremented by 1 after each loop execution. Therefore, the loop will run `t` times, with `i` taking on values from 1 to `t`.

Let's calculate the final value of `sum_value_digits` after `t` iterations. `sum_value_digits` accumulates the sum of the digits of `i` for each iteration from 1 to `t`.

To calculate this sum, we need to sum the digits of all integers from 1 to `t`. Here's how we can do it in Python:

1. Initialize `sum_value_digits` to 0.
2. For each integer `i` from 1 to `t`, convert `i` to a string, iterate over each character in the string, convert it back to an integer, and add it to `sum_value_digits`.

Since the loop runs `t` times, and `i` increments by 1 each time, we can compute the final value of `sum_value_digits` by summing the digits of all numbers from 1 to `t`.

Let's compute this in Python:

```python
def sum_of_digits(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

def final_sum_value_digits(t):
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, t + 1):
        total_sum += sum_of_digits(i)
    return total_sum

# Given t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
t = 10000  # Example value for t
final_sum = final_sum_value_digits(t)

print(final_sum)
```
```output
180001
```
Given the output of the Python code, the final value of `sum_value_digits` after the loop has executed all `t` iterations is `180001` when `t` is `10000`. However, since `t` can be any integer from 1 to 10,000, we need to express the final output state in a general form.

The final output state after the loop has executed all `t` iterations is:

- `t` remains the same integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4).
- `inf` remains 200001.
- `values` remains a list of 200001 elements, all initialized to 0.
- `i` is `t + 1` (since `i` increments by 1 after each loop execution).
- `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `t`.

Therefore, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 elements, all initialized to 0, `i` is `t + 1`, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `t`.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations, `t` remains the same, `inf` remains 200001, `values` remains a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is one more than the initial value of `t`, and `sum_value_digits` is the total sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `t`.
