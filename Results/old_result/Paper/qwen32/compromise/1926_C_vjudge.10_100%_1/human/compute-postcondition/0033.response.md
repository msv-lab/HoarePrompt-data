To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the `values` list.

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = inf - 1` (which is 200,000 in this case). For each iteration, it calculates the sum of the digits of `i`, and then it updates the `values` list such that `values[i]` is the sum of `values[i - 1]` and the sum of the digits of `i`.

The loop will run 200,000 times, and after each iteration, the `values` list will be updated accordingly. The final state of the `values` list will be such that `values[i]` contains the cumulative sum of the digit sums from `1` to `i`.

Let's break down the final output state:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop.
- `inf` remains 200,001 as it is a constant.
- `i` will be equal to `inf` (200,001) after the loop completes all iterations.
- `values` will be a list of 200,001 elements where each `values[i]` (for `1 ≤ i ≤ 200,000`) is the cumulative sum of the digit sums from `1` to `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 elements where `values[i]` is the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i` for 1 ≤ `i` ≤ 200000, `i` is 200001.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `t` and `inf` remain the same, `i` reaches 200,001, and `values[i]` for each `i` from 1 to 200,000 is the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`.
