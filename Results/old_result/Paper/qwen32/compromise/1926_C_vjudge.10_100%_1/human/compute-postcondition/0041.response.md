Output State: **`t` is 1, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 elements where `values[i]` is the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i` for 1 ≤ `i` ≤ 200000, `i` is 200001, `value` is the new input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `value` is updated to the new input integer. All other variables retain their initial values.
