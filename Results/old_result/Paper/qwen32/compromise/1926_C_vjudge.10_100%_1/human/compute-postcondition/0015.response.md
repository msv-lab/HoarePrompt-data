To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over `str(i)`. Therefore, the state of `i` is the only one we can adjust to ensure the loop can execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Head Analysis**: The loop iterates over `str(i)`. This means the loop will execute if `str(i)` is a non-empty string.
2. **Current State of `i`**: The current state before the loop is `i = t + 2`. Given that `t` is an integer with `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, the smallest possible value for `i` is `1 + 2 = 3`, and the largest possible value for `i` is `10^4 + 2 = 10002`. In both cases, `str(i)` will be a non-empty string.
3. **Adjustments Needed**: Since `i = t + 2` will always result in a non-empty string for the given range of `t`, no adjustment to `i` is necessary to ensure the loop executes.

Thus, the state remains unchanged except for the focus on ensuring `i` is set correctly based on `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 elements where `values[i]` is `sum_value_digits` and all other elements are 0, `i` is `t + 2`, `sum_value_digits` is 0**
