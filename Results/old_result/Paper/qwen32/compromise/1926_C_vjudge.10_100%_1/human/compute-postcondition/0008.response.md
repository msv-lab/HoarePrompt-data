The code snippet provided is `sum_value_digits += int(x)`. This line indicates that the integer value of `x` is being added to `sum_value_digits`. However, the initial state does not provide a value for `x`, so we can only describe the change in terms of `x`.

Given that the initial state does not specify the value of `x`, we can only say that `sum_value_digits` will be increased by the integer value of `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 elements, all initialized to 0, `i` is 2, `sum_value_digits` is increased by `int(x)`**.
