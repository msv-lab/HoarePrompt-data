Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 0; `i` is 0; `arr` is a list with at least one element; `ans` is [0] if `c == n - 1`, otherwise `ans` remains an empty list; `c` is an integer such that `c == n - 1` if we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `c` retains its original value.**
