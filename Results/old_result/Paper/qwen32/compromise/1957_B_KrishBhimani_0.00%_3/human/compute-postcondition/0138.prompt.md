Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k_initial`; `arr` is a list of indices where the corresponding bit in `k_initial` is 1; `c` is 0; `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    if c == n - 1:
        ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
        break
    c += 1
    ans.append(1 << i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` must have at least one element; `c` is incremented by 1; `ans` has one additional element equal to `1 << i`. If `c` equals `n - 1`, `ans` has one additional element equal to `k0 - sum(ans)` before the new element was appended, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans` and `c` does not equal `n - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` must have at least two elements; `c` is incremented by 2; `ans` has one additional element equal to `1 << i`. If the new `c` equals `n - 1`, `ans` has one more additional element equal to `k0 - sum(ans)` before this new element was appended, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no further changes are made to `ans` and `c` does not equal `n - 1`. `ans` now includes an additional element equal to `1 << i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` must have at least two elements; `c` is incremented by 3; `ans` has one additional element equal to `1 << i`. If `c` equals `n - 1`, `ans` includes an additional element `k0 - sum(ans)` before the last element was added, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` has `1 << i` as its last element, and the loop or if statement continues. `i` is `i2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
