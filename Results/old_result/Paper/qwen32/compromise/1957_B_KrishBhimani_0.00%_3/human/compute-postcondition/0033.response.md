The code snippet appends the result of `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Let's break down the changes:

1. `ans` initially is either `[0, 1]` or `[1]` depending on the value of `c`.
2. The new element to be appended is `k0 - sum(ans)`.
   - If `ans` is `[0, 1]`, then `sum(ans)` is `1`. The new element is `k0 - 1`.
   - If `ans` is `[1]`, then `sum(ans)` is `1`. The new element is `k0 - 1`.

After the operation, the list `ans` will have an additional element which is `k0 - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 0; `i` is the next element in `arr` after the current `i`; `arr` is a list with at least one element; `ans` is `[0, 1, k0 - 1]` if `c == n - 1`, otherwise `ans` is `[1, k0 - 1]`; `c` is an integer such that `c == n - 1` if we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `c` retains its original value + 1.**
