The loop in question is:

```python
while k:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is not zero. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `k` must be greater than 0.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` divided by 4 (integer division) and `k` must be greater than 0
- `k0` is equal to the original value of `k` divided by 2 (integer division)
- `i` is 2
- if `k0` is odd, then `arr` is [0, 1]. Otherwise, `arr` is [1]

Since `k` is the only variable in the loop head and it must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue, we need to ensure that `k` remains greater than 0.

Thus, the state at the end of the previous iteration should be adjusted to ensure `k` is greater than 0. However, since the problem states that `k` must be greater than 0 initially, we can assume that `k` is still greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration for the loop to continue.

Therefore, no further adjustment is needed for `k` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` divided by 4 (integer division) and `k` must be greater than 0; `k0` is equal to the original value of `k` divided by 2 (integer division); `i` is 2; if `k0` is odd, then `arr` is [0, 1]. Otherwise, `arr` is [1]**
