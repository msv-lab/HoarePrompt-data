The code appends the value of `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `k0` is 0, and `ans` is an empty list, the sum of `ans` is 0. Therefore, the value being appended to `ans` is `0 - 0`, which is 0. After this operation, `ans` will contain one element, which is 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 0; `i` is 0; `arr` is a list with at least one element; `ans` is [0]; `c` is an integer such that `c == n - 1`.**
