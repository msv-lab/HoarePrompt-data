To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the provided initial state and understand the variables and their relationships step by step.

1. **Initial State Breakdown**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. This variable seems to be a loop control variable or a test case count, but it is not directly used in the provided snippet.
   - `l1` is a list of substrings from a new input string. 
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`. This means `n` is an integer that represents the length of the final list `ans`.
   - `k` is initialized to 0.
   - `k0` is the original value of `k`, which is 0.
   - `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`. Since `k0` is 0, `i` is 0 (the binary representation of 0 is "0").
   - `arr` is a list containing the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`. Since `k0` is 0, `arr` is an empty list.
   - `c` is an integer such that `c` is equal to `n - 1` or `arr` is exhausted. Initially, `c` is not set to any value, but it's described as the condition to stop adding elements to `ans`.
   - `ans` is a list that is constructed based on the values of `arr` and `n`. Specifically, it includes the elements `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr`, and if `c` reaches `n - 1`, it also includes `k0 - sum(ans)` as its last element, extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.

2. **Constructing `ans`**:
   - Since `arr` is an empty list, the loop that would populate `ans` with `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` does not execute.
   - Therefore, `ans` is initially an empty list.
   - Since `arr` is exhausted (because it's empty), `c` is set to `n - 1`.
   - The next step is to add `k0 - sum(ans)` to `ans`. Since `ans` is empty, `sum(ans)` is 0. Thus, `k0 - sum(ans)` is `0 - 0`, which is 0.
   - `ans` now contains a single element, which is 0.
   - Finally, `ans` is extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`. If `n` is 1, `ans` remains [0]. If `n` is greater than 1, `ans` will be [0] followed by `n - 1` zeros.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.

**Output Explanation**:
- If `n` is 1, `ans` is [0], and the output will be `0`.
- If `n` is greater than 1, `ans` will be [0] followed by `n - 1` zeros, and the output will be `0` followed by `n - 1` zeros separated by spaces.

Since we don't have the exact value of `n`, we can describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **0 followed by `n - 1` zeros (where `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`)**
