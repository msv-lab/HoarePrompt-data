Precondition: **The input consists of several test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the array and the number of operations, respectively. This is followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) which are the elements of the array. The sum of n and k across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
