The code provided reads two integers from the input, which are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state mentions that `n` and `k` remain unchanged, but since the code snippet assigns new values to them, they will now hold the values read from the input. The other variables (`c`, `maxi`, `i`, and `l`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` is the cumulative sum after the last element is processed, `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `maxi` and `c`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `l` is the input list.**
