The code snippet provided initializes a variable `c` to 0. None of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `l`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the integers read from the input, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `l` is a list containing `n` integers read from the input, `c` is 0.**
