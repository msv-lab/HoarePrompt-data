The code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` by comparing it with `c` and taking the larger of the two values. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `l`, `ele`, and `ele_next`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `c` is `c + ele`
- `maxi` is `max(ele_next, 0)`
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged
- `l` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, where `ele` is the third element in the list

After executing the code snippet, `maxi` will be updated to the maximum value between `c` and the previous `maxi`.

Output State: **`c` is `c + ele`, `maxi` is `max(c, max(ele_next, 0))`, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `l` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, where `ele` is the third element in the list.**
