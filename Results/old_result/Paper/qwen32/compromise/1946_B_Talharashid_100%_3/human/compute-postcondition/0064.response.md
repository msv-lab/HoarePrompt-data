The code `c = 0` sets the variable `c` to 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `l` is a list of integers from the input that must contain at least one integer, the current element `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`.**
