To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the components of the print statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `c` is the sum of the last contiguous subsequence of non-negative numbers. If the last number was negative, `c` is reset to 0.
- `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and `c`.
- `k` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we need to assume it is provided or defined elsewhere in the code.
- `l` is also not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we need to assume it is provided or defined elsewhere in the code.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)
```

Let's break down the components:
1. **`2 ** k`**: This is 2 raised to the power of `k`. The exact value depends on the value of `k`.
2. **`maxi`**: This is the maximum sum of the last contiguous subsequence of non-negative numbers encountered so far.
3. **`2 ** k * maxi`**: This is the result of multiplying `2 ** k` by `maxi`.
4. **`2 ** k * maxi - maxi`**: This is the result of subtracting `maxi` from `2 ** k * maxi`.
5. **`sum(l)`**: This is the sum of all elements in the list `l`.
6. **`2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)`**: This is the sum of the previous two results.
7. **`(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`**: This is the final result modulo 1000000007.

### Output Description:
Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

Since `k` and `l` are not explicitly provided in the initial state, we can't compute the exact numerical value. However, we can describe the output in terms of the given variables.

Output: **`(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` (where `k` is an integer, `maxi` is the maximum sum of the last contiguous subsequence of non-negative numbers, and `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`)**
