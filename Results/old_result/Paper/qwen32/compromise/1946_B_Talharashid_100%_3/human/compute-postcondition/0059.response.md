The code `c = 0` sets the variable `c` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `maxi`, `i`, or `l`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `maxi` and `c`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `l` is the new list of integers from the input.**
