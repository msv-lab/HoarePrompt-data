Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` is `c + ele`, `maxi` is `max(c, maxi)`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `l` is a list of integers from the input that must contain at least one integer. Additionally, either `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele`.**

Explanation: The value of `maxi` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the current value of `c`. All other variables remain as they were in the initial state.
