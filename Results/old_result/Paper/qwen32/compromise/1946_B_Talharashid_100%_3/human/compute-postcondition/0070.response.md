The code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of the current values of `c` and `maxi`. The values of `n`, `k`, `c`, and `ele` remain unchanged. The condition for updating `c` and `maxi` based on `ele` has already been evaluated before this line.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` is either 0 (if `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`) or `c + ele` (otherwise), `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `c` and `maxi`, and `ele` is the next element in the list `l`.**
