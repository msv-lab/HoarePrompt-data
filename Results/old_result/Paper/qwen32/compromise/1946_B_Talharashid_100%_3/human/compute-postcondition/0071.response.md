The code snippet `c = 0` sets the variable `c` to 0. This change does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `maxi`, or `ele`. Therefore, the only change in the output state is that `c` is now 0.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `c` and `maxi`, and `ele` is the next element in the list `l`.**
