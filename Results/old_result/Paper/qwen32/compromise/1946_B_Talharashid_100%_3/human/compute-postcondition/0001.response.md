The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5 and `k` must be at least 1. The values of `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are also mentioned but are not affected by the given code snippet.

After executing the provided code, `n` and `k` will hold the values read from the input. The values of `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged and are not specified in the code snippet. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the integers read from the input, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9)**
