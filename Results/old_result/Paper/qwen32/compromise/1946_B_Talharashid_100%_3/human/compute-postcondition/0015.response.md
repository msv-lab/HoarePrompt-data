The code snippet `c = 0` sets the variable `c` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. The values of `n`, `k`, the integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, the list `l`, the element `ele`, and `maxi` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9, `l` is a list containing `n` integers with at least 2 elements, `ele` is the next element in the list `l` after the previously processed element, `maxi` is the maximum value between its previous value and `c`, `c` is 0.**
