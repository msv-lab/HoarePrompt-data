Postcondition: **`c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 integer, and `ele` is the first element in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and the absolute value of `ele` is greater than or equal to `c`, then `c` remains 0 and `maxi` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is set to `ele` and `maxi` is set to the maximum of `ele` and 0.**
