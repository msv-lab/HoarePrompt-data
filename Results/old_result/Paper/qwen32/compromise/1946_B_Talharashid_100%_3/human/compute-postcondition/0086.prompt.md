You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of several test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the array and the number of operations, respectively. This is followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) which are the elements of the array. The sum of n and k across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        c = 0
        
        maxi = 0
        
        for ele in l:
            if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
                maxi = max(c, maxi)
                c = 0
            else:
                c += ele
                maxi = max(c, maxi)
        
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        
        print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)
        
    #State: `i` is the total number of test cases, `n` and `k` are the values from the last test case, `l` is the list from the last test case, `c` is the sum of the last contiguous subsequence of non-negative numbers in the last test case, and `maxi` is the maximum cumulative sum of the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` representing the length of an array, an integer `k` representing the number of operations, and an array of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function processes these inputs and returns the result of performing `k` operations on the array.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
