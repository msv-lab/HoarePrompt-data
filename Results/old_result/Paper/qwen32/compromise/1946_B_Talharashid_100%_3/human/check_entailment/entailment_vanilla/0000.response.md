Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations. In each operation, you can select any contiguous subarray of the array and insert the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array.

The key insight here is that to maximize the sum, you should focus on the maximum possible sum of any contiguous subarray, and then use that sum repeatedly to maximize the total sum of the array after `k` operations.

### Steps to Solve:
1. **Find the Maximum Subarray Sum**: Use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.
2. **Calculate the Result**: The optimal strategy is to add the maximum subarray sum to the array `k` times. This can be thought of as multiplying the maximum subarray sum by `2^k - 1` (since the first time you add it, it's just the sum, the second time you add it, it's added twice, and so on).
3. **Add the Original Array Sum**: To this, add the original sum of the array.
4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, take the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem as follows:
1. **Input Reading**: It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and the array `l`.
2. **Finding Maximum Subarray Sum**: It uses a modified version of Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum.
   - It iterates through the array and keeps a running sum `c` of the current subarray.
   - If the current element is negative and the running sum `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of the current element, it resets the running sum `c` to 0 and updates the maximum sum `maxi`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the current element to the running sum `c` and updates the maximum sum `maxi`.
3. **Calculating the Result**: It calculates the result using the formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.
   - However, this formula is incorrect. The correct formula should be `((2 ** k - 1) * maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for finding the maximum subarray sum is correct, but the formula for calculating the final result is incorrect. The formula should account for adding the maximum subarray sum `k` times, which is `(2 ** k - 1) * maxi` instead of `2 ** k * maxi - maxi`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
