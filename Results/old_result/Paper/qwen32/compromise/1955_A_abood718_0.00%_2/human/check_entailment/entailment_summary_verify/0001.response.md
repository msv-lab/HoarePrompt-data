Let's analyze the given program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts.
- The price for one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The price for two yogurts on promotion is `b` burles.
- We need to find the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates the minimum cost based on the following logic:

1. **Condition 1:** If `a * 2 < b`, it means buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than buying them as a pair. Therefore, the total cost is `n * a`.
2. **Condition 2:** If `n` is even, the best option is to buy all yogurts in pairs. Therefore, the total cost is `(n / 2) * b`.
3. **Condition 3:** If `n` is odd, the best option is to buy `(n - 1)` yogurts in pairs and one yogurt individually. Therefore, the total cost is `((n - 1) / 2) * b + a`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Handling of Odd `n`:** The code incorrectly prints `X` (which is `A // 2` or `(n - 1) / 2` for odd `n`) before printing the actual cost. This is an unnecessary print statement and does not contribute to the output.
- **Incorrect Calculation for Odd `n`:** The calculation for the cost when `n` is odd is incorrect. It should be `X * C + a` where `X = A // 2` and `a` is the price of one yogurt, but it incorrectly uses `X * C + B`.

### Function Summary:
The function summary describes the program's behavior accurately except for the unnecessary print statement and the incorrect calculation for odd `n`.

### Corrected Logic:
- If `a * 2 < b`, then the cost is `n * a`.
- If `a * 2 >= b`, then:
  - If `n` is even, the cost is `(n / 2) * b`.
  - If `n` is odd, the cost is `((n - 1) / 2) * b + a`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a * 2 < b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            pairs = n // 2
            remainder = n % 2
            print(pairs * b + remainder * a)
```

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the original program, it is not correct as it stands. The unnecessary print statement and the incorrect calculation for odd `n` make the program produce incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues with the program. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
