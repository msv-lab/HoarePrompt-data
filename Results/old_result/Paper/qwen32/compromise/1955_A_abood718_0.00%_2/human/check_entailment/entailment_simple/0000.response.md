Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and compare it with the problem requirements and the given examples.

1. **Input Handling:** The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, reading `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cost Calculation:**
   - The program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`B * 2`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`C`). If it is, it calculates the total cost as `A * B` (where `A` is the number of yogurts). However, this part of the logic is incorrect because it doesn't consider the case where buying in pairs is still cheaper even if `B * 2` is not less than `C`. The correct approach is to always consider the promotion price when possible.
   - If `A` (the number of yogurts) is even, the program correctly calculates the total cost as `A * C / 2`.
   - If `A` is odd, the program calculates the total cost as `(A // 2) * C + B`. This is correct because it buys as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and then buys the remaining yogurt at the regular price.

However, the logic for the first condition (`if B * 2 < C`) is flawed. The program should always try to maximize the number of yogurts bought at the promotion price, regardless of whether `B * 2` is less than `C`. The correct logic should be:

- Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price: `pairs = A // 2`.
- Calculate the number of yogurts that will be bought at the regular price: `remaining = A % 2`.
- The total cost is then `pairs * C + remaining * B`.

The provided code does not correctly implement this logic in the first condition.

Here's the corrected logic in the code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        pairs = A // 2
        remaining = A % 2
        print(pairs * C + remaining * B)

#State: t is the same integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. All test cases have been processed and the corresponding outputs have been printed.
```

Given the incorrect logic in the original program, the provided code is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
