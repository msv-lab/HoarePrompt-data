You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`. For each test case, it prints a result based on specific conditions: if `B * 2` is less than `C`, it prints `A * B`; if `A` is even, it prints `A * C / 2`; otherwise, it prints `A // 2` followed by `(A // 2) * C + B`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts.
- The price for one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The price for two yogurts on promotion is `b` burles.
- We need to find the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates the minimum cost based on the following logic:

1. **Condition 1:** If `a * 2 < b`, it means buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than buying them as a pair. Therefore, the total cost is `n * a`.
2. **Condition 2:** If `n` is even, the best option is to buy all yogurts in pairs. Therefore, the total cost is `(n / 2) * b`.
3. **Condition 3:** If `n` is odd, the best option is to buy `(n - 1)` yogurts in pairs and one yogurt individually. Therefore, the total cost is `((n - 1) / 2) * b + a`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Handling of Odd `n`:** The code incorrectly prints `X` (which is `A // 2` or `(n - 1) / 2` for odd `n`) before printing the actual cost. This is an unnecessary print statement and does not contribute to the output.
- **Incorrect Calculation for Odd `n`:** The calculation for the cost when `n` is odd is incorrect. It should be `X * C + B` where `X = A // 2` and `B` is the price of one yogurt, but it should be `X * C + a` instead of `X * C + B`.

### Corrected Logic:
- If `a * 2 < b`, then the cost is `n * a`.
- If `a * 2 >= b`, then:
  - If `n` is even, the cost is `(n / 2) * b`.
  - If `n` is odd, the cost is `((n - 1) / 2) * b + a`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a * 2 < b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            pairs = n // 2
            remainder = n % 2
            print(pairs * b + remainder * a)

# This corrected code will handle all cases correctly.
```

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the original program, it is not correct as it stands. Therefore, the Correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
