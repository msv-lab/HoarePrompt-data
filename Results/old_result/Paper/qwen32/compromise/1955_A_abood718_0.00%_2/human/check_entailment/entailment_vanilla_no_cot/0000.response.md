Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a logical error in the handling of the case where the number of yogurts (A) is odd. Let's analyze the issue and provide a corrected version of the program.

### Issues in the Provided Program:
1. **Handling Odd Number of Yogurts:**
   - The code incorrectly prints the value of `X` (which is `A // 2`) before calculating the total cost.
   - When `A` is odd, the program should calculate the cost as `(A // 2) * C + B` but the `print(X)` statement is misplaced and incorrect.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        # If buying two yogurts at promotion price is cheaper than buying two separately
        if 2 * B < C:
            print(A * B)
        else:
            # Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts and the remaining single yogurt
            pairs = A // 2
            remainder = A % 2
            # Total cost is pairs * promotion price + remainder * single yogurt price
            print(pairs * C + remainder * B)

func()
```

### Explanation:
- **If `2 * B < C`:** It means buying two yogurts separately is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price. Thus, the total cost is `A * B`.
- **Else:** Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts (`pairs = A // 2`) and the number of remaining single yogurts (`remainder = A % 2`). The total cost is then `pairs * C + remainder * B`.

The corrected program ensures that the logic is correctly applied to handle both even and odd numbers of yogurts and calculates the minimum cost accurately.
