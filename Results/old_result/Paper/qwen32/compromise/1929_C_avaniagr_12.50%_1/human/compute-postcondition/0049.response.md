To determine the output, let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
2. `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers with `x` being at least 0.
3. `z` is calculated after `x + 1` iterations using the formula `z = z + (z // (k - 1)) + 1`.
4. `i` is initialized to `x`.
5. `a` is greater than or equal to `z`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `z`, or `i`. The initial state does not affect the output of this specific print statement because it does not involve any of these variables.

### Output:
The print statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
