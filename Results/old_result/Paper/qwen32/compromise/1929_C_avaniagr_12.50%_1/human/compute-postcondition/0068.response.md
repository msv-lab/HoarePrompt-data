The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the loop statement `for i in range(x + 1):`, the loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than `x + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (since `i` is updated at the end of each iteration in a `for` loop). Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2.

The value of `x` does not need to be adjusted because it determines the upper limit of the loop, and it remains constant throughout the loop's execution.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers read from the input with `x` being at least 0; `z` is 2 + 1 // (k - 1); `i` is 2**
