The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationship between `n`, `a`, and `b`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `a` multiplied by `n`. Otherwise, it calculates a more complex expression involving `b`, `a`, and `n`, and prints the result.
