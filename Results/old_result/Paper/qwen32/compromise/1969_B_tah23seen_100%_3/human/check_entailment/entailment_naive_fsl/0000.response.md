Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the described cyclic shift operations. Let's analyze why:

The function `func_1` calculates the cost in a way that does not account for the optimal cyclic shifts required to sort the string. Specifically, the function only considers the number of '1's encountered before a '0' and adds the cost as `one + 1` for each such case. This approach does not consider the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to achieve the sorted order.

Let's consider a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
1
11010
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

Explanation of the expected output:
- Perform a cyclic shift on the substring `[1, 3]`: `11010 -> 01110` (cost = 3)
- The string is now sorted.

However, the provided code would calculate the cost as follows:
- `one = 2` (encountered two '1's)
- The first '0' is encountered, so `cost += one + 1 = 3`
- The second '0' is encountered, so `cost += one + 1 = 3`
- Total cost = 6 (which is incorrect)

Thus, the code does not always produce the minimum cost required to sort the string, and therefore, it is incorrect.
