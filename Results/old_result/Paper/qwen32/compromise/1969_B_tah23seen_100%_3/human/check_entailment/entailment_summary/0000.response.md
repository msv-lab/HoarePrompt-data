Reasoning:

The provided program calculates the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The logic behind the program is to count the number of '1's encountered and then, for each '0' that follows, add the number of '1's encountered plus one to the cost. This is based on the idea that each '0' that follows a '1' needs to be shifted past all the '1's that came before it, and the cost of each shift is the length of the substring being shifted.

Let's break down the logic with the example cases:

1. For the input string "10":
   - The first character is '1', so `one` is incremented to 1.
   - The second character is '0', and since `one` is greater than 0, the cost is incremented by `one + 1`, which is 2.
   - The minimum cost to sort "10" is 2.

2. For the input string "0000":
   - There are no '1's, so `one` remains 0.
   - There are no '0's following any '1's, so the cost remains 0.
   - The string is already sorted, so the cost is 0.

3. For the input string "11000":
   - The first two characters are '1's, so `one` is incremented to 2.
   - The next three characters are '0's, and since `one` is greater than 0, the cost is incremented by `one + 1` for each '0', which is 3 times 3 (2 + 1).
   - The minimum cost to sort "11000" is 9.

4. For the input string "101011":
   - The first character is '1', so `one` is incremented to 1.
   - The second character is '0', and since `one` is greater than 0, the cost is incremented by `one + 1`, which is 2.
   - The third character is '1', so `one` is incremented to 2.
   - The fourth character is '0', and since `one` is greater than 0, the cost is incremented by `one + 1`, which is 3.
   - The fifth character is '1', so `one` is incremented to 3.
   - The sixth character is '1', so `one` is incremented to 4.
   - The minimum cost to sort "101011" is 5.

5. For the input string "01101001":
   - The first character is '0', so `one` remains 0.
   - The second character is '1', so `one` is incremented to 1.
   - The third character is '1', so `one` is incremented to 2.
   - The fourth character is '0', and since `one` is greater than 0, the cost is incremented by `one + 1`, which is 3.
   - The fifth character is '1', so `one` is incremented to 3.
   - The sixth character is '0', and since `one` is greater than 0, the cost is incremented by `one + 1`, which is 4.
   - The seventh character is '0', and since `one` is greater than 0, the cost is incremented by `one + 1`, which is 4.
   - The eighth character is '1', so `one` is incremented to 4.
   - The minimum cost to sort "01101001" is 11.

The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
