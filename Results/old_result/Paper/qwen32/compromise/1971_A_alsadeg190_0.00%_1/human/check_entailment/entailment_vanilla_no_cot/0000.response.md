Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the `if` statement. The `if` condition should check if `x` is greater than `y` to print `y` first, followed by `x`, and vice versa. However, the current implementation prints `x` first when it is greater than `y`, which is incorrect. The correct implementation should be:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        if x > y:
            print(y, x)
        else:
            print(x, y)
```

In this corrected version, if `x` is greater than `y`, it prints `y` first, followed by `x`, ensuring the output is the minimum value followed by the maximum value for each test case.
