### Reasoning:

Let's carefully go through the program and the annotated version to ensure that the program meets all the conditions specified in the problem description.

#### Problem Conditions Recap:
1. The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password string itself.

2. **Function `func_1(n, password)`:**
   - **Initialization:** Two separate lists, `letters` and `digits`, are initialized to store the letters and digits from the password, respectively.
   - **Character Classification:**
     - The program iterates through each character in the password.
     - If the character is a digit, it is appended to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it is appended to the `letters` list.
   - **Sorting Check:**
     - The program checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns `'NO'`.
     - The program checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns `'NO'`.
   - **Digit After Letter Check:**
     - The program iterates through each character in the password (except the last one).
     - If a letter is followed by a digit, it returns `'NO'`.
   - **Return 'YES':**
     - If none of the above conditions are violated, the password is considered strong, and the program returns `'YES'`.

#### Verification Against the Problem Description:

- **Condition 1:** The problem states that the input will consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, so no explicit check is necessary.
- **Condition 2:** The program correctly checks that no letter is followed by a digit.
- **Condition 3:** The program correctly checks that the digits are sorted.
- **Condition 4:** The program correctly checks that the letters are sorted.

The annotations provided in the annotated version of the code align with the expected behavior of the program and confirm that the program correctly implements the logic to verify the password conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to verify whether a given password meets Monocarp's criteria for being strong.

**Final: True**
