Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically, it does not correctly handle the case where the password consists only of digits or only of letters. The function `func_1` separates the letters and digits into two lists, sorts them, and checks if they are sorted individually. However, it does not ensure that the digits come after all the letters in the password, which is a requirement.

Let's consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
2
3
abc
3
123
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
YES
```

The program will correctly identify these passwords as "YES" because they are sorted and do not have digits following letters. However, let's consider another test case:

**Test Case:**
```
2
4
ab12
4
12ab
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
NO
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
YES
```

In the second test case, the password "12ab" should return "NO" because the digits are not following all the letters. The program does not correctly handle this scenario.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not ensure that all digits come after all letters in the password.
