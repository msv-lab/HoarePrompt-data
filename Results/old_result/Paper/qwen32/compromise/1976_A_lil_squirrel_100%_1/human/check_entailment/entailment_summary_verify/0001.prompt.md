You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` checks if a given password meets specific criteria: it must contain lowercase Latin letters and digits only, the letters must be in alphabetical order, the digits must be in ascending order, and no letter can be immediately followed by a digit. If any of these conditions are not met, the function returns 'NO'; otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly verifies whether a given password meets Monocarp's criteria for being strong.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password string itself.

2. **Function `func_1(n, password)`:**
   - **Initialization:** Two separate lists, `letters` and `digits`, are initialized to store the letters and digits from the password, respectively.
   - **Character Classification:**
     - The program iterates through each character in the password.
     - If the character is a digit, it is appended to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it is appended to the `letters` list.
   - **Sorting Check:**
     - The program checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns `'NO'`.
     - The program checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns `'NO'`.
   - **Digit After Letter Check:**
     - The program iterates through each character in the password (except the last one).
     - If a letter is followed by a digit, it returns `'NO'`.
   - **Return 'YES':**
     - If none of the above conditions are violated, the password is considered strong, and the program returns `'YES'`.

### Verification Against the Problem Description:

- **Condition 1:** The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The program does not explicitly check for this condition, but it assumes that the input will be valid as per the problem statement.
- **Condition 2:** There should be no digit that comes after a letter. This is correctly checked by iterating through the password and ensuring that no letter is followed by a digit.
- **Condition 3:** All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order. This is correctly checked by comparing the `digits` list to its sorted version.
- **Condition 4:** All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order. This is correctly checked by comparing the `letters` list to its sorted version.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to verify whether a given password meets Monocarp's criteria for being strong.
