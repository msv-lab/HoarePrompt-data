### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided solution in detail, focusing on the correctness of the `func_1` function, which is critical for calculating the minimum cost of placing supports in a single row.

#### Function `func_1(row: List[int], d: int)`

The purpose of this function is to calculate the minimum cost to place supports in a single row such that the distance between adjacent supports is no more than `d`. Here is a detailed breakdown of the function:

1. **Initialization of First `d-1` Cells**:
   ```python
   for i in range(0, d - 1):
       row[i] = row[i] + 1
   ```
   This loop correctly adds 1 to the depth of the first `d-1` cells, ensuring that supports are placed in these cells.

2. **Cost Calculation for Remaining Cells**:
   ```python
   for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
       row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
   ```
   This loop aims to calculate the minimum cost to place supports in each cell from `d-1` to the end of the row. However, there are issues with this logic:
   - The `min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i])` part is intended to find the minimum cost of placing supports in the previous `d` cells (excluding the current cell). However, the slice `row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]` includes `d+1` elements, which is incorrect. It should only consider the previous `d` elements.
   - The logic does not ensure that the distance between adjacent supports is no more than `d`. Instead, it calculates the minimum cost based on the previous `d` cells but does not enforce the placement of supports at the correct intervals.

#### Correct Implementation of `func_1`

To correctly implement `func_1`, we need to use dynamic programming to ensure that the distance between adjacent supports is no more than `d`. Here's a correct implementation:

```python
def func_1(row: List[int], d: int) -> int:
    n = len(row)
    dp = [float('inf')] * n
    dp[0] = 1  # Support at the first column
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(max(0, i - d), i):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + row[i] + 1)
    return dp[-1]  # Support at the last column
```

This implementation uses a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to place supports up to column `i`. It iterates through each column and updates the cost based on the previous `d` columns.

#### Function `func_2()`

The function `func_2` reads the input, computes the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`, and then finds the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows. The logic here is correct if `func_1` is correctly implemented.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to place supports in a single row while satisfying the constraints on the distance between supports. The provided solution is incorrect due to the flawed implementation of `func_1`.

**Final: False**
