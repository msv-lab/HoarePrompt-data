Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap
The problem involves finding the minimum cost to build `k` consecutive bridges over a river grid, where each bridge spans from the first to the last column. The cost of placing a support in any cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`. There are constraints on the placement of supports, including that they must be placed in the first and last columns and that the distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.

### Provided Program Analysis

#### Function 1: `func_1`
This function calculates the minimum cost to build a single bridge over a given row. It uses dynamic programming to determine the cost of placing supports such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

- **Initialization**: The first `d-1` supports are placed at the beginning of the row, and their cost is simply `a_{i,j} + 1`.
- **Dynamic Programming**: For each subsequent cell, the cost is calculated as the minimum cost of placing a support at any of the previous `d+1` cells (to ensure the distance constraint) plus the current cell's depth plus one.
- **Output**: The function returns the cost of placing supports in the last column.

#### Function 2: `func_2`
This function handles the input and output for multiple test cases.

- **Input Parsing**: It reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the dimensions of the grid (`n`, `m`), the number of bridges (`k`), and the maximum distance (`d`).
- **Cost Calculation**: It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
- **Total Cost Calculation**: It computes the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum among them.
- **Output**: It prints the minimum total cost for each test case.

### Correctness Evaluation

#### Function 1: `func_1`
The logic in `func_1` seems to correctly implement the dynamic programming approach to find the minimum cost for a single row. It ensures that:
- Supports are placed in the first and last columns.
- The distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

#### Function 2: `func_2`
The logic in `func_2` also seems correct. It:
- Properly handles multiple test cases.
- Computes the cost for each row.
- Finds the minimum total cost for any set of `k` consecutive rows.

### Conclusion
The program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the minimum cost for each row using dynamic programming and then finds the optimal set of `k` consecutive rows.

Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

**Correctness: True**
