Reasoning: 
The provided code is intended to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` bridges over consecutive rows in a grid, given constraints on the maximum distance `d` between supports. Let's break down the functions and their roles to determine if they correctly solve the problem.

### Function 1 (`func_1`):
- **Purpose**: To compute the minimum cost to install supports in a single row of the grid.
- **Approach**: 
  - It initializes the first `d-1` elements by adding 1 to them.
  - For each subsequent element, it calculates the cost by adding 1 to the cell's depth and the minimum cost of placing a support within the previous `d` elements.
  - It returns the cost of placing supports in the last cell of the row.

### Function 2 (`func_2`):
- **Purpose**: To compute the minimum total cost of placing `k` bridges over consecutive rows in the grid.
- **Approach**:
  - It reads the input parameters (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`) and the grid (`rows`).
  - It applies `func_1` to each row to compute the cost of placing a single bridge in that row.
  - It then iterates over all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows and computes the total cost for each set.
  - It prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

### Analysis:
- **Function 1**: The approach seems to be an attempt to use dynamic programming to minimize the cost of placing supports in a row. However, the implementation has issues. The function does not correctly handle the placement of supports with the constraint `d`. The logic of adding the minimum of the previous `d` elements is flawed and does not ensure that the supports are placed at most `d` cells apart.
- **Function 2**: This function correctly iterates over all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows and computes the total cost for each set. However, it relies on `func_1` to compute the cost of a single row, which is incorrect as explained above.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to ensure that supports are placed with a maximum distance `d` between them. Therefore, the overall program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
