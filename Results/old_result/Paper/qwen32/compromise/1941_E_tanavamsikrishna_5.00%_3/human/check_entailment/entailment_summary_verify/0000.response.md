Let's carefully analyze the problem, the provided code, and the function summaries to determine whether the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Description Recap

The goal is to build `k` bridges across a river grid with `n` rows and `m` columns, ensuring that supports are placed in the first and last columns and that the distance between any two adjacent supports does not exceed `d`. The cost of placing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.

### Code Analysis

#### Function `func_1`
- **Purpose**: Calculate the minimum cost of placing supports in a single row.
- **Implementation**:
  - The first loop sets the cost of the first `d-1` cells to `row[i] + 1`. This is incorrect because the problem requires supports at the first and last columns, which should always be `row[0] + 1` and `row[-1] + 1`.
  - The second loop calculates the cost of placing supports while ensuring that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`. The logic here is flawed:
    - The line `row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1` does not correctly handle the placement of supports.
    - It attempts to find the minimum cost of placing a support at position `i` by considering the minimum cost of placing a support within `d` positions before it, but this does not guarantee the correct placement of supports to minimize the total cost while adhering to the constraints.

#### Function `func_2`
- **Purpose**: Read input, calculate the cost for each row using `func_1`, and find the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.
- **Implementation**:
  - Reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
  - Reads the grid `rows`.
  - Computes the cost for each row using `func_1`.
  - Sums the costs of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.

### Function Summary
The summary states that the function calculates the minimum total cost of placing `k` bridges in a grid such that the maximum distance between supports does not exceed `d`. However, the implementation of `func_1` is flawed, which affects the overall correctness of the program.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment correctly identifies that the logic in `func_1` is flawed and that the program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program is indeed incorrect due to the flawed logic in `func_1`.

**Final: False**
