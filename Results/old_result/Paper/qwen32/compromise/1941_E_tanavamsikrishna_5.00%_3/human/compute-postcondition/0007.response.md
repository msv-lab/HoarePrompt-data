Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, which are positive integers representing the number of rows, number of columns, number of bridges, and the maximum distance between supports, respectively. It also accepts a 2D list `rows` of integers where each sublist represents a row in the river grid and contains `m` integers, with the first and last integers being 0. The function returns a value indicating whether it is possible to place `k` bridges in the grid such that the maximum distance between supports does not exceed `d`.**
