The code snippet sets the variable `l` to the string `'YES'`. This change overrides the initial condition that `l` is `'YES'` only if there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is `'YES'`, `t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the user's inputs, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1**.
