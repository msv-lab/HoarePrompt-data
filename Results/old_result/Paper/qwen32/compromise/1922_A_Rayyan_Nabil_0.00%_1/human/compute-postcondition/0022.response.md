Output State: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index i (0 <= i < n) such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]; otherwise, l is 'NO', `i` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string, `b` is the input string.**

Explanation: The variable `b` is assigned the value of the new input string. The other variables (`l`, `i`, `t`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged as per the given code snippet.
