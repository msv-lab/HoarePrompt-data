The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This line of code will reassign the value of `n` to whatever integer value is provided by the input. The initial state specifies that `n` is already an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20. However, after executing this line, `n` will be reassigned to the new input value. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `n` is the new input integer, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `l` is 'YES'**.
