### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine how many values of `k` fit the given constraints for Vasya's position `n` and number `x`.
   - The sequence of positions is periodic with a period of `2k - 2`.
   - The sequence starts with numbers `1, 2, ..., k`, then `k - 1, k - 2, ..., 2`, and repeats.

2. **Constraints:**
   - `k > 1`
   - `1 <= x < n <= 10^9`
   - We need to find all `k` such that Vasya's position `n` corresponds to the number `x` in the sequence.

3. **Approach:**
   - The sequence can be split into two parts: the increasing part `1, 2, ..., k` and the decreasing part `k - 1, k - 2, ..., 2`.
   - For a given `k`, the position `n` can correspond to `x` in either the increasing or the decreasing part.
   - We need to check both possibilities and count valid `k` values.

4. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - For the increasing part: `n = (i - 1) * (2k - 2) + x` for some integer `i`.
   - For the decreasing part: `n = (i - 1) * (2k - 2) + (2k - x)` for some integer `i`.
   - Rearranging, we get two equations:
     - `n - x = (i - 1) * (2k - 2)`
     - `n - (2k - x) = (i - 1) * (2k - 2)`
   - Both equations imply that `n - x` and `n - (2k - x)` must be divisible by `2k - 2`.
   - We need to find `k` such that these conditions hold and `k >= x`.

5. **Implementation Details:**
   - The program uses a function `func_1` to find divisors of a number.
   - It checks two conditions based on the equations derived above.
   - It ensures that the calculated `k` is at least `x` and is even.

6. **Issues in the Given Program:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return divisors of a number, but the returned list is not correctly used.
   - The program does not correctly calculate or use the divisors to find valid `k` values.
   - The output list is not properly populated or printed.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid `k` values.
   - The logic for checking divisors and calculating `k` is flawed.

### Correctness: **False**
