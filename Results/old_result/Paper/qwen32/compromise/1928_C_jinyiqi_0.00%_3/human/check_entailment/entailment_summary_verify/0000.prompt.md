You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    output = list(set(output))

def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a list of all divisors of `x`, arranged such that divisors greater than the square root of `x` appear first, followed by divisors less than or equal to the square root of `x` in descending order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description. Let's analyze the code and identify the problems.

### Issues in the Provided Code:

1. **Undefined Function `func_1`:** The function `func_1` is called but not defined anywhere in the provided code. This will result in a `NameError` when the program is executed.

2. **Logic Errors:**
    - The program attempts to calculate the divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x` and checks if `(s + 2) / 2` is a valid `k` value. However, the logic to determine `k` from these divisors is incorrect.
    - The program does not correctly handle the condition for `k` values. Specifically, it should check if the calculated `k` fits the pattern described in the problem statement.

3. **Output Handling:**
    - The program calculates potential `k` values but does not print them. It seems like the intention was to print the count of valid `k` values, but the code does not do that.

4. **Edge Cases:**
    - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `n` and `x` are very large or when `x` is close to `n`.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to determine the values of `k` that fit the pattern described. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def count_valid_k(n, x):
    count = 0
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        period = 2 * k - 2
        position_in_period = (n - 1) % period
        if position_in_period < k and position_in_period + 1 == x:
            count += 1
        elif position_in_period >= k and 2 * k - 2 - position_in_period == x:
            count += 1
    return count

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_k(n, x))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:

1. **Loop through Possible `k` Values:**
    - The loop iterates over all possible `k` values from 2 to `n`.

2. **Calculate the Period:**
    - For each `k`, the period is `2 * k - 2`.

3. **Determine Position in the Period:**
    - The position in the period is calculated as `(n - 1) % period`.

4. **Check if the Position Matches the Given `x`:**
    - If the position in the period is less than `k` and matches `x - 1`, or if it is greater than or equal to `k` and matches `2 * k - 2 - position_in_period`, then `k` is valid.

5. **Count Valid `k` Values:**
    - The count of valid `k` values is returned and printed for each test case.

This corrected program ensures that all possible `k` values are checked and correctly handles the conditions described in the problem statement.
