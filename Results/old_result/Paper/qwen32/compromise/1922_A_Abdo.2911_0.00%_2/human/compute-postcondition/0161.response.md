Output State: **`match_a_b` is False if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` and `template[i]` is lowercase, otherwise `match_a_b` retains its original value; `match_c` is False; `n` is greater than 2; `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the execution of the `break` statement causes the program to exit the current loop or if statement. The values of `match_a_b`, `match_c`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged, except that the loop or if statement is exited.
