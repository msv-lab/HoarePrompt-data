The code appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the list `template`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and the initial state of `template` remain unchanged except for `template` which now includes the additional character. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 in the initial state, so after the operation, `i` is `i + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `template` is updated to include `a[i]` at the end; `i` is `i + 1`.**
