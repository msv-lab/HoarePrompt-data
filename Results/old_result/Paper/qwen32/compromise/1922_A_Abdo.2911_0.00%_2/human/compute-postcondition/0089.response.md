Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is a positive integer input by the user; `a` is the new string input by the user; `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `template` is a list of `n` characters where each character is the lowercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] != b[i]`; `match_a_b` retains its initial value; `match_c` is `False` if `match_a_b` is `True` and `c` does not match `template`, otherwise `match_c` retains its initial value or becomes `True` if `c` matches `template`.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is reassigned to the new string input by the user. All other variables retain their initial values or states.
