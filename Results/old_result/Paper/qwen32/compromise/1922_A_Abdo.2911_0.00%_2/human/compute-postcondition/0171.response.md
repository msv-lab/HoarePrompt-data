The given initial state describes the conditions of the variables `match_a_b` and `match_c`. Specifically:
- `match_a_b` is True if no mismatches were found according to the loop conditions, otherwise it is False.
- `match_c` is True.
- It is not the case that `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False.

The print statement in the code is:
```python
print('NO')
```

Notice that the print statement does not depend on the values of `match_a_b` or `match_c`. It simply prints the string 'NO'.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
