Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings input by the user; `match_a_b` retains its initial value; `match_c` retains its initial value; `template` is a list. If the character at index `i` in `a` is equal to the character at index `i` in `b`, `template` contains the character `a[i]`. Otherwise, `template` contains the uppercase version of `a[i]`.**
