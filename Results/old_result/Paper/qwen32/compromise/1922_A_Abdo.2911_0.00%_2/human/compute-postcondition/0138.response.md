Output State: **`match_a_b` is True if no mismatches were found according to the loop conditions, otherwise `match_a_b` is False; `match_c` is True.**

Natural language: The variable `match_c` has been set to `True`. The state of `match_a_b` remains unchanged, indicating that it is still dependent on whether no mismatches were found according to the loop conditions.
