Postcondition: **`match_a_b` is False if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, otherwise `match_a_b` retains its original value. `match_c` is True. `n` is greater than 0. `i` is 0. The character at index `i` of `template` is lowercase. If `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, the loop or if statement is broken out of.**
