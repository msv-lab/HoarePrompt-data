Output State: **`match_a_b` is False; `match_c` is True; `_` is the current value of `_` plus `n` and `_` is less than `t`; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is the stripped input string; `b` is the stripped input string; `c` is the stripped input string; `template` is a list that includes the character `a[i]` at the end if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, otherwise it includes the uppercase character `a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `n`. The current element `template[i]` is lowercase and either `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`.**

In simple terms, the variable `match_a_b` has been set to False. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
