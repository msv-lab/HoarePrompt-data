The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is implicitly incremented by 1 (since it is a counter in the `range(t)` loop).

Given that the loop has just completed an iteration, `_` must have been one less than `t` at the start of that iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `_` will be incremented by 1, meaning `_` should be the current value of `_` plus 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must still be less than `t`.

Since the values of `match_a_b` and `match_c` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's continuation, they remain unchanged.

State: **`match_a_b` is True if no mismatches were found according to the loop conditions, otherwise `match_a_b` is False; `match_c` is True; `_` is the current value of `_` plus 1, and `_` must be less than `t`**
