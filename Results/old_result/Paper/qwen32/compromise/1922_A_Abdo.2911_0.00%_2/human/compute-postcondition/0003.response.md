The code snippet `a = input().strip()` reads a new input string and assigns it to the variable `a`, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. The initial state mentioned that `a` was a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, but this value is overwritten by the new input. The variables `t`, `n`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
