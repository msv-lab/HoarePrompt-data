Postcondition: **`match_a_b` is `True` if the loop completes all `n` iterations without setting `match_a_b` to `False`. `match_c` is `False` if `c[i]` does not match `template[i]` according to the given conditions. `_` is `current_value_of_ + n` and is less than `t`. `n` is greater than 0. `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the same. `template` remains the same. `i` is 4. If `template[i]` is lowercase and `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, or if `template[i]` is not lowercase and `c[i].lower()` is not equal to `template[i].lower()`, the most internal loop is broken out of. Otherwise, the loop continues.**
