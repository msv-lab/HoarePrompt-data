The code snippet appends the uppercase version of the character at position `i` from string `a` to the list `template`. Given the initial state, after the execution of this code, `template` will no longer be an empty list but will contain one element, which is the uppercase version of `a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is a new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is a new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `template` is a list containing the uppercase version of `a[i]`; the characters at position `i` in `a` and `b` are not equal.**
