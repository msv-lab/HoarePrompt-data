Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `template` is a list of `n` characters where each character is the lowercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] != b[i]`. If `template[i]` is lowercase and either `a[i] != template[i]` or `b[i] != template[i]`, or if `template[i]` is uppercase and either `a[i].lower() == template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`, `match_a_b` is set to `False`. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains unchanged. If `match_a_b` remains `True`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
