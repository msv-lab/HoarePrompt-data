Output State: **`match_a_b` is False because a mismatch was found according to the loop conditions; `match_c` is False; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; the character at index `i` of `template` is lowercase; and `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. The loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In simple terms, the variables `match_a_b`, `match_c`, `n`, `i`, the character at index `i` of `template`, and the comparison between `c[i]` and `template[i]` remain unchanged. The only change is that the loop or if statement is exited.
