Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is a positive integer input by the user; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings input by the user; `match_a_b` is True; `match_c` retains its initial value; `template` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, otherwise `a[i].upper()`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
            match_a_b = False
            break
    elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
        ].lower():
        match_a_b = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings input by the user, `match_c` retains its initial value, and `template` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, otherwise `a[i].upper()`. If `template[i]` is lowercase, `match_a_b` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if either `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. Otherwise, if `template[i]` is not lowercase and either `a[i].lower() == template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`, `match_a_b` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_a_b` retains its initial value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 4, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings input by the user, `match_c` retains its initial value, `template` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, otherwise `a[i].upper()`. If `template[4]` is lowercase and either `a[4] != template[4]` or `b[4] != template[4]`, `match_a_b` is set to False. If `template[4]` is not lowercase and either `a[4].lower() == template[4].lower()` or `b[4].lower() == template[4].lower()`, `match_a_b` is set to False. Otherwise, `match_a_b` retains its initial value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 4, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings input by the user, `match_c` retains its initial value, `template` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, otherwise `a[i].upper()`. If `template[4]` is lowercase and either `a[4] != template[4]` or `b[4] != template[4]`, `match_a_b` is set to False. If `template[4]` is not lowercase and either `a[4].lower() == template[4].lower()` or `b[4].lower() == template[4].lower()`, `match_a_b` is set to False. If `template[4]` is lowercase and `a[4] == template[4]` and `b[4] == template[4]`, or if `template[4]` is not lowercase and neither `a[4].lower() == template[4].lower()` nor `b[4].lower() == template[4].lower()`, `match_a_b` retains its initial value. `i` is 4.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
