The only variable in the loop head of the provided `for` loop is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust only the state of `i` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000
- `n` is greater than 0
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters
- `template` is a list of `n` characters where each character is the lowercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] != b[i]`
- `match_a_b` retains its initial value
- `i` is 1

The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `template`, `match_a_b`) do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `template` is a list of `n` characters where each character is the lowercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] != b[i]`, `match_a_b` retains its initial value, `i` is 2**
