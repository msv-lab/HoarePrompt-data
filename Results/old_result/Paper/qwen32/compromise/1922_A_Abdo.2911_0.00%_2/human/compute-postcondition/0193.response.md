Output State: **`match_a_b` is True if no mismatches were found according to the loop conditions, otherwise `match_a_b` is False; `match_c` is True; `_` is the current value of `_` plus `n` and `_` is less than `t`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the stripped input string; `b` is the stripped input string; `c` is the stripped input string; `template` is a list that includes the character `a[i]` at the end if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, otherwise it includes the uppercase character `a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `n`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `template` will contain the characters from string `a` at each position `i`. If the character at position `i` in `a` matches the character at the same position in `b`, it will be in lowercase in `template`; otherwise, it will be in uppercase. The variable `match_a_b` will be `True` if all characters matched between `a` and `b`; otherwise, it will be `False`. The variable `_` will have been incremented by `n` times, and it will still be less than `t`. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
