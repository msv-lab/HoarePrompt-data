Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 999, `n` is the newly input integer, `a` is a list with at least one element, the current element `a[i]` is 0, `res` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `a[i]`) remain unchanged.
