The given initial state provides information about the variables and their relationships:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list.
- `res` is the number of 0s in the list `a`.

The task is to determine what will be printed by the `print(res)` statement.

Since the exact contents of the list `a` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `res`. However, we know that `res` is the count of 0s in the list `a`.

Therefore, the `print(res)` statement will output the number of 0s in the list `a`.

Output: **res (where res is the number of 0s in the list `a`)**
