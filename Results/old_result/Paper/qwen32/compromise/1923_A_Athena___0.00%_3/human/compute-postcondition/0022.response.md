Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list with at least one element, e.g., `a = [some_value]`; `res` is 1; `i` is 0; the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[i]`) is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
