The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Given the initial state, the first element of `a` is `0`, so after executing the code, `a` will no longer contain this `0` as its first element. The values of `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input line with the first element (which was 0) removed and `a` is not empty; `res` is 0.**
