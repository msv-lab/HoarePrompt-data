### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its logic step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
- We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in the string `s`.
- If they do, we output "YES".
- If not, we output "NO" followed by one such string of length `n` that does not appear as a subsequence in `s`.

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` (length of `s`).
   - It then reads the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to check if the string `s` contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` letters.
   - It initializes an alphabet set containing the first `k` letters.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and updates the alphabet set by removing letters found in `s`.
   - When the alphabet set becomes empty, it resets it and appends the current character to `s2`.
   - It returns a tuple containing:
     - A boolean indicating if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
     - A substring of `s1` starting from a specific index.
     - The string `s2` which seems to be the last character of `s` repeated.

3. **Logic Flaws:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to check for all possible subsequences of length `n`.
   - The logic for constructing `s2` and determining the missing subsequence is flawed.
   - The condition `len(s1) >= n * k` does not guarantee that all subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`.

4. **Output Construction:**
   - If the boolean returned by `func_1` is `False`, the code attempts to construct a missing subsequence by finding the first missing character and repeating it.
   - This approach does not correctly identify a missing subsequence of length `n`.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The logic for checking the presence of all subsequences and constructing a missing subsequence is flawed. Therefore, the program will not produce correct results for all test cases.

### Correctness: **False**
