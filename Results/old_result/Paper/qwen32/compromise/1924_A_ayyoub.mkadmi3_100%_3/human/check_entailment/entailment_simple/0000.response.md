### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its logic to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in the given string `s`.
- If not, we need to provide one such string that does not appear as a subsequence.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes the string `s`, integers `k` and `n`.
   - It initializes `s1` and `s2` as empty strings and creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through each character in `s`. If the character is in `alphabet`, it removes the character from `alphabet` if `alphabet` has more than one element; otherwise, it adds the character to `s2` and resets `alphabet`.
   - It appends the character to `s1`.
   - After the loop, it calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - It returns a tuple:
     - A boolean indicating if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
     - A substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end.
     - The string `s2`.

3. **Post Function Call**:
   - If the boolean returned by `func_1` is `False`, it means not all possible strings of length `n` can be subsequences of `s`.
   - It then constructs a string that cannot be a subsequence by finding the smallest character not in `s1` and repeating it `n` times.
   - If the boolean is `True`, it means all possible strings of length `n` can be subsequences of `s`.

#### Issues in the Code:
- The function `func_1` does not correctly determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`. It only checks if `s1` has enough characters but does not verify the actual subsequences.
- The construction of the non-subsequence string is incorrect. It simply repeats the smallest missing character `n` times, which might not be a valid counterexample.
- The logic inside `func_1` does not align with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the logic and implementation of the function `func_1`, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

**Correctness: False**
