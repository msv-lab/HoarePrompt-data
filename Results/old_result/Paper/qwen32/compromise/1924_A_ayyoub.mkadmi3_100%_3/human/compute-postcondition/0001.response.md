The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `s2` as an empty string. This does not affect the values of the existing variables `s`, `k`, `n`, `m`, or `s1`. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, `m` is the length of `s` and satisfies 1 <= `m` <= 1000, `s1` is an empty string, `s2` is an empty string.**
