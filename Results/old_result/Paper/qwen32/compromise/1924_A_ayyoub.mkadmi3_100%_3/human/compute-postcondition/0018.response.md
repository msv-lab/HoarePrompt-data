The code snippet `s1 += i` appends the character `i` to the string `s1`. 

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `s1`, which now includes the character `i` appended to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, `m` is the length of `s` and satisfies 1 <= `m` <= 1000, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `i` is the next character in `s`. If `len(alphabet) != 1`, then `alphabet` excludes the character `i`. Otherwise, `s2` is a string that includes the character `i` appended to its previous value. `s1` is a string that includes the character `i` appended to its previous value.**
