The code calculates the length of `s1` (which is the string `s`) and divides it by `k` using integer division, assigning the result to `r`. This operation does not affect the values of `s1`, `s2`, or `alphabet`.

Given the initial state:
- `s1` is the string `s`.
- `s2` is the last character of `s`.
- `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

After executing the code:
- `r` is assigned the value `len(s1) // k`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`s1` is the string `s`; `s2` is the last character of `s`; `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `r` is `len(s) // k`.**
