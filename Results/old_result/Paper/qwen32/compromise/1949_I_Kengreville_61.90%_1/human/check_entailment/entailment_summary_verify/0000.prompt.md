You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef0 = [None] * n
    coef1 = [None] * n
    nodes = []
    for i in range(n):
        (x[i], y[i], r[i]) = map(int, input().split())

    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef0[i] = 0
            coef1[i] = 1
            nodes = []
            dfs(i)
            c0 = 0
            c1 = 0
            for j in nodes:
                c0 += coef0[j]
                c1 += coef1[j]
            ok = ok or c1 != 0
    if ok:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

#Function 2:
def dfs(i):
    if not visited[i]:
        visited[i] = True
        nodes.append(i)
        for j in range(n):
            dx = x[i] - x[j]
            dy = y[i] - y[j]
            if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
                coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
                coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
                dfs(j)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search starting from a specified disk index `i` to explore all disks that are part of the same connected component based on their positions and radii. It updates the `visited` list to mark these disks as visited, populates the `nodes` list with the indices of disks in the connected component, and modifies the `coef0` and `coef1` lists with calculated coefficients. The function modifies these lists in place and does not return any explicit values.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are the main problems:

1. **Global Variables**: The variables `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `n` are used in both `func_1` and `dfs`, but they are not passed as parameters to `dfs`. This makes the code dependent on global state, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the function is used in a different context or if there are multiple instances of the function running.

2. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function is defined but is not properly used within `func_1`. Specifically, the `dfs` function is called, but the results of the DFS (the `nodes` list and the `coef0` and `coef1` arrays) are not used to determine the feasibility of changing the radii as described in the problem statement.

3. **Logic for Checking Tangency and Radii**: The core logic for checking whether the radii can be adjusted to satisfy the conditions is missing. The code only checks if disks are tangent and assigns coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`), but it does not compute whether the sum of the radii can be strictly decreased while maintaining tangency.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The code does not handle several edge cases, such as:
   - When there is only one disk.
   - When all disks are tangent to each other in a complex configuration.
   - When disks are arranged in such a way that it is impossible to decrease the sum of the radii while maintaining tangency.

### Example of a Case Where the Code Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
3
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
```
This input represents three disks of radius 1 that are tangent to each other in a line. The code should output "NO" because it is impossible to decrease the radii while maintaining tangency. However, the provided code does not correctly handle this scenario and would likely output "YES" due to the incomplete logic.

### Correct Approach:
A correct solution would involve:
1. Identifying all pairs of disks that are tangent.
2. Setting up a system of equations or inequalities to ensure that the sum of the radii can be decreased while maintaining tangency.
3. Checking if the system of equations or inequalities has a solution.

Given the issues with the provided code, it is clear that it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
