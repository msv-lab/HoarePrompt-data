Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are the main problems:

1. **Global Variables**: The variables `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `n` are used in both `func_1` and `dfs`, but they are not passed as parameters to `dfs`. This makes the code dependent on global state, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the function is used in a different context or if there are multiple instances of the function running.

2. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function is defined but is not properly used within `func_1`. Specifically, the `dfs` function is called, but the results of the DFS (the `nodes` list and the `coef0` and `coef1` arrays) are not used to determine the feasibility of changing the radii as described in the problem statement.

3. **Logic for Checking Tangency and Radii**: The core logic for checking whether the radii can be adjusted to satisfy the conditions is missing. The code only checks if disks are tangent and assigns coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`), but it does not compute whether the sum of the radii can be strictly decreased while maintaining tangency.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The code does not handle several edge cases, such as:
   - When there is only one disk.
   - When all disks are tangent to each other in a complex configuration.
   - When disks are arranged in such a way that it is impossible to decrease the sum of the radii while maintaining tangency.

### Example of a Case Where the Code Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
3
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
```
This input represents three disks of radius 1 that are tangent to each other in a line. The code should output "NO" because it is impossible to decrease the radii while maintaining tangency. However, the provided code does not correctly handle this scenario and would likely output "YES" due to the incomplete logic.

### Correct Approach:
A correct solution would involve:
1. Identifying all pairs of disks that are tangent.
2. Setting up a system of equations or inequalities to ensure that the sum of the radii can be decreased while maintaining tangency.
3. Checking if the system of equations or inequalities has a solution.

Given the issues with the provided code, it is clear that it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
