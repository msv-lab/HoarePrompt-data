Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length n, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length n, `nodes` is a list that includes `i`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of length n, `n` must be greater than 0, `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`. If `visited[j]` is False and `(r[i] + r[j])`. `j` is now `j + 1`. `dy` is now `y[i] - y[j]`.**

In natural language: The value of `dy` has been updated to be `y[i] - y[j]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
