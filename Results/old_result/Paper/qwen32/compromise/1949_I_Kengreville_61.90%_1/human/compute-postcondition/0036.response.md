The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list where each `x[i]` is the first integer from the i-th input; `y` is a list where each `y[i]` is the second integer from the i-th input; `r` is a list where each `r[i]` is the third integer from the i-th input; `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n` except possibly `visited[0]` which is `True` if `visited[0]` was initially `False`; `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except possibly `coef0[0]` which is `0` if `visited[0]` was initially `False`; `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except possibly `coef1[0]` which is `1` if `visited[0]` was initially `False`; `nodes` is a list that is either empty or contains `[0]` if `visited[0]` was initially `False`; `i` is 1; `ok` is `False` unless `visited[0]` was initially `False`, in which case `ok` is `True`.**
