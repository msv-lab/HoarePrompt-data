The given code snippet modifies the variable `ok` based on the condition `c1 != 0`. The variable `ok` is initially `False` unless `visited[0]` was initially `False` and `dfs(i)` modified it. The variable `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`.

Given this, the new value of `ok` will be `True` if `c1` is not equal to `0`; otherwise, it will remain `False`.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list where each `x[i]` is the first integer from the i-th input; `y` is a list where each `y[i]` is the second integer from the i-th input; `r` is a list where each `r[i]` is the third integer from the i-th input; `visited` is a list of `False` values with `visited[1]` which is `True` and possibly `visited[0]` which is `True` if it was initially `False`; `coef0` is a list of `None` values with `coef0[1]` which may have been updated and possibly `coef0[0]` which is `0` if it was initially `False`; `coef1` is a list of `None` values with `coef1[1]` which may have been updated and possibly `coef1[0]` which is `1` if it was initially `False`; `nodes` is a list which may have elements added to it; `i` is 1; `ok` is `True` if `c1` is not equal to `0`, otherwise `False`; `c0` is the sum of `coef0[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`; `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`.**
