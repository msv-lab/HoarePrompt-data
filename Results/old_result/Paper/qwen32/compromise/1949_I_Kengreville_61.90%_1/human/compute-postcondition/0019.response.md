The code snippet provided updates the value of `dx` to be the difference between `x[i]` and `x[j]`. The other variables (`i`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `nodes`, `coef0`, `coef1`, `n`, `dy`) are not directly modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length n, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length n, `nodes` is a list that includes `i`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of length n, `n` must be greater than 0, `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`. If `visited[j]` is `False` and `(r[i] + r[j])`. `j` is `j + 1`.**
