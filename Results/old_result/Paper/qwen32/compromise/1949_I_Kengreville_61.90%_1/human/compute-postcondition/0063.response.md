The code snippet provided is `c0 += coef0[j]`. This implies that the value of `c0` is being incremented by the value of `coef0[j]`. The previous values of `c0` and `coef0[j]` are not specified, so we can only describe the change in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`c0` is increased by the value of `coef0[j]`.**
