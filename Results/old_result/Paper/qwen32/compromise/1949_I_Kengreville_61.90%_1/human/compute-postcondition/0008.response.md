The code snippet assigns the value of `-coef1[i]` to `coef1[j]`. This means that the value at index `j` of the list `coef1` is now the negative of the value at index `i` of the list `coef1`.

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length n, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length n, `nodes` is a list that includes `i`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of length n, `n` must be greater than 0, `dx` is x[i] - x[j], `dy` is y[i] - y[j], `visited[j]` is False, `coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, `coef1[j]` is -coef1[i]**.
