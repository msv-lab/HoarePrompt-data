The value of `c0` is incremented by the value of `coef0[j]`. The value of `j` is the next element in `nodes`, so `c0` will now hold its previous value plus `coef0[j]`. The values of `nodes` and `coef0` remain unchanged, and `j` still refers to the next element in `nodes`.

Output State: **`j` is the next element in `nodes`; `c0` is `c0` plus `coef0[j]`**.
