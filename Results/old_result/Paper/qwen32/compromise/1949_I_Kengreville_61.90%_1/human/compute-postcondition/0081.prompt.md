You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i], y[i] are the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk (-10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9), and r[i] is the radius of the i-th disk (1 <= r[i] <= 10^9). visited, coef0, and coef1 are lists of length n initialized with None. nodes is an initially empty list.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef0 = [None] * n
    coef1 = [None] * n
    nodes = []
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: `n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list where each `x[i]` is the first integer from the i-th input, `y` is a list where each `y[i]` is the second integer from the i-th input, `r` is a list where each `r[i]` is the third integer from the i-th input; `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`; `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `nodes` is an empty list; `i` is n-1.
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef0[i] = 0
            coef1[i] = 1
            nodes = []
            dfs(i)
            c0 = 0
            c1 = 0
            for j in nodes:
                c0 += coef0[j]
                c1 += coef1[j]
            ok = ok or c1 != 0
        
    #State: `n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list where each `x[i]` is the first integer from the i-th input; `y` is a list where each `y[i]` is the second integer from the i-th input; `r` is a list where each `r[i]` is the third integer from the i-th input; `visited` is a list of `True` values with length `n`; `coef0` is a list with each `coef0[i]` set to `0` or `None` if `visited[i]` was initially `True`; `coef1` is a list with each `coef1[i]` set to `1` or `None` if `visited[i]` was initially `True`; `nodes` is a list that is empty at the end of the loop; `i` is `n-1`; `ok` is `True` if at least one `c1` was not equal to `0` during the execution of the loop, otherwise `False`.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. It processes a predefined set of disks defined by their centers (x, y) and radii (r), ensuring that the number of disks (n) is between 1 and 1000. It uses additional lists (`visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`) initialized with `None` and an initially empty list `nodes`. The function returns no explicit value but likely modifies the `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` lists based on the disk data.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
