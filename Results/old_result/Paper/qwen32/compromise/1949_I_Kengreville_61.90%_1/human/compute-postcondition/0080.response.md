Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. It processes a predefined set of disks defined by their centers (x, y) and radii (r), ensuring that the number of disks (n) is between 1 and 1000. It uses additional lists (`visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`) initialized with `None` and an initially empty list `nodes`. The function returns no explicit value but likely modifies the `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` lists based on the disk data.**
