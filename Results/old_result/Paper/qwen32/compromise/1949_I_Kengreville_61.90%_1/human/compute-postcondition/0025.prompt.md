Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the total number of disks; `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length n containing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks respectively; `visited` is a list of boolean values of length n indicating whether a disk has been visited, and the current value of `visited[i]` is True; `nodes` is a list that will store the indices of disks that are part of the current connected component being explored and now includes `i`; `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of length n used to store coefficients during the DFS traversal.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    dx = x[i] - x[j]
    dy = y[i] - y[j]
    if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
        coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
        coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
        dfs(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length n, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length n, `nodes` is a list that includes `i`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of length n, `n` must be greater than 0, `dx` is x[i] - x[j], `dy` is y[i] - y[j]. If `visited[j]` is False and `(r[i] + r[j])

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length n, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length n, `nodes` is a list that includes `i`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of length n, `n` must be greater than 0, `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`. If `visited[j]` is `False` and `(r[i] + r[j])

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length n, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length n, `nodes` includes `i`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of length n, `n` is greater than 0, `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`. If `visited[j]` is `False` and `(r[i] + r[j])




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
