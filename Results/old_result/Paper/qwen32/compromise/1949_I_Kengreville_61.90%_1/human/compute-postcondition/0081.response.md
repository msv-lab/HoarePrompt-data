Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads the number of disks and their respective center coordinates and radii. It processes these disks to determine if there is at least one disk that can be part of a specific condition (indicated by `c1` not being zero). If such a disk exists, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not return any explicit value but modifies the `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` lists as part of its internal processing.**
