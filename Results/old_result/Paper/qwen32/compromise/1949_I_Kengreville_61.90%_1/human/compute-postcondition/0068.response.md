The only variable in the loop head is `j`, and it iterates over the elements in `nodes`. Therefore, the only state we can adjust for the next iteration is `j`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the current element in `nodes`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be updated to the next element in `nodes`.

State: **`j` is the next element in `nodes`**.

Note: The states of `c0` and `c1` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted in this context. They are updated within the loop body, which is omitted here.
