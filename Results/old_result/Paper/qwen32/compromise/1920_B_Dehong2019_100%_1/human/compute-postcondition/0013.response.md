The code snippet assigns the value of `ans1` to `ans2`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Since `ans1` is the sum of the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`, `ans2` will have the same value after the assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`; `ans2` is the sum of the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`.**
