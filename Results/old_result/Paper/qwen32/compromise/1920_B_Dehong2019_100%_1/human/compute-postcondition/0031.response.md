To determine what will be printed, let's break down the variables and the calculations step by step based on the given initial state.

### Initial State:
- `t` remains the same (its value is not specified, so we won't consider it further).
- `n`, `k`, `x` remain the same (their specific values are not provided, so we'll keep them as variables).
- `a` remains the same (it is a list of integers, and its specific values are not provided, so we'll keep it as a list).
- `ans1` is calculated as:
  \[
  \text{ans1} = \sum a - 2 \times \sum a[0:x] + \sum a[0:k] - 2 \times \sum a[x:x+k]
  \]
  Here:
  - \(\sum a\) is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
  - \(\sum a[0:x]\) is the sum of the first `x` elements in the list `a`.
  - \(\sum a[0:k]\) is the sum of the first `k` elements in the list `a`.
  - \(\sum a[x:x+k]\) is the sum of the elements from position `x` to `x + k - 1` in the list `a` (if these positions are within the bounds of the list).
- `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` observed during the iterations.

### Calculation of `ans1`:
The expression for `ans1` can be broken down as follows:
1. Calculate the sum of all elements in `a`.
2. Calculate the sum of the first `x` elements in `a`.
3. Calculate the sum of the first `k` elements in `a`.
4. Calculate the sum of elements from position `x` to `x + k - 1` in `a` (if these positions are within the bounds of the list).
5. Substitute these sums into the formula for `ans1`.

### Calculation of `ans2`:
`ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` observed during the iterations. Since the iterations are not described in detail, we assume that `ans2` holds the maximum value of `ans1` after all relevant iterations have been performed.

### Output:
Given the above calculations, the output of the `print(ans2)` statement will be the maximum value of `ans1` observed during the iterations.

Output: **ans2 (where ans2 is the maximum value of ans1 observed during the iterations)**
