To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1):`, so the variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:** This variable is the loop counter and will be automatically initialized to 0 before the loop starts. It will increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n - 1`. Therefore, there is no need to adjust `i` before the loop starts.

2. **Variable `n`:** This variable represents the number of cities, and it is a part of the range function that determines how many times the loop will execute. For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be at least 1, implying that `n` must be at least 2. The problem statement already specifies that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, so `n` is already in the correct range.

### Conclusion:
The only thing that needs to be ensured is that `n` is at least 2, which it already is according to the problem constraints. The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted as it is automatically handled by the loop.

State: **`cities` is a list of lists, where each sublist represents a test case and contains integers. The first integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) represents the number of cities, followed by `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities. The next integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) represents the number of queries, followed by `m` pairs of integers x_i, y_i (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i) representing the queries. `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros. `n` is at least 2.**
