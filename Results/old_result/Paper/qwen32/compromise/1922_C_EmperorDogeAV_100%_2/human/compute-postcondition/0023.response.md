The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between the city at the current index `i` and the city at the next index `i + 1` (forward), and assigns this difference to `prog_cities[i]`. 

Given the initial state, the conditions for `back` and `forward` are already established based on the value of `i`. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and `back` and `forward` are set accordingly. The only variable that gets updated by the code snippet is `prog_cities[i]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1. If `i` was greater than 0 before the increment, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `back` remains -99999999999999999999. If `i < n - 1`, `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `forward` remains 999999999999999999. `prog_cities[i]` is set to `abs(forward - cities[i])`.**
