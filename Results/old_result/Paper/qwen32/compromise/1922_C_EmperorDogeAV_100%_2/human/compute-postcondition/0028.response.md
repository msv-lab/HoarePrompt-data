To determine the output state, we need to execute the given Python code snippet based on the initial state provided.

Initial State: `i` is 3, `n` remains the same, `back` is -99999999999999999999, `forward` is 999999999999999999

Code Snippet:
```
back = cities[i - 1]
```

The code snippet is attempting to assign the value of `cities[i - 1]` to the variable `back`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression `i - 1` evaluates to 2. Therefore, `back` will be assigned the value at index 2 of the list `cities`.

Since the initial state does not provide any information about the contents of the list `cities`, we cannot determine the exact value that `back` will hold after the assignment. However, we know that `back` will no longer be -99999999999999999999 but will instead hold the value of `cities[2]`.

The values of `i`, `n`, and `forward` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` remains the same, `back` is `cities[2]`, `forward` is 999999999999999999**
