Functionality: **The function processes a list of city coordinates and returns a list where each element indicates whether the distance to the next city is smaller than the distance to the previous city. Specifically, for each city (except the first one), it checks if the distance to the next city is less than the distance to the previous city, and if so, it marks that position with `1`; otherwise, it records the distance to the next city.**
