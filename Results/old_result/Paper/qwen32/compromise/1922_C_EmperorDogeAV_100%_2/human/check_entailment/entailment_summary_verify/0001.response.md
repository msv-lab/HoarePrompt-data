### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code, especially focusing on the function `func_1` and its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine the minimum cost to travel between two cities on a number line.
- Each city has a uniquely closest city, and traveling to this closest city costs 1 coin.
- Traveling directly to any other city costs the absolute difference in their positions.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads:
     - The number of cities (`n`).
     - The positions of the cities (`cities`).
     - The number of queries (`m`).
     - The queries themselves.

2. **Determine Closest Cities:**
   - `forward_cities = func_1(cities, n)`: This function is supposed to calculate the cost to travel to the closest city for each city considering the forward direction.
   - `cities.reverse()`: The cities list is reversed.
   - `backward_cities = func_1(cities, n)`: The same function is called again but on the reversed list to calculate the cost to travel to the closest city for each city considering the backward direction.
   - The list is then reversed again to restore the original order.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are prefix sum arrays for the forward and backward costs, respectively.
   - These prefix sums are used to efficiently calculate the total cost of traveling through a sequence of closest cities.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query `(a, b)`, the program determines the direction of travel (forward or backward) based on the relative positions of `a` and `b`.
   - It then calculates the cost using the appropriate prefix sum array.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the cost to travel to the closest city for each city.
   - It iterates through the cities and compares the distances to the previous and next city.
   - If the next city is closer, it sets the cost to 1, otherwise, it sets the cost to the distance to the next city.

#### Issues and Corrections:

The function `func_1` is intended to determine whether the next city is closer than the previous city for each city, and if so, it should mark that position with `1`. However, the current implementation is incorrect because it does not handle the logic correctly:

- The function should set the cost to `1` if the next city is closer.
- If the previous city is closer, the cost should also be `1` because the problem guarantees a unique closest city.

Here's the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = cities[i - 1] if i > 0 else float('-inf')
        forward = cities[i + 1]
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) <= abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = 1
    return prog_cities
```

However, the above correction is still incorrect because the logic should be simplified to always set the cost to `1` if the next city is closer, and handle the edge cases correctly. The correct simplified version should be:

```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - cities[i - 1]):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = 1
    prog_cities[0] = 1  # The first city's closest city is always the next one
    prog_cities[n - 2] = 1  # The last city's closest city is always the previous one
    return prog_cities
```

This simplifies to:

```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [1] * (n - 1)
    return prog_cities
```

This is because the problem guarantees a unique closest city, and thus, the cost to travel to the closest city is always `1` for each city (except the first and last city which have only one possible closest city).

#### Conclusion:

The original function `func_1` is incorrect as it does not properly determine the cost to travel to the closest city. The corrected function should always return `1` for each city (except the first and last city which have only one possible closest city). However, given the problem constraints, the cost to travel to the closest city is always `1` for each city.

Therefore, the original assessment was correct in identifying the issue with `func_1`, and the program needs to be corrected accordingly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
