You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of lists, where each sublist represents a test case and contains integers. The first integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) represents the number of cities, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities. The next integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) represents the number of queries, followed by m pairs of integers x_i, y_i (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i) representing the queries. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

All other variables remain unchanged.
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns the list `prog_cities` which contains `n - 1` elements where each element at index `i` is `1` if the absolute difference between `cities[i + 1]` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `cities[i - 1]` (for `i > 0`), otherwise it is the absolute difference between `cities[i + 1]` and `cities[i]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of city coordinates and returns a list where each element indicates whether the distance to the next city is smaller than the distance to the previous city. Specifically, for each city (except the first one), it checks if the distance to the next city is less than the distance to the previous city, and if so, it marks that position with `1`; otherwise, it records the distance to the next city.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle the problem description and does not produce the correct output for all cases. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the closest city for each city in the list. However, the logic for determining the closest city is flawed. Specifically, the function is supposed to return the distance to the closest city, but it incorrectly returns `1` when the forward city is closer, which is not what the problem description requires. The problem description specifies that the closest city is the one with the smallest distance, not `1`.

2. **Incorrect Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The prefix sum arrays `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are intended to store cumulative costs to travel through the cities. However, because `func_1` returns incorrect values, the prefix sums are also incorrect, leading to incorrect final results for the queries.

3. **Handling of Queries**:
   - The program calculates the cost for each query by subtracting prefix sums. However, since the prefix sums are incorrect due to the flawed `func_1`, the cost calculations for the queries are also incorrect.

To illustrate the problem, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

**Actual Output (from the given program):**
The program will not produce the expected output due to the incorrect logic in `func_1`.

To fix the program, the `func_1` function should be corrected to return the actual distance to the closest city, and the prefix sum calculations should be adjusted accordingly. Here is a corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = float('inf')
        forward = float('inf')
        if i > 0:
            back = abs(cities[i] - cities[i - 1])
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i])
        prog_cities[i] = min(back, forward)
    return prog_cities
```

With this correction, the program should be able to produce the correct output for the given problem description.
