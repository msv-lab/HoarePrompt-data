Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle the problem description and does not produce the correct output for all cases. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the closest city for each city in the list. However, the logic for determining the closest city is flawed. Specifically, the function is supposed to return the distance to the closest city, but it incorrectly returns `1` when the forward city is closer, which is not what the problem description requires. The problem description specifies that the closest city is the one with the smallest distance, not `1`.

2. **Incorrect Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The prefix sum arrays `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are intended to store cumulative costs to travel through the cities. However, because `func_1` returns incorrect values, the prefix sums are also incorrect, leading to incorrect final results for the queries.

3. **Handling of Queries**:
   - The program calculates the cost for each query by subtracting prefix sums. However, since the prefix sums are incorrect due to the flawed `func_1`, the cost calculations for the queries are also incorrect.

To illustrate the problem, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

**Actual Output (from the given program):**
The program will not produce the expected output due to the incorrect logic in `func_1`.

To fix the program, the `func_1` function should be corrected to return the actual distance to the closest city, and the prefix sum calculations should be adjusted accordingly. Here is a corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = float('inf')
        forward = float('inf')
        if i > 0:
            back = abs(cities[i] - cities[i - 1])
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i])
        prog_cities[i] = min(back, forward)
    return prog_cities
```

With this correction, the program should be able to produce the correct output for the given problem description.
