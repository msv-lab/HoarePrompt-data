You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap
The task involves determining the minimum number of coins needed to travel between two cities on a number line. Cities are connected in such a way that each city has a uniquely closest city, and traveling to the closest city costs 1 coin. Traveling directly to any other city costs the absolute difference in their positions.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities (`n`), their positions (`cities`), the number of queries (`m`), and the queries themselves.

2. **Determine Closest Cities**:
   - `forward_cities = func_1(cities, n)`: This function calculates the cost to travel to the closest city for each city considering the forward direction.
   - `cities.reverse()`: The cities list is reversed.
   - `backward_cities = func_1(cities, n)`: The same function is called again but on the reversed list to calculate the cost to travel to the closest city for each city considering the backward direction.
   - The list is then reversed again to restore the original order.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are prefix sum arrays for the forward and backward costs, respectively.
   - These prefix sums are used to efficiently calculate the total cost of traveling through a sequence of closest cities.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query `(a, b)`, the program determines the direction of travel (forward or backward) based on the relative positions of `a` and `b`.
   - It then calculates the cost using the appropriate prefix sum array.

5. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the cost to travel to the closest city for each city.
   - It iterates through the cities and compares the distances to the previous and next city.
   - If the next city is closer, it sets the cost to 1, otherwise, it sets the cost to the distance to the next city.

### Issues and Corrections
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function is supposed to determine the cost to travel to the closest city. However, it incorrectly sets the cost to the distance to the next city if it is not closer than the previous city.
   - The correct logic should be to set the cost to 1 if the next city is closer, otherwise, it should set the cost to 1 if the previous city is closer. Since the problem guarantees a unique closest city, the logic should be simplified to always set the cost to 1 if the next city is closer, and handle the edge cases correctly.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The prefix sums are calculated based on the assumption that traveling through the closest cities always costs 1 coin. This is correct given the problem constraints.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - The query processing logic is correct, as it uses the prefix sums to calculate the total cost efficiently.

### Corrected Function `func_1`
Here's the corrected version of `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        back = cities[i - 1]
        forward = cities[i + 1]
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = 1
    prog_cities[0] = 1  # The first city's closest city is always the next one
    prog_cities[n - 2] = 1  # The last city's closest city is always the previous one
    return prog_cities
```

### Conclusion
The original program has a logical error in the `func_1` function. After correcting this function, the program should work as intended.

Correctness: **False**
