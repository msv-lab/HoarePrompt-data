### Reasoning:

The program is intended to determine the minimum number of coins required to travel between pairs of cities based on the given rules. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program and the logic it employs:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - It reads the number of cities `n` and their coordinates.
     - It reads the number of queries `m` and the pairs of cities for each query.

2. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to determine the closest city for each city in the list. 
   - For each city, it calculates the distance to the next city (`forward`) and the previous city (`back`).
   - It then determines if the closest city is the next city (`forward`) or the previous city (`back`). If the next city is closer, it assigns `1` to `prog_cities[i]`; otherwise, it assigns the distance to the next city.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for both forward and backward closest city distances.
   - `pref_sum_f` is the prefix sum for the forward distances.
   - `pref_sum_b` is the prefix sum for the backward distances, reversed to match the original city order.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program determines the direction of travel (forward or backward).
   - It then calculates the total number of coins required using the prefix sums.

### Issues and Corrections:
1. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the closest city for each city, but it incorrectly calculates the distance to the next city and assigns `1` if the next city is closer. This is incorrect because the problem states that traveling to the closest city costs `1` coin, not the distance itself.
   - The function should assign `1` if the next city is closer, and `1` if the previous city is closer, but it should not assign the distance itself. The distances should be used to determine the closest city, not stored in `prog_cities`.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The prefix sums are calculated based on the incorrect values in `prog_cities`. Since `prog_cities` contains incorrect values, the prefix sums will also be incorrect.
   - The prefix sums should be calculated based on the correct closest city distances.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - The query processing logic is correct in terms of determining the direction of travel and using the prefix sums, but the prefix sums themselves are incorrect due to the incorrect values in `prog_cities`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the incorrect implementation of the `func_1` function, which leads to incorrect prefix sums and, consequently, incorrect results for the queries.

**Correctness: False**
