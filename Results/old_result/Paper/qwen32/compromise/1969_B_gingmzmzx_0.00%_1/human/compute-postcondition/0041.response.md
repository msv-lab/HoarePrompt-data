Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a new list of integers (0s and 1s) from the input and must have at least one element, `n` is greater than 1, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the current list `s`, `cnt` is either `[1, 1]` if `c` is 0 or `[0, 1]` if `c` is 1, `c` is the next element in the list `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated by adding `zeroes - cnt[0]`.**
