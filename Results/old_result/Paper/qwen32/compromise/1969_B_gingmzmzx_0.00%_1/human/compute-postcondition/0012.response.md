Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) with at least one element, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is [1, 0] if `c` is 0, otherwise `cnt` is [0, 1], and `ans` is 0 if `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`.**
