In the given task, the for loop iterates `n` times, as specified by the range in the loop header. The variables in the loop head are `_` (which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use) and `n`.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to focus on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if and only if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `_` does not affect the execution of the loop.

Given the initial state where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and `s` is a binary string for each test case, these variables are not directly related to the execution of the loop. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

The only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a binary string for each test case, and `n` must be greater than 0**.
