The code snippet initializes the variable `cnt` to `[0, 0]`. This means the values of `cnt[0]` and `cnt[1]` are both set to 0. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a new list of integers (0s and 1s) from the input, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in `s`, `cnt` is [0, 0], `ans` needs recalculating.**
