The value of `ans` is updated by adding the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]`. Given that `cnt` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`, `cnt[0]` will be either 1 or 0. Therefore, `ans` will be incremented by `zeroes - 1` if `cnt` is `[1, 0]`, or by `zeroes` if `cnt` is `[0, 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) with at least one element, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is either [1, 0] or [0, 1] depending on the value of `c`, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`, and `c` is not equal to 0.**
