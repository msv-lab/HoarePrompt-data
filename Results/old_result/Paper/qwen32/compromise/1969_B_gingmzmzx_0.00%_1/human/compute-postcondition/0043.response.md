The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the count of the element `c` in the dictionary `cnt`. Given that `c` is the next element in the list `s`, the count associated with `c` in the dictionary `cnt` will increase by 1.

Output State: **`c` is the next element in the list `s`; `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1.**
