To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in the function `func_1()` correctly computes the minimum total cost to make each binary string `s` sorted in non-descending order using the specified operations.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function starts by reading an integer `n`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers (0s and 1s).

2. **Counting Zeroes:**
   - It counts the total number of '0's in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `zeroes`.

3. **Tracking Counts:**
   - It initializes a list `cnt` with two elements, both set to 0. This list will be used to keep track of the count of '0's and '1's encountered so far as we iterate through the string.
   - It also initializes a variable `ans` to 0, which will store the computed answer (minimum cost) for the current test case.

4. **Iterating Through the String:**
   - For each character `c` in the string `s`, it updates the count of the corresponding digit in `cnt`.
   - If the character `c` is '0', it checks if there have been any '1's encountered so far (`cnt[1] > 0`). If yes, it increments `ans` by 1. This is because a '0' after a '1' needs to be shifted to the left, and the cost of this operation is 1.
   - If the character `c` is '1', it adds the number of remaining '0's to `ans`. This is because each '1' needs to be shifted past all the remaining '0's to the right, and the cost of shifting a substring of length `k` is `k`.

5. **Printing the Result:**
   - After processing each string `s`, it prints the computed `ans` for that test case.

### Verification Against the Example

Let's verify the function against the example provided in the problem statement:

1. **Test Case 1: "10"**
   - `zeroes = 1`
   - Iteration:
     - `c = 1`: `cnt = [0, 1]`, `ans = 0`
     - `c = 0`: `cnt = [1, 1]`, `ans = 1` (since `cnt[1] > 0`)
   - Output: `1` (However, the expected output is `2` as per the example. This suggests that the logic might not be correct.)

2. **Test Case 2: "0000"**
   - `zeroes = 4`
   - Iteration:
     - All characters are '0', so no cost is added.
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3: "11000"**
   - `zeroes = 3`
   - Iteration:
     - `c = 1`: `cnt = [0, 1]`, `ans = 0`
     - `c = 1`: `cnt = [0, 2]`, `ans = 0`
     - `c = 0`: `cnt = [1, 2]`, `ans = 2`
     - `c = 0`: `cnt = [2, 2]`, `ans = 4`
     - `c = 0`: `cnt = [3, 2]`, `ans = 6`
   - Output: `6` (However, the expected output is `9` as per the example. This suggests that the logic might not be correct.)

4. **Test Case 4: "101011"**
   - `zeroes = 2`
   - Iteration:
     - `c = 1`: `cnt = [0, 1]`, `ans = 0`
     - `c = 0`: `cnt = [1, 1]`, `ans = 1`
     - `c = 1`: `cnt = [1, 2]`, `ans = 1`
     - `c = 0`: `cnt = [2, 2]`, `ans = 3`
     - `c = 1`: `cnt = [2, 3]`, `ans = 3`
     - `c = 1`: `cnt = [2, 4]`, `ans = 3`
   - Output: `3` (However, the expected output is `5` as per the example. This suggests that the logic might not be correct.)

5. **Test Case 5: "01101001"**
   - `zeroes = 4`
   - Iteration:
     - `c = 0`: `cnt = [1, 0]`, `ans = 0`
     - `c = 1`: `cnt = [1, 1]`, `ans = 0`
     - `c = 1`: `cnt = [1, 2]`, `ans = 0`
     - `c = 0`: `cnt = [2, 2]`, `ans = 2`
     - `c = 1`: `cnt = [2, 3]`, `ans = 2`
     - `c = 0`: `cnt = [3, 3]`, `ans = 5`
     - `c = 0`: `cnt = [4, 3]`, `ans = 8`
     - `c = 1`: `cnt = [4, 4]`, `ans = 8`
   - Output: `8` (However, the expected output is `11` as per the example. This suggests that the logic might not be correct.)

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and verification against the example test cases, the logic implemented in the function `func_1()` does not correctly compute the minimum total cost to make each binary string `s` sorted in non-descending order.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
