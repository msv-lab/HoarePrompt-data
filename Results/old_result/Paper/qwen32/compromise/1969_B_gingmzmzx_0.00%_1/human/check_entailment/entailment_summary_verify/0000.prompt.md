You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and computes a value `ans` based on the counts of '0's and '1's in the string. It then prints the computed `ans` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to cyclically shift substrings of a binary string `s` to sort it in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s followed by all 1s).
- The cost of shifting a substring `s_l ... s_r` is `r - l + 1`.
- We need to minimize the total cost to achieve the sorted string.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string using a specific approach:
1. It counts the number of zeros in the string.
2. It iterates through the string and keeps track of the count of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
3. For each character, it updates the cost based on whether the character is 0 or 1.

Let's break down the logic:
- If the current character is 0, it adds 1 to the cost if there have been any 1s encountered so far (`cnt[1] > 0`).
- If the current character is 1, it adds the remaining number of zeros (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to the cost.

### Correctness Check:
To verify the correctness, we need to ensure that this approach accurately computes the minimum cost to sort the string for all possible inputs.

#### Example Test Cases:
1. **Input:** `10`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Explanation: Shift the entire string `10 -> 01` with cost `2`.

2. **Input:** `0000`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Explanation: Already sorted.

3. **Input:** `11000`
   - Expected Output: `9`
   - Explanation: Multiple shifts required to move all 0s to the front.

4. **Input:** `101011`
   - Expected Output: `5`
   - Explanation: Multiple shifts required to move all 0s to the front.

5. **Input:** `01101001`
   - Expected Output: `11`
   - Explanation: Multiple shifts required to move all 0s to the front.

Let's check if the program handles these cases correctly:

- For `10`, the program will output `2` because the first character is `1` and the second character is `0`, so it adds `1` (since there was a `1` before) and `1` (since there is one `0` left).
- For `0000`, the program will output `0` because there are no `1`s to consider.
- For `11000`, the program will output `9` because it correctly accounts for the cost of moving all 0s to the front.
- For `101011`, the program will output `5` because it correctly accounts for the cost of moving all 0s to the front.
- For `01101001`, the program will output `11` because it correctly accounts for the cost of moving all 0s to the front.

After analyzing the provided program and the example test cases, it seems that the program correctly computes the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the described logic.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program appears to be correct for all provided test cases and seems to handle the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **True**.
