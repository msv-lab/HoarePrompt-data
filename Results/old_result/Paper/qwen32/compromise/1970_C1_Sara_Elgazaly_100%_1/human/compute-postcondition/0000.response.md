The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by `n-1` edges, and there is exactly one starting node provided in the last line. The new variables `x` and `y` are introduced and assigned values from the input, so they are not part of the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, `t` is an integer equal to 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 <= u_i <= n, representing the starting node for each round. Since t=1, there is only one starting node. `x` and `y` are integers read from the input.**
