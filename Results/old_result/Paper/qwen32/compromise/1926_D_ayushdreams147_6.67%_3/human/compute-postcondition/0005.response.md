Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer representing the number of elements in the list `a`, and `a`, which is a list of `n` integers. Each integer in `a` is within the range 0 to 2^31 - 1. The function returns `res`, which is the count of unique numbers in the list `a` after considering each number and its bitwise flipped version.**
