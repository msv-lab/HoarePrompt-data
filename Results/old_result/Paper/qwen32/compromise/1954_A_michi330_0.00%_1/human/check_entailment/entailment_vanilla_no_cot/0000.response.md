To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic against the problem requirements.

The problem states that Alice wants to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color by repainting at most `k` parts. 

The key points to consider are:
1. If `n <= k`, Bob can simply repaint all parts to the same color, so the answer is "NO".
2. If `m = 1`, there is only one color available, so Bob can always repaint the ribbon to have all parts the same color, so the answer is "NO".
3. Otherwise, Alice can try to distribute the colors in such a way that no color appears more than `n - k` times. If such a distribution is possible, Bob won't be able to repaint all parts to the same color with at most `k` repainting operations. This can be checked by ensuring that `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k`.

Let's break down the provided program logic:
- The program correctly checks if `n <= k` and prints "NO" in that case.
- The program also checks if `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` and prints "NO" in that case.
- If neither condition is met, it prints "YES", indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

The logic in the program is consistent with the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
