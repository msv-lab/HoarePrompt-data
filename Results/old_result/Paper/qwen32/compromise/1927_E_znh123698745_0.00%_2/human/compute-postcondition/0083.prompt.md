You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and k is even. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        array = list(range(1, n + 1))
        
        answer = [1]
        
        a = [1, -1]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if (-1) ** i == -1:
                answer.append(array[a[-1]])
                a[-1] -= 1
            else:
                answer.append(array[a[0]])
                a[0] += 1
        
        print(*answer)
        
    #State: The output state is a sequence of `answer` lists for each test case, where each `answer` list is constructed by starting with 1 and then alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements of `array` until all elements are included. For each test case, if `n` is odd, the `answer` list is `[1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., n//2, n//2 + 1]`. If `n` is even, the `answer` list is `[1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., n//2 + 1, n//2]`. Each `answer` list is printed on a new line.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`. The function returns the result for each test case based on the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
