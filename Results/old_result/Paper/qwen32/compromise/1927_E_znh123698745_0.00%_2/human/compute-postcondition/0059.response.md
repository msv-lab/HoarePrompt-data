The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the `range(1, n)` will generate at least one value (1) if `n` is greater than 1. The initial value of `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because `i` is initialized in the `range` function of the loop head.

The other variables (`k`, `a`, `array`, and `answer`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted based on the loop's execution condition.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1**
