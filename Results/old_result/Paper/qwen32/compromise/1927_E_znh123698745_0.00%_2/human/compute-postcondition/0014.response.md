The code snippet `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` attempts to append the element at the index specified by the last element of `a` to the `answer` list. However, in the initial state, there is no mention of a list `a`. Assuming `a` is a typo and should be `array`, the code would append the element at the index specified by the last element of `array` to the `answer` list.

Given that `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, and `i` is `n-1`, the last element of `array` would be `n`. Therefore, `array[a[-1]]` would be `array[n]`. However, since list indices in Python are 0-based, `array[n]` would actually be out of bounds and would raise an `IndexError`.

Since the problem statement does not specify the existence of `a` and assuming `a` is a typo, let's assume the intention was to use `i` instead, which is `n-1`. Thus, `array[i]` would be `array[n-1]`, which is `n`.

Therefore, `answer` will have `n` appended to it.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is `n-1`, `answer` contains the integer `n`.**
