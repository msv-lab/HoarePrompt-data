Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `answer` is a list containing the integer 1, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1, and `(-1) ** i == -1`. The current value of `i` is such that `(-1) ** i` equals -1.**
