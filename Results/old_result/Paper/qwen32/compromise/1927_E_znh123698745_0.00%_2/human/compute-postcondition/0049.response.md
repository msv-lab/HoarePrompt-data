The code snippet provided is `answer.append(array[a[0]])`. This line of code appends the element at index `a[0]` of the `array` to the `answer` list. Therefore, the `answer` list will have a new element added to it.

Given the initial state, `t` is a positive integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 5, and `k` is the second input integer. Additionally, `i` is 5. The value of `a[0]` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value that will be appended to `answer`. However, we know that `answer` will have one more element than it did before the execution of this line.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 5, `k` is the second input integer, `i` is 5, `answer` has one more element appended from `array[a[0]]`.**
