The code snippet `array = list(range(1, n + 1))` reassigns the variable `array` to a new list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `answer`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `answer` is a list containing the integers in the order [1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., m], where m is the middle element if `n` is odd, and `a` is a list containing the integers [n, -n]**.
