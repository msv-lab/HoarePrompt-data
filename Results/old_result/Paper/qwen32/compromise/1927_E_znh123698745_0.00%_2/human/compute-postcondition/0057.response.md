Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is [n//2 + 1, -n//2 - 1] if n is even, or [n//2 + 1, -n//2 - 2] if n is odd, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to n, `answer` is [1]**.

The value of `answer` has been initialized to `[1]`. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `array` remain unchanged.
