The code snippet `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of the list `array` by 1. Given the initial state, `array` contains integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, and `i` is `n-1`, the last element of `array` is `n`. After decrementing `n` by 1, the last element of `array` becomes `n-1`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n-1` inclusive followed by `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `answer` contains the integer `n`.**
