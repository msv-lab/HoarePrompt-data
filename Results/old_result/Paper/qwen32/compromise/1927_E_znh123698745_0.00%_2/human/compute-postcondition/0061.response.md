The code snippet provided is `answer.append(array[a[-1]])`. This line appends the element from `array` at the index specified by the last element of `a` to the `answer` list. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is an odd integer, making `(-1)` (this part seems to be a typo or incomplete statement, but it does not affect the execution of the given line of code).

The code does not modify `n` or `i`, and it does not provide any information about the contents of `array` or `a`. Therefore, we can only describe the change to `answer`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is an odd integer, `answer` has an additional element which is `array[a[-1]]`.**
