Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`. If `(-1) ** i` equals -1, then `answer` has an additional element which is `array[a[-1]]`, and the last element of `a` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `answer` has an additional element which is `array[a[0] - 1]`, and `a[0]` is incremented by 1.**
