### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the logic of the program and compare it with the problem requirements and the provided function summary to determine if the program is correct or not.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to a given integer `n`.
- The sum `n` is the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet (1 for 'a', 2 for 'b', ..., 26 for 'z').

#### Program Logic Breakdown:
1. **For `n > 52`:**
   - The word is constructed as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
   - This means the first letter is `n - 53` positions from 'a', and the last two letters are 'z'.

2. **For `28 < n <= 52`:**
   - The word is constructed as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
   - This means the first letter is 'a', the second letter is `n - 28` positions from 'a', and the last letter is 'z'.

3. **For `n == 27`:**
   - The word is `'aay'`.

4. **For `n <= 27`:**
   - The word is constructed as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.
   - This means the first two letters are 'a', and the last letter is `n - 3` positions from 'a'.

#### Verification Against Test Cases:

1. **Input:** `24`
   - `n = 24`
   - Since `24 <= 27`, the word is `'aa' + alphabet[24 - 3]` = `'aa' + 'r'` = `'aar'`.
   - The correct output should be `'aav'` because `'aav'` is lexicographically smaller than `'aar'`.
   - **Error** in the program.

2. **Input:** `70`
   - `n = 70`
   - Since `70 > 52`, the word is `alphabet[70 - 53] + 'zz'` = `alphabet[17] + 'zz'` = `'rzz'`.
   - This is correct.

3. **Input:** `3`
   - `n = 3`
   - Since `3 <= 27`, the word is `'aa' + alphabet[3 - 3]` = `'aa' + 'a'` = `'aaa'`.
   - This is correct.

4. **Input:** `55`
   - `n = 55`
   - Since `55 > 52`, the word is `alphabet[55 - 53] + 'zz'` = `alphabet[2] + 'zz'` = `'bzz'`.
   - The correct output should be `'czz'` because `'czz'` is lexicographically smaller than `'bzz'`.
   - **Error** in the program.

5. **Input:** `48`
   - `n = 48`
   - Since `48 > 52` is false and `48 > 27` is true, the word is `'a' + alphabet[48 - 28] + 'z'` = `'a' + alphabet[20] + 'z'` = `'atzz'`.
   - The correct output should be `'auz'` because `'auz'` is lexicographically smaller than `'atzz'`.
   - **Error** in the program.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word for certain values of `n`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
