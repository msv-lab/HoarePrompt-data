Let's carefully analyze the provided program and function summary against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that could have been encoded to a given integer \( n \).
- \( n \) is the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet (where 'a' = 1, 'b' = 2, ..., 'z' = 26).

### Program Analysis:
The program uses specific conditions to determine the 3-letter word based on the value of \( n \):

1. **Case 1: \( n > 52 \)**
   - Constructs the word as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
   - This means the first letter is the one corresponding to the position \( n - 53 \), and the last two letters are 'z'.
   - **Reasoning:** This is correct because if \( n \) is greater than 52, the sum of the positions of three letters can be maximized by having two 'z's (position 26) and one other letter. The value \( n - 53 \) ensures the first letter is valid (since \( n - 53 \geq 1 \)).

2. **Case 2: \( 27 \leq n \leq 52 \)**
   - Constructs the word as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
   - This means the first letter is 'a', the second letter is the one corresponding to the position \( n - 28 \), and the last letter is 'z'.
   - **Reasoning:** This is correct because if \( n \) is between 27 and 52, the smallest possible word can be constructed by having 'a' as the first letter, and the other two letters chosen such that their sum with 'a' equals \( n \). The value \( n - 28 \) ensures the second letter is valid (since \( n - 28 \geq 1 \)).

3. **Case 3: \( n = 27 \)**
   - Constructs the word as `'aay'`.
   - **Reasoning:** This is correct because the smallest possible word with a sum of 27 is 'aay' (1 + 1 + 25).

4. **Case 4: \( 3 \leq n \leq 26 \)**
   - Constructs the word as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.
   - This means the first two letters are 'a', and the last letter is the one corresponding to the position \( n - 3 \).
   - **Reasoning:** This is correct because if \( n \) is between 3 and 26, the smallest possible word can be constructed by having 'aa' as the first two letters, and the last letter chosen such that their sum equals \( n \). The value \( n - 3 \) ensures the last letter is valid (since \( n - 3 \geq 1 \)).

### Testing the Program:
Let's verify the program with a few cases:

1. **Input: 24**
   - Expected output: `'aav'` (1 + 1 + 22)
   - Program output: `'aav'` (Correct)

2. **Input: 70**
   - Expected output: `'rzz'` (18 + 26 + 26)
   - Program output: `'rzz'` (Correct)

3. **Input: 3**
   - Expected output: `'aaa'` (1 + 1 + 1)
   - Program output: `'aaa'` (Correct)

4. **Input: 55**
   - Expected output: `'czz'` (3 + 26 + 26)
   - Program output: `'czz'` (Correct)

5. **Input: 48**
   - Expected output: `'auz'` (1 + 21 + 26)
   - Program output: `'auz'` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases within the given constraints and produces the lexicographically smallest word for each input \( n \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
