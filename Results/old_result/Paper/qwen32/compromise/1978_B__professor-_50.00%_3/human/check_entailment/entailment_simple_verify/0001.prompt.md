You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob has `n` buns to sell at a usual price `a` or at a modified price for the first `k` buns, where the price of the `i-th` bun is `(b - i + 1)`. The goal is to maximize the profit.

### Key Points:
1. **No Promotion (k=0):** Selling all buns at the usual price `a` results in a profit of `n * a`.
2. **Full Promotion (k=n):** Selling all buns at the modified price results in a profit of the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - (n-1) + 1`.
3. **Partial Promotion (0 < k < n):** Selling the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price.

### Program Analysis:
The program handles three cases:
1. **Case 1:** `b <= a` - Selling all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price is not beneficial.
2. **Case 2:** `b - a >= n` - Selling all buns at the modified price because the difference between the modified and usual price is large enough to justify the promotion for all buns.
3. **Case 3:** `b - a < n` - This case seems to be incorrectly handled. The program calculates the profit assuming a full promotion and then adds the profit from selling the remaining buns at the usual price, which does not necessarily maximize the profit.

### Correctness of the Program:
The program does not correctly handle the case where `b - a < n`. The optimal `k` is not necessarily `n` or `0`, but could be any value between `0` and `n` that maximizes the profit.

### Correct Approach:
To find the optimal `k`, we need to compare the profit for different values of `k` and choose the one that maximizes the profit. However, a more efficient approach is to use the fact that the profit function is a quadratic function of `k` and can be maximized by finding the vertex of the parabola or by checking the boundary values.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly handle all cases, especially when `b - a < n`. It does not find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
