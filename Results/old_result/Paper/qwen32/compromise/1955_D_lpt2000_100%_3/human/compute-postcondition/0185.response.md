Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists `a` and `b`. The integer `n` represents the length of list `a`, `m` represents the length of list `b`, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n. Each element in list `a` and `b` is an integer within the range [1, 10^6]. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
