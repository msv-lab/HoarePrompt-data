Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`; `E` contains the elements from the first `m` elements of `aa` that were not part of `D`; `C` contains the elements from `bb` that were not part of `D`; `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`; `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0; The loop will execute again if `nabors` is greater than 0; `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input; `aa` is a list of strings derived from the input; `bb` is a list of strings derived from the input; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of the elements in `bb`.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            pairs_in_D -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        D[in_aa] += 1
        pairs_in_D += 1
        C[in_aa] -= 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `aa` must have at least `max(m, n - m)` elements, `m` must be less than `n`. If `D[out_aa]` was initially greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1 and remains greater than 0, and `D[out_aa]` is unchanged. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 (and is greater than or equal to 0), `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, and `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1 while `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, then `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1 and `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, and `pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1. If `C[in_aa]` is 0, then `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `aa` must have at least `max(m, n - m)` elements, `m` must be less than `n`, `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`. If `D[out_aa] > 0`, then if `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa] <= 0`, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `C[in_aa] > 0`, then `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D >= k`; otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `aa` must have at least `max(m, n - m)` elements, `m` must be less than `n`, `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, and if `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, then `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `C[in_aa]` is not greater than 0, then `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1. `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
