The code snippet decreases the value of `pairs_in_D` by 1. The values of `in_aa`, `out_aa`, and `D[out_aa]` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code.

Output State: **`in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1.**
