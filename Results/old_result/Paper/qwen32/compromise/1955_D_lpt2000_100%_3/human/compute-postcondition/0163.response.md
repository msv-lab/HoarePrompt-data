Output State: **`aa` must have at least `max(m, n - m)` elements, `m` must be less than `n`, `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`. If `D[out_aa] > 0`, then if `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa] <= 0`, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. `pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1.`**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that `pairs_in_D` has been incremented by 1. All other conditions and variable relationships remain unchanged.
