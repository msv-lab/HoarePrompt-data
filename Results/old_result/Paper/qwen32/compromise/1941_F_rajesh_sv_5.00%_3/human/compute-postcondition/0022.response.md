The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is -inf, `k` is -inf, `A` is initialized, `D` is -inf, `F` is -inf, `max_diff` is updated to `A[2] - A[1]` if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, otherwise `max_diff` remains unchanged, `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, `index` is set to 2 if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, otherwise `index` remains `None`, `i` is 3, `diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`**
