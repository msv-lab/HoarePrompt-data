Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is -inf, `k` is -inf, `A` is initialized, `D` is -inf, `F` is -inf, `max_diff` is `A[3] - A[2]` if `diff > A[2] - A[1]`, otherwise `max_diff` remains `A[2] - A[1]`, `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff > next_max_diff`, `index` is 3 if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise `index` remains `None` if `diff` is not greater than `max_diff`, `i` is 3, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`.**
