Postcondition: **`max_diff` is 2, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in A, `index` is the index of the larger element in the pair that gives the largest difference, `A` is [1, 3, 5, 7], `D` is [1, 3, 5, 7], `F` must contain at least two elements, `left` is 1, `right` is 3, `ans` is 2, `h` must be greater than 0, `mid` is `h // 2`, `mid_sum` is `5 + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `7 + f`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is `(h // 2) + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is `mid` and `l` is 0.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes, taking into account the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` and the corresponding updates to `l` and `h`.
