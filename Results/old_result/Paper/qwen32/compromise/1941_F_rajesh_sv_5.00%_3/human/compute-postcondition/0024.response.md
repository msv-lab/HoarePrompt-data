The code snippet `max_diff = diff` updates the value of `max_diff` to the current value of `diff`. Therefore, `max_diff` will now hold the value of `A[3] - A[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is -inf, `k` is -inf, `A` is initialized, `D` is -inf, `F` is -inf, `max_diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`, `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, `index` is set to 2 if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, otherwise `index` remains `None`, `i` is 3, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`**

In natural language: `max_diff` is now equal to `A[3] - A[2]`. All other variables retain their previous values.
