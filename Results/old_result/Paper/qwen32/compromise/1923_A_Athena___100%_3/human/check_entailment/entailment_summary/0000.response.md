### Reasoning:
The program's goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips such that they form a single contiguous block without any free cells between them. The program's approach is to strip the leading and trailing zeros from the list of cells and then count the number of zeros that remain in between the first and last chip.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic for each test case:

1. **Strip Leading and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program first removes all leading zeros from the list using `while a and a[0] == 0: a.pop(0)`.
   - Then, it removes all trailing zeros using `while a and a[-1] == 0: a.pop()`.

2. **Count the Zeros in Between:**
   - After stripping the leading and trailing zeros, the program counts the number of zeros in the remaining list using `for i in range(len(a)): if a[i] == 0: res += 1`.

3. **Output the Count:**
   - The count of zeros in between the first and last chip is printed as the result for each test case.

This approach correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required because every zero in between the first and last chip represents a necessary move of a chip to the left to fill that gap.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's verify this with the first test case from the example:
- Input: `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
- After stripping leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 1 0 1 1`
- Count of zeros in between: `1` (The chip at position 5 needs to move to position 4, which requires 1 operation.)

This matches the expected output of `1` for the first test case.

### Conclusion:
Given the problem description and the provided execution summary, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips without any free cells between them.

Correctness: **True**
