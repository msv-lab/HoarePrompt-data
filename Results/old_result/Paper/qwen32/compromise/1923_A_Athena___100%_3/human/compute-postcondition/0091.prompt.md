Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Each of the following t test cases consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1. In each test case, there is at least one a_i that equals 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = 0
    while a and a[0] == 0:
        a.pop(0)
    while a and a[-1] == 0:
        a.pop()
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] == 0:
            res += 1
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is the length of `a` after removing all trailing zeros where 1 <= `n` <= 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, the first element is not 0 if `a` is not empty; `res` is the count of 0s in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 999; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list; `res` is the count of 0s in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` - 2 <= 999, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed, and `res` is the total count of `0` elements in the list `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
