The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that the last element of `a` is `0`, this element is removed, and the length of the list `a` is reduced by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is `n - 1` where 1 <= `n - 1` <= 49; `a` is a list of `n - 2` integers where each integer is either `0` or `1`, the first element is not `0`; `res` is `0`**.
