The code snippet `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that the last element of `a` is `0` (as per the initial state), this element will be removed. Therefore, the length of the list `a` will decrease by 1, and the last element will no longer be `0`. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` must be at least 3; `a` is a list of `n - 3` integers where each integer is either `0` or `1`, the first element is not `0`; `res` is `0`.**
