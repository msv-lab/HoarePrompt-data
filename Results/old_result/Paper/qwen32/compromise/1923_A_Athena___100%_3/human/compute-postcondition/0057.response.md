The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. The other variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list with at least one element.
- `i` is `i + 1` (which means `i` has been incremented by 1 already).

The only change is that `res` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list with at least one element; `i` is `i + 1`; `res` is `res + 1`.**
