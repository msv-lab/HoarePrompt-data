Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` - 2 <= 999, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is incremented by 1, `res` is 2 if the current element `a[i]` is 0; otherwise, `res` is 1**

This means that the value of `res` has been incremented by 1. If the current element `a[i]` was 0, `res` was initially 1 and is now 2. If the current element `a[i]` was not 0, `res` was initially 0 and is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
