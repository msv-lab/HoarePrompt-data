Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` - 2 <= 999; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is the count of 0s in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The list `a` is updated to contain integers from the input, and the count of 0s in this list (`res`) is not yet recalculated. All other variables remain unchanged.
