The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that the initial state of `a` is `[0]`, after executing `a.pop()`, the list `a` will be empty.

Here is the updated state of the variables:
- `t` remains an integer such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 999.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `a` is now an empty list `[]`.
- `res` remains 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 999; `n` is an input integer; `a` is `[]`; `res` is 0**.
