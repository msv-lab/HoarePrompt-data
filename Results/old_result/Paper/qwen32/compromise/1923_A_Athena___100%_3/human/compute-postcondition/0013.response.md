The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given the initial state, the last element of `a` is `0`. After removing this element, the length of `a` decreases by 1, so `n` is also decremented by 1. The values of `t`, `res`, and the remaining elements of `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is `n - 1` where 1 <= `n - 1` <= 49; `a` is a list of `n - 1` integers where each integer is either `0` or `1`, the first element is not `0`; `res` is `0`**
