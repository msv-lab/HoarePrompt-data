### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function checks if `k` is even and if it is within the permissible range for the given `n`.
   - The maximum possible value of `k` depends on whether `n` is even or odd:
     - If `n` is odd, the maximum `k` is `(n^2 - 1) // 2`.
     - If `n` is even, the maximum `k` is `n^2 // 2`.
   - If `k` is odd or exceeds the maximum possible value, the function returns `(0, 0)`, indicating that no valid permutation exists for the given `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function generates a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k // 2`.
   - The function starts with the list `[1, 2, ..., n]` and rearranges it by moving the last element to specific positions based on the value of `k`.
   - The rearrangement process continues until `k` is reduced to 0.
   - The function is intended to create a permutation with the desired Manhattan value, but it does not guarantee that the permutation will have the exact Manhattan value `k` because `k` is halved before processing.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the permutation if a valid permutation is found.
   - It prints the elements of the list `l` in the same order, separated by spaces.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_2` to validate `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is 0 (indicating that `k` was odd or exceeded the maximum possible value), it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then `func_3` to print the permutation.

### Issues:
- The primary issue is that `func_1` is designed to work with `k // 2` rather than `k`. This means that the function will not generate a permutation with the exact Manhattan value `k` unless `k` is even and can be achieved by the rearrangement process.
- If `k` is odd, `func_2` correctly identifies that no valid permutation exists, but if `k` is even but cannot be achieved by the rearrangement process in `func_1`, the program will still attempt to generate a permutation, which may not meet the requirement.

### Conclusion:
Given the above points, the program does not correctly handle all cases where `k` is even but cannot be achieved by the rearrangement process in `func_1`. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

**Correctness: False**
