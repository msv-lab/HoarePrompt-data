Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12). The function returns (0, 0) in two cases: Case_1 and Case_2 (which are not further specified in the provided information). If `k` is even, the function returns the tuple (n, k).**
