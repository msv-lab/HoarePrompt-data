The variables in the loop head are `l` and `h`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables to ensure the loop can execute one more time. The loop condition is `l < h`. Given the state at the end of the previous iteration is `l < h - 1`, we need to ensure that after the adjustments, `l < h` still holds true.

From the description, we know that:
- If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1` while `h` and `mid` remain unchanged.
- Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid` while `l` and `mid` remain unchanged.

Since `l < h - 1`, we need to make sure that after the update, `l < h` still holds. If `l` is incremented, it should still be less than `h`. If `h` is updated to `mid`, it should be greater than `l`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we can keep `l` and `h` in a state where `l < h - 1` holds true. This way, regardless of whether `l` is incremented or `h` is updated to `mid`, the condition `l < h` will still be satisfied.

Therefore, no adjustment is necessary as the current state `l < h - 1` already ensures that `l < h` will hold true for the next iteration.

State: **`l` and `h` are indices in `D` such that `l < h - 1`.**
