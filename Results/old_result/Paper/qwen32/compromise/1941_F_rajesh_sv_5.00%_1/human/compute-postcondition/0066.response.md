Output State: **`l` is `mid + 1`, `h` is the index found by `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `D` must have at least two elements, `left - f` must be less than some element in `D`, and `right - f` must be greater than some element in `D`. `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. The current value of `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`.**

In simple terms, the value of `l` has been updated to `mid + 1`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
