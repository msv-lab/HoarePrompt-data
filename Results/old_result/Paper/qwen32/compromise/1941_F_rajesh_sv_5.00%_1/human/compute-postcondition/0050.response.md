The code snippet reassigns the value of `mid` to `l + (h - l) // 2`. Since the initial state already defines `mid` as `l + (h - l) // 2`, reassigning it does not change its value. Therefore, the value of `mid` remains the same, and the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` also remain unchanged as they depend on `mid` and other variables that are not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`; `h` must be at least `l + 1`**.
