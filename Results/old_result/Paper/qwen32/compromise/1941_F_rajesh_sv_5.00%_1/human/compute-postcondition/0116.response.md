Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`, which are integers representing the number of problems, models, and functions respectively. It also accepts three lists: `A` of `n` integers representing the complexities of the problems in strictly increasing order, `D` of `m` integers representing the complexities of the models, and `F` of `k` integers representing the complexities of the functions. The function returns the number of models that can be matched with at least one problem and at least one function, where a model can be matched with a problem or a function if its complexity is greater than or equal to the complexity of the problem or function.**
