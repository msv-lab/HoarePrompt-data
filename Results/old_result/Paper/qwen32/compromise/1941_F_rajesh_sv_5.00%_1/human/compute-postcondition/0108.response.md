Postcondition: **`l` is updated to `mid + 1` or remains the smallest index such that `D[l] > left - f` and `l < h`. `h` is updated to the largest index in `D` such that `D[h] < right - f` and `h > l` or remains equal to `mid`. `mid` is now equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`. `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`. `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`. Ensure `l < h` after updates. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `h` is set to the largest index in `D` such that `D[h] < right - f` and `h > l` or remains equal to `mid`. Otherwise, `l` is set to `mid + 1` or remains the smallest index such that `D[l] > left - f` and `l < h`, and `h` is set to `mid`.**
