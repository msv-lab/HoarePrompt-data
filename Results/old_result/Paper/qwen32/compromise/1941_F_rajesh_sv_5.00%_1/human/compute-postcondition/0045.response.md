The code snippet reassigns the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` using the same expressions that were used to initialize them in the Initial State. Since the expressions remain the same, the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` do not change. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State for these variables.

Output State: **`mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`; `h` must be at least `l + 1`**.
