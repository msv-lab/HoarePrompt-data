Output State: **`l` and `h` are indices in `D` such that `l < h - 1`, `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, `D` must have at least two elements with `left - f` less than some element in `D` and `right - f` greater than some element in `D`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. `h` is now `mid`.**

In simple terms, the value of `h` has been updated to be equal to `mid`. All other variables and conditions remain the same.
