Output State: **`mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`; `h` is `mid`**

Explanation:
- The value of `mid` remains `l + (h - l) // 2`.
- The value of `mid_sum` remains `D[mid] + f`.
- The value of `mid_next_sum` remains `D[mid + 1] + f`.
- The value of `h` is now updated to be equal to `mid`. 

The precondition that `h` must be at least `l + 1` is still valid as long as it holds true before the assignment `h = mid`. The output state reflects the changes made by the code snippet.
