The code snippet `l = bisect_right(D, left - f)` uses the `bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module to find the insertion point in the sorted list `D` where `left - f` would maintain the sorted order. Here, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, and `f` is an element from the list `F`.

The value of `l` will be the index in `D` where `left - f` would be inserted to keep `D` sorted. Since the exact values of `left`, `f`, and `D` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `l`. However, we know that `l` will be an integer between 0 and the length of `D`.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers returned by `func_4()`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers from `A`, `F` is a list returned by `func_4()` that must have at least one element, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index where `max_diff` was found, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is `max_diff`, `l` is the index in `D` where `left - f` would be inserted to maintain sorted order.**
