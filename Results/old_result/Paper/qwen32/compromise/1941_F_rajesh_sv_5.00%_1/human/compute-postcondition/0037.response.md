Output State: **`mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`; `l` is unchanged; `h` is unchanged; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

In this output state, the values of `mid`, `l`, and `h` remain unchanged from the initial state. Two new variables, `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum`, are introduced. `mid_sum` is calculated as the value of `D[mid]` plus `f`, and `mid_next_sum` is calculated as the value of `D[mid + 1]` plus `f`.
