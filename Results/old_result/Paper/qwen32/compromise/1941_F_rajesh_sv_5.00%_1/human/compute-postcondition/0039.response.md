The code snippet `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` to be `mid + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `mid` was initially `l + (h - l) // 2`, the new value of `l` is `l + (h - l) // 2 + 1`.

Output State: **`mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`; `l` is `l + (h - l) // 2 + 1`; `h` is unchanged; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. The condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` is true.**
