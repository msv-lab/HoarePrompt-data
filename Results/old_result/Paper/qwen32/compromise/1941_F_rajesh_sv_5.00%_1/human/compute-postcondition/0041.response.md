Output State: **`mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`; `l` is unchanged; `h` is `mid`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. Additionally, `mid_sum - left` is greater than or equal to `right - mid_next_sum`.**

In simple terms, the value of `h` has been updated to be equal to `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged.
