The code snippet assigns new values to `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` based on the values of `D[mid]`, `D[mid + 1]`, and `f`. The values of `l`, `h`, and `mid` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` and `h` are indices in `D` such that `l < h - 1`; `mid` is the integer value calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**
