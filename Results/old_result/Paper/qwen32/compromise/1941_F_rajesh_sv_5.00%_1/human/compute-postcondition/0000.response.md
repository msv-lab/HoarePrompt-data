Output State: **`testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()`, where 1 <= `testcases` <= 10^4.**

Explanation: The variable `testcases` is updated to hold the value returned by the function `func_3()`. The precondition that `testcases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, remains valid, with the specific value now being determined by the return value of `func_3()`.
