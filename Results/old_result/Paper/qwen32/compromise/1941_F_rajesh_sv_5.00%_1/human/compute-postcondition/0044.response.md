The code snippet reassigns the value of `mid` to `l + (h - l) // 2`. This operation does not affect the values of `mid_sum` or `mid_next_sum` since they are not modified in the given code snippet. The precondition that `h` must be at least `l + 1` remains valid after the code has been executed.

Output State: **`mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`; `h` must be at least `l + 1`**
