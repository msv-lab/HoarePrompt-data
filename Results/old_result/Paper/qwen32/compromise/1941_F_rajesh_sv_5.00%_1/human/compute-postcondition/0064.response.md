The code snippet assigns new values to `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` based on the values of `D[mid]`, `D[mid + 1]`, and `f`. Specifically, `mid_sum` is set to `D[mid] + f` and `mid_next_sum` is set to `D[mid + 1] + f`. The other variables (`l`, `h`, `mid`, `D`, `left`, `right`, and `f`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is the index found by `bisect_right(D, left - f)`, `h` is the index found by `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `D` must have at least two elements, `left - f` must be less than some element in `D`, and `right - f` must be greater than some element in `D`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**
