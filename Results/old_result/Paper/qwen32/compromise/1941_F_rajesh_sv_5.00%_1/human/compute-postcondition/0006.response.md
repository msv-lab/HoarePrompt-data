The code snippet only calls the function `func_6()` without any operations that affect the variable `testcases`. Therefore, the value of `testcases` remains unchanged after the function call. Since `func_6()` does not return a value and there are no other operations modifying `testcases`, the state of `testcases` stays the same.

Output State: **`testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()` minus 2, where `0 <= testcases - 1 <= 10^4 - 2`**.
