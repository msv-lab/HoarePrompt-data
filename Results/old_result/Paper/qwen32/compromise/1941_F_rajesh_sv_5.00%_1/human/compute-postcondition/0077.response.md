Output State: **`l` and `h` are indices in `D` such that `l < h - 1`; `mid` is the integer value calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`.**

In natural language: The indices `l` and `h` remain as indices in `D` with the condition `l < h - 1` still holding. A new variable `mid` is introduced and assigned the value of `l + (h - l) // 2`.
