Correctness: **False**

The provided program is mostly correct in terms of logic but there is an issue with the order of function definition and usage. In Python, functions must be defined before they are called. In the given program, `func_1(s)` is called before its definition, which will result in a `NameError`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    prefix_balance = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_balance.append((balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([x[2] for x in prefix_balance])
    return result

s = input().strip()
print(func_1(s))
```

With this correction, the program should work as expected and the response would be:

Correctness: **True**
