To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to analyze the loop's behavior based on the given initial state and the loop code.

The initial state is:
- `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_1()`
- `arr` is a list returned by `func_2()`
- `pos` is initialized to -1

The loop iterates `n` times, and for each iteration `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`, it checks if `arr[i]` is equal to `k`. If the condition is true, it updates `pos` to the current index `i`.

After the loop finishes:
- If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` will hold the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`.
- If `k` is not found in `arr`, `pos` will remain -1.

The values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, and any other variables not mentioned in the loop head or body remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state can be described as:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise `pos` is -1.**
