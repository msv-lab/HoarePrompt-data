The value of `l` is incremented by 1. Given that initially `l` is increased by 2, after the code execution, `l` will be increased by 3. The condition that `r` must be greater than `l + 1` still holds because `l` has been incremented by 1, not 2. The condition that `a[l]` must be equal to `a[l + 1]` still holds as well because the code does not affect the array `a` or the relationship between `a[l]` and `a[l + 1]`.

Output State: **`l` is increased by 3, `r` must be greater than `l + 1`, `a[l]` must be equal to `a[l + 1]`**.
