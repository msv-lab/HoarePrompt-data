The value of `r` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `r` is `le - 2`, so after the operation, `r` becomes `le - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is `le - 3`, `l` is `le - 3`, `a` is a list where all elements are the same, `end` is 3, `ans` is `max(0, le - 2n)` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise `ans` is `le - n`, `n` is the new input integer, `le` is the length of the new `a`, `st` is `le`**.
