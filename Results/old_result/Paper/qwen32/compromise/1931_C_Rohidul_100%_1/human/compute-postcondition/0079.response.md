Output State: **`r` is `le - 2`, `l` is `le - 2`, `a` is a list where all elements are the same, `end` is 1, `ans` is `max(0, le - 2n)` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise `ans` is `le - n`, `n` is the new input integer, `le` is the length of the new `a`, `st` is `le`.**

In natural language: The value of `r` has been decremented by 1, making it `le - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
