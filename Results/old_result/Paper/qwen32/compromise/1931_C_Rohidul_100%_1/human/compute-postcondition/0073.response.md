Output State: **`r` must be at least 2, `l` is 2, `a` is a list where the first two elements are the same, `end` is 1, `ans` is `max(0, le - 2n)` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise `ans` is `le - n`, `n` is the new input integer, `le` is the length of the new `a`, `st` is 3.**

In this output state, the only variable that has changed is `st`, which has been incremented by 1 from its initial value of 2 to 3. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
