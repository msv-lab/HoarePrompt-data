To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression `ans = le - max(st, end)`. Given the initial state, `r` is `l` and `end` is incremented by 1, but the variables `le`, `st`, and `end` are not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, we can still express the output state in terms of these variables.

The expression calculates the value of `ans` by subtracting the maximum of `st` and `end` from `le`. Since `end` is incremented by 1 in the initial state, the value of `end` used in the calculation is `end + 1`.

Output State: **`r` is `l`, `end` is incremented by 1, `ans` is `le - max(st, end + 1)`**
