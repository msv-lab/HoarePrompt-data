The code snippet provided is `end += 1`, which increments the value of the variable `end` by 1. The initial state specifies the conditions and values of `l`, `st`, `r`, and `a[l]` and `a[l + 1]`, but none of these variables are affected by the executed line of code. Therefore, only `end` changes in the output state.

Output State: **`l` is the index where `a[l] != a[l + 1]` or `l == r`, `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from index 0, `r` is `l`, and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`, `end` is incremented by 1.**
