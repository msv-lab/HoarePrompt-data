The code snippet `st += 1` increments the value of `st` by 1. The other variables `l`, `r`, and the elements of the list `a` remain unchanged according to the initial state provided.

Output State: **`l` is increased by 3, `r` must be greater than `l + 1`, `a[l]` must be equal to `a[l + 1]`, `st` is increased by 1**.
