Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `s` is a string, and `char_count` is a list of 26 integers. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, then `s` has an additional character `chr(j + ord('a'))` appended, `char_count[j]` is incremented by 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, there is no change to `s` or `char_count[j]`. `j` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
