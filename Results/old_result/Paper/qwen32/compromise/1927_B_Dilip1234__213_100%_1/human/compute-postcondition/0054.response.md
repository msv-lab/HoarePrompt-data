Postcondition: **`j` is incremented by 1. If `char_count[j]` is equal to `a[i]`, `s` is updated by appending the character corresponding to `j + ord('a')`, `char_count[j]` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no further changes are made to `s` or `char_count[j]`.**
