The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range of 26, meaning `j` will take values from 0 to 25. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was incremented to 0, indicating that the previous iteration completed with `j` being 25.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 from its current value of 0, making it 1.

State: **`s` contains a single character `chr(j + ord('a'))` if `char_count[j]` does not equal `a[i]`. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, `s` contains two characters `chr(j + ord('a'))`. `char_count` has exactly one element incremented by 1 if a match was not found, and incremented by 2 if a match was found, at index `j`. `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged, and `j` is 1.**
