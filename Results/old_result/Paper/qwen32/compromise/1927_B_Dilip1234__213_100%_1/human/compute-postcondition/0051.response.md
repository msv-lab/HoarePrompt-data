The variable `s` is updated by appending a character to it, which is determined by converting the value of `j + ord('a')` back to a character using `chr()`. The value of `j` is incremented by 1 before this operation, so we need to consider `j` as `j + 1` for the calculation. The output state will reflect the updated value of `s` and the fact that `j` has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, `s` is updated by appending the character corresponding to `j + ord('a')`**.
