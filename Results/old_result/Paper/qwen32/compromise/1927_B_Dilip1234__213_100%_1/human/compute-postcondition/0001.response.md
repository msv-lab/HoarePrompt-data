The code snippet initializes a list named `char_count` with 26 elements, all set to 0. This list is intended to keep track of the count of each lowercase Latin letter (from 'a' to 'z').

Given the initial state, the variable `t` (number of test cases), `n` (number of integers in each test case), and the list `a` (list of integers) remain unchanged. The string `s` remains an empty string as well.

The only change is the introduction of the `char_count` list, which is now initialized.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `s` is an empty string; `char_count` is a list of 26 integers, all initialized to 0.**
