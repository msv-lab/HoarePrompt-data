The code snippet `s += chr(j + ord('a'))` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j + ord('a')` to the string `s`. Given the initial state, `j` is incremented by 1 before this operation, so the character appended will be the one corresponding to the new value of `j`.

Let's break it down:

- Initially, `s` is a string that includes 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' plus a character corresponding to `j` in the alphabet if `char_count[j] == a[i]`.
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- The character corresponding to the new value of `j` is appended to `s`.

Therefore, the new character appended to `s` is `chr(j + ord('a'))`, where `j` is the incremented value.

Output State: **`s` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' + character corresponding to `j` in the alphabet if `char_count[j] == a[i]`, plus the character corresponding to the new incremented `j` in the alphabet; `char_count` has a 2 at index `j` and 1s elsewhere; `i` remains unchanged; `n` remains unchanged; `j` is incremented by 1.**
