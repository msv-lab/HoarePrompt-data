Output State: **`s` contains two characters `chr(j + ord('a'))`, `char_count` has exactly one element incremented by 1 at index `j`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged, and `j` is 0.**

Natural language: The string `s` now contains two identical characters, each being `chr(j + ord('a'))`. The `char_count` list still has exactly one element incremented by 1 at index `j`. The variable `i` has been incremented by 1, `n` remains unchanged, and `j` remains 0.
