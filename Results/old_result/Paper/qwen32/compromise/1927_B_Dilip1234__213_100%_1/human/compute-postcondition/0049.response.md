Postcondition: **`s` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' + character corresponding to `j` in the alphabet if `char_count[j] == a[i]`, and if `char_count[j] == a[i]`, it also includes the character corresponding to the new incremented `j` in the alphabet. `char_count` has a 3 at index `j` and 1s elsewhere if `char_count[j] == a[i]`; otherwise, `s` and `char_count` remain unchanged. `i` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and `j` is incremented by 1.**
