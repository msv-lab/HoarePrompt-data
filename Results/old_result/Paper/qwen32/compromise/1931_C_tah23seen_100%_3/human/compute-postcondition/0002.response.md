The code assigns the value of `len(arr) - 1` to the variable `j`. Since `arr` is a list of integers with length `n`, `j` will be equal to `n - 1`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`; `i` is 0; `j` is `n - 1`.**
