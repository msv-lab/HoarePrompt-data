The code snippet provided initializes the variable `i` to 0. The initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`. The execution of the code does not affect `arr` or `n`; it only sets `i` to 0.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`; `i` is 0.**
