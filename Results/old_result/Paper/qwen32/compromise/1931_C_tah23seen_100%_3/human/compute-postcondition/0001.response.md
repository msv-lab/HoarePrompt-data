The code snippet assigns the length of the list `arr` to the variable `n`. Since the initial state already specifies that `n` is the length of the list `arr`, the value of `n` does not change. The variable `i` remains 0 as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`; `i` is 0.**
