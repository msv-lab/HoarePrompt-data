Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect based on the problem description:

1. **Global `soma` variable**: The `soma` variable is not being reset for each test case. This means that the sum from previous test cases will carry over to the next test case, which is incorrect.

2. **Loop range**: The outer loop runs `N` times, but the loop should run `t` times (where `t` is the number of test cases). The variable `N` is used, but it should be `t`.

3. **Range for summing digits**: The inner loop runs from `0` to `n-1` (inclusive), but it should run from `1` to `n` (inclusive) as per the problem statement.

4. **Output format**: The program should output the result for each test case on a new line, but it currently accumulates all results into a single `soma` variable and prints it once at the end.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    soma = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)
```

This version correctly resets `soma` for each test case, iterates from `1` to `n` inclusive, and prints the result for each test case on a new line.
