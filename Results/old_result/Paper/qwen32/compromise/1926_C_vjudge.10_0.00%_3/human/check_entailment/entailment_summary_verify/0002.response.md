### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment based on the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Variable Initialization and Scope**:
   - The variable `soma` is initialized outside the loop that handles each test case. This means that the sum from all test cases will accumulate in `soma`, which is indeed incorrect. Each test case should be processed independently, and the result for each should be printed separately.

2. **Loop Range**:
   - The inner loop `for i in range(n):` iterates from 0 to `n-1`, not from 1 to `n` inclusive. This is incorrect as per the problem description, which requires summing the digits of integers from 1 to `n`.

3. **Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1(i)` is called inside the inner loop correctly to compute the sum of digits of each number `i`. The function `func_1` is defined after the main logic, which is not a syntax error but is not a best practice. It's better to define functions before they are used.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final value of `soma` after processing all test cases, which is incorrect. It should print the result for each test case separately.

### Corrected Version:
The corrected version of the program, as suggested in the original assessment, should look like this:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))

N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    soma = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Start from 1 to n inclusive
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)  # Print the result for each test case
```

### Evaluation:
The original assessment correctly identifies the issues in the provided program and suggests a corrected version. The original program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description due to the reasons mentioned above.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
