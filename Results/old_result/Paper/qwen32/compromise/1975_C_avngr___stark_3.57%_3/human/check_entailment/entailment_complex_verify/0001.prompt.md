You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Chamo gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Mocha doesn't like arrays containing different numbers, so Mocha decides to
use magic to change the array. Mocha can perform the following three-step
operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  1. Choose indices l and r (1 \leq l < r \leq n ) 
  2. Let x be the median^\dagger of the subarray [a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r] 
  3. Set all values a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r to x 

Suppose a=[1,2,3,4,5] initially:

  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(3,4) in the first operation, then x=3 , the array will be changed into a=[1,2,3,3,5] . 
  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(1,3) in the first operation, then x=2 , the array will be changed into a=[2,2,2,4,5] . 

Mocha will perform the operation until the array contains only the same
number. Mocha wants to know what is the maximum possible value of this number.

^\dagger The median in an array b of length m is an element that occupies
position number \lfloor \frac{m+1}{2} \rfloor after we sort the elements in
non-decreasing order. For example, the median of [3,1,4,1,5] is 3 and the
median of [5,25,20,24] is 20 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum value of the number.

Example

Input

    2
    
    2
    
    1 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 3 4 5

Output

    1
    4
    
Note

In the first test case, a=[1,2] . Mocha can only choose the interval
(l,r)=(1,2) . The array will be changed to a=[1,1] . Therefore, the answer is
1 .

In the second test case, Mocha can perform the following operations:

  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(4,5) , then a=[1,2,3,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(3,5) , then a=[1,2,4,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(1,5) , then a=[4,4,4,4,4] . 

The array contains only the same number, which is 4 . It can be proven that
the maximum value of the final number cannot be greater than 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        max = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            if min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max:
                max = min(a[i], a[i - 1])
        print(max)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), representing the length of the array a. This is followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), representing the elements of the array a. The total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        max = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max:

        print(max)
        
    #State: `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the input integer for each test case, `a` is the list of integers read from the input for each test case, and `max` is the maximum value of the minimums of consecutive pairs in the list `a` for each test case. The loop has executed `t` times, and the final output consists of `t` lines, each containing the `max` value for the corresponding test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the length of an array, followed by `n` integers representing the elements of the array. For each test case, it calculates the maximum value of the minimums of consecutive pairs in the array and prints this value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to find the maximum possible value of the number that can fill the entire array after performing the specified operations. The operations allow us to select a subarray, find its median, and set all elements in that subarray to the median. We need to maximize the final uniform value of the array.

### Key Points
1. **Median Selection**: The median of a sorted subarray is chosen to replace all elements in that subarray.
2. **Objective**: Maximize the final value in the array after any number of operations.

### Strategy
To maximize the final value, it would be ideal to repeatedly select subarrays that include the largest possible median. However, the simplest strategy to ensure we get the maximum possible value is to consider the largest consecutive pair of elements in the array. This is because the median of any subarray containing these two elements will at least be the smaller of the two, and we want to maximize this value.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array and finding the maximum of the minimums of consecutive pairs. Here's a breakdown of the logic:
- It initializes `max` to 0.
- It iterates through the array from the second element to the last.
- For each pair of consecutive elements `(a[i-1], a[i])`, it updates `max` to be the maximum of its current value and the minimum of the pair.

### Correctness Evaluation
The logic in the program is flawed. The program is trying to find the maximum of the minimums of consecutive pairs, which does not necessarily lead to the maximum possible median that can fill the entire array. The correct approach should involve considering larger subarrays and their medians, but the problem can be simplified by realizing that the maximum possible final value is the maximum value in the array itself.

### Counterexample
Consider the array `[1, 3, 2, 5, 4]`. The program will find the maximum of the minimums of consecutive pairs:
- min(1, 3) = 1
- min(3, 2) = 2
- min(2, 5) = 2
- min(5, 4) = 4

The program will output `4`, which is correct in this case, but it does not generalize to always finding the maximum possible median. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the program will output `2`, whereas the correct answer is `4`.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the strategy to find the maximum possible value that can fill the entire array after the operations. The correct approach should involve finding the maximum value in the array, as this value can always be achieved by selecting appropriate subarrays.
