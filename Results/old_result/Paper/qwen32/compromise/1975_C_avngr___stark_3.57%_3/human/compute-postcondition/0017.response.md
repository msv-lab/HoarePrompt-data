The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. Since `_` does not hold any meaningful state that needs to be preserved or modified, the only state that needs adjustment is `t` itself.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is decremented by 1 because each iteration of the loop corresponds to processing one test case. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0 (specifically, it is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration); `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `max` is the maximum value of the minimums of all consecutive pairs in the list `a`.**
