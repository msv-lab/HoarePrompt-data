Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` must be greater than 5; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 5. If `min(a[5], a[4]) > max`, then `max` is updated to `min(a[5], a[4])`. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.**
