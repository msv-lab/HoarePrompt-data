In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The underscore `_` is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to adjust the state such that `t` is greater than 0. There is no other variable in the loop head that needs adjustment.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0**
