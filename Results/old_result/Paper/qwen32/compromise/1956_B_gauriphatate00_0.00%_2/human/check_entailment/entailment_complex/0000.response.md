### Reasoning:

To determine if the program is correct, we need to verify if the provided functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally, given that Nene plays optimally as well.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:

- **Objective**: The function `func_1(n, a)` calculates the maximum number of points you can get in the card game.
- **Logic**:
  - It counts the number of integers that appear exactly twice in the list `a` (representing your hand). This is stored in the variable `pairs`.
  - The function then returns the minimum of `pairs` and `n // 2`. This is because:
    - `pairs` represents the maximum number of points you can get if you play optimally. You can get a point each time you play a card that has already been placed on the table.
    - `n // 2` represents the maximum number of turns you get to play. Since there are `2n` cards and each player gets `n` turns, you can play at most `n` cards.
  - The minimum of these two values is the correct result because you can't get more points than the number of pairs you have, and you also can't get more points than the number of turns you have.

#### Analysis of `func_2`:

- **Objective**: The function `func_2()` reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.
- **Logic**:
  - It reads the input and splits it into a list of strings.
  - It processes each test case by extracting the number of cards `n` and the list of cards `a`.
  - It calls `func_1(n, a)` for each test case and stores the result.
  - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

#### Verification:

- The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally, given that Nene plays optimally.
- The logic in `func_2` correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct as both functions together meet the problem description and produce the correct output for the given examples.
