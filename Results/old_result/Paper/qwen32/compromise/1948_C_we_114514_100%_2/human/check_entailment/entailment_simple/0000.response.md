### Reasoning:

The given problem requires determining if a robot can move from the top-left corner (1, 1) to the bottom-right corner (2, n) of a 2xN grid, based on the directions provided by arrows in each cell. The robot can move in four directions (left, right, up, down) in the first step and then must follow the direction of the arrow in the cell it lands in.

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by analyzing the grid configuration and checking for specific conditions that would prevent the robot from reaching the target cell (2, n).

Here's a breakdown of the logic in `func_1`:

1. **Loop through the first half of the grid (up to `n // 2 - 1`)**:
   - For each odd-indexed column in the first row (`2*i + 1`), the program checks if the arrow points left (`'<'`).
   - If it does, it then checks if either of the arrows in the corresponding even-indexed columns in the second row (`2*i` or `2*i + 2`) also points left (`'<'`).
   - If both conditions are met, the function returns `'No'` because the robot would get stuck in a loop or be unable to move forward.

2. **Check the last column**:
   - After the loop, the function checks if the last cell in the first row (`row1[n - 1]`) points left (`'<'`) and the second-to-last cell in the second row (`row2[n - 2]`) also points left (`'<'`).
   - If both conditions are met, the function returns `'No'` for similar reasons as above.

3. **Return `'Yes'` if none of the above conditions are met**:
   - If none of the conditions that would prevent the robot from reaching the target are met, the function returns `'Yes'`.

### Analysis of the Program's Correctness:

The program's logic seems to be based on identifying configurations that would trap the robot in a loop or prevent it from reaching the target cell. However, it does not account for all possible paths the robot can take. For example, it does not consider the robot's ability to move up and down between rows, which can significantly impact the robot's ability to reach the target.

The provided examples in the problem statement do not cover all possible scenarios, but the program fails to correctly handle some of them. For instance, the program does not consider the possibility of the robot moving up and down between rows in a way that allows it to bypass certain configurations that would otherwise be considered blocking.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the program's logic is not comprehensive enough to determine if the robot can reach the target cell in all possible scenarios. Therefore, the program is not correct for all cases.

**Correctness: False**
