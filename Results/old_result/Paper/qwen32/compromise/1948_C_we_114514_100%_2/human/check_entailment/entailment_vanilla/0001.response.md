Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The robot starts at position (1, 1) and needs to reach (2, n) by following the rules:
1. It can move in one of four directions: left, right, up, or down.
2. After moving, it must move in the direction of the arrow in the cell it lands on.

The program has two functions:
1. `func_1(n, row1, row2)`: This function determines if it's possible to reach the target for a given grid configuration.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the logic in `func_1`:
- The variable `half_n` is calculated as `n // 2`.
- The loop iterates from `0` to `half_n - 2` (which is equivalent to iterating over the even indices of the grid up to `n-2`).
- Inside the loop, it checks if there is a left arrow (`<`) at an odd index in `row1` and a left arrow (`<`) at either the corresponding even index or the next even index in `row2`. If this condition is true, it returns 'No'.
- After the loop, it checks if the last cell in `row1` has a left arrow (`<`) and the second last cell in `row2` has a left arrow (`<`). If this condition is true, it returns 'No'.
- If none of the above conditions are met, it returns 'Yes'.

### Correctness Check
The logic in `func_1` appears to be based on the observation that if there is a left arrow in `row1` at an odd index and a left arrow in `row2` at the corresponding or next even index, the robot will be trapped and unable to reach (2, n). Similarly, if the last cell in `row1` and the second last cell in `row2` both have left arrows, the robot will be unable to move right from (1, n-1) to (2, n).

However, this logic is not comprehensive enough to cover all scenarios. For example, consider a grid where the robot can zigzag between the rows using right arrows to eventually reach the target. The given logic does not account for such paths.

### Example Counter-case
Consider the following grid:
```
>>><
><>>
```
For `n = 4`, the program will incorrectly return 'No' because it will encounter the condition `row1[2 * i + 1] == '<' and (row2[2 * i] == '<' or row2[2 * i + 2] == '<')` when `i = 0` (i.e., checking `row1[1]` and `row2[0]` or `row2[2]`), but this does not mean the robot is trapped. The robot can move as follows:
- (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4)

Thus, the logic in `func_1` is incomplete and can lead to incorrect results for certain grid configurations.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach (2, n) for all possible grid configurations.

**Correctness: False**
