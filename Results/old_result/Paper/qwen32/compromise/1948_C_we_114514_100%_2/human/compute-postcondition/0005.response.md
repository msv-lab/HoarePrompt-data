To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` for each of the `t` iterations.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement uses the `join` method to concatenate all elements in the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).
- Each element in the `results` list is the result of calling `func_1(n, row1, row2)` for each iteration.
- Since the exact values of `n`, `row1`, `row2`, and `t` are not provided, we can't determine the exact values of the elements in the `results` list.
- However, we can describe the output in terms of the elements of the `results` list.

### Output Description:
- The `print` statement will output each element of the `results` list on a new line.

### Final Output:
Output: **Each element of the `results` list on a new line (where `results` contains the results of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` for each of the `t` iterations)**
