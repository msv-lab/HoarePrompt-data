To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's analyze the given loop and the code within it.

The loop iterates `t` times, and in each iteration, it performs the following actions:
- Reads an integer `n` (which is the length of the two strings `row1` and `row2`).
- Reads two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n`.
- Calls a function `func_1(n, row1, row2)` and appends the result to the list `results`.

The variables `n`, `row1`, and `row2` are re-assigned in each iteration, and the value of `t` remains constant. The list `results` accumulates the results of `func_1` for each iteration.

Given that the initial state of `results` is an empty list, the final state of `results` will be a list containing the results of `func_1` for each of the `t` iterations.

Therefore, the output state after the loop finishes executing all iterations is:

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` for each of the `t` iterations.**
