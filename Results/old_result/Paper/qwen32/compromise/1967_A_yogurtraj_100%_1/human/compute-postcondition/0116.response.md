Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 4, `r` is `a[4] + k // 5`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `k` is either 0 or `k - 4 * (a[5] - a[4])`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `y` is updated to `n - 1 - i`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
