Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is 0, `i` is 2, `k` is decreased by (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]), `y` is 0, `r` is `a[2]`.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated by subtracting the expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its previous value. All other variables retain their initial values as given in the initial state, except for `y` and `r`, which have been set to 0 and `a[2]` respectively.
