To determine the output of the provided `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the expression inside the `print` statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `ii` is set to 1.
- `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.
- `rem` is initialized to 0.
- `y` is initialized to 0.
- `r` is set to the last element of the list `a` (i.e., `a[n - 1]`).
- `k` is explicitly set to 0.

### Expression Analysis:
The expression inside the `print` statement is:
```
(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y
```

Let's break down the expression using the initial state:
1. **`r`**: This is the last element of the sorted list `a`. Since `a` is sorted and `r` is `a[n - 1]`, `r` is the largest element in the list `a`.
2. **`n`**: This is the number of elements in the list `a`.
3. **`rem`**: This is explicitly set to 0.
4. **`y`**: This is explicitly set to 0.

Now, substituting the known values into the expression:
```
(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y
= (r - 1) * n + 1 + 0 + 0
= (r - 1) * n + 1
```

### Final Output:
The output of the `print` statement is the result of the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1`.

Thus, the final output can be described as:
Output: **(r - 1) * n + 1 (where r is the last element of the sorted list `a` and n is the number of elements in the list `a`)**
