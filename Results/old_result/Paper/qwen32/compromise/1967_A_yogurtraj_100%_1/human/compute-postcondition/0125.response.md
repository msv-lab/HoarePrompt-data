To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the values and relationships of the variables involved based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `ii` is 2.
- `n` is the same as `ii`, so `n` is 2.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `rem` is 0.
- `y` is 0.
- `r` is calculated as `a[n - 1] + k // n`, which translates to `a[1] + k // 2` since `n` is 2.
- `k` is updated to `k - (n - 1) * (a[n - 1] - a[n - 2])`, which translates to `k - (2 - 1) * (a[1] - a[0])` or `k - (a[1] - a[0])`.
- `k` is not 0.

### Print Statement:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Calculate `r`:**
   - `r = a[1] + k // 2`
   - Since `a` is a sorted list of integers, `a[1]` is the second smallest element in the list.

2. **Calculate `k % n`:**
   - `k % n` is the remainder when `k` is divided by `n` (which is 2).
   - This will be either 0 or 1.

3. **Substitute `r` and `k % n` into the print statement:**
   - The expression becomes: `((a[1] + k // 2) - 1) * 2 + 1 + k % 2`
   - Simplify the expression: `(a[1] + k // 2 - 1) * 2 + 1 + k % 2`

### Detailed Explanation:
- `a[1]` is the second smallest integer in the sorted list `a`.
- `k // 2` is the integer division of `k` by 2.
- `k % 2` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2, which can be either 0 or 1.

### Final Output:
The final value printed by the code depends on the specific values of `a[1]` and `k`. However, based on the given relationships and calculations, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(a[1] + k // 2 - 1) * 2 + 1 + k % 2 (where a[1] is the second smallest element in the sorted list a, and k is an integer not equal to 0)**
