Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `r` is the first element of the list `a`, `rem` is 0.**

This means that the variable `rem` has been assigned the value 0, while all other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
