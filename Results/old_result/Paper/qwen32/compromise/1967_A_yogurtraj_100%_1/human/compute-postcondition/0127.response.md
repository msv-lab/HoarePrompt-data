To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state and analyze the expression step by step.

### Given Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100.
- `ii` is 2.
- `n` is the same as `ii`, so `n` is 2.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `rem` is 0.
- `y` is 0.
- `r` is `a[n - 1]`, which means `r` is the last element of the list `a` because `n - 1` is 1 (since `n` is 2).
- `k` is 0.

### Expression to Evaluate:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Value of `r`**: Since `r` is `a[n - 1]` and `n` is 2, `r` is the second element of the sorted list `a`. Let's denote this element as `a[1]`.
2. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - `(r - 1) * n`: This part of the expression calculates `(a[1] - 1) * 2`.
   - `+ 1`: Adds 1 to the result of the previous step.
   - `+ rem`: Since `rem` is 0, this does not change the value.
   - `+ y`: Since `y` is 0, this does not change the value.

### Final Expression:
The expression simplifies to:
```python
(r - 1) * n + 1
```
Substituting `r` as `a[1]` and `n` as 2, we get:
```python
(a[1] - 1) * 2 + 1
```

### Output:
The output will be the result of the expression `(a[1] - 1) * 2 + 1`, where `a[1]` is the second element of the sorted list `a`.

Output: **(a[1] - 1) * 2 + 1 (where a[1] is the second element of the sorted list a)**
