Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer obtained from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `r` is the first element of the list `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`.**
