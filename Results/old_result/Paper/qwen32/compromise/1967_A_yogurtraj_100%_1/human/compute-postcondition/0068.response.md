The code snippet `r = a[i + 1]` directly assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to `r`. Given that `i` is 2, `r` will now hold the value of `a[3]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is either `k % (i + 1)` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, or 0 otherwise, `y` is either `n - 1 - i` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, or 0 otherwise, and `r` is `a[3]`, and `k` is `k - 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`, `i` is 2**.
