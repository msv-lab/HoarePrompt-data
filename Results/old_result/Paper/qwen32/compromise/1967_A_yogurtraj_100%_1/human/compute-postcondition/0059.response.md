Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `r` is `a[i + 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to `a[i + 1]`. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
