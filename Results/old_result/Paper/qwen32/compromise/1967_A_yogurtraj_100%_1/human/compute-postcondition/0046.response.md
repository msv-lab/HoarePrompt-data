The given Python code snippet sorts the list `a`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `ii`, `n`, `k`, `rem`, `y`, or `r`. The only variable that changes is `a`, which becomes a sorted version of its original list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0. If `k` is not equal to 0, then `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`. Otherwise, `r` is the last element of the list `a`.**
