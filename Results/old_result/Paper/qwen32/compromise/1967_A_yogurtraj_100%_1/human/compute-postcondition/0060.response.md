Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is either `k % (i + 1)` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, or 0 otherwise, `y` is either `n - 1 - i` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, or 0 otherwise, and `r` is either `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, or `a[i + 1]` otherwise, and `k` is either 0 if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, or `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` otherwise.**
