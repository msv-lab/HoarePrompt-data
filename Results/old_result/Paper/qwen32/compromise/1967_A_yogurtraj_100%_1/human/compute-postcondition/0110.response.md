The given code snippet updates the value of `k` by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from it. The other variables are not affected directly by this operation.

Given that `i` is 3, the expression becomes `k -= (3 + 1) * (a[4] - a[3])` which simplifies to `k -= 4 * (a[4] - a[3])`.

Therefore, the value of `k` is updated, and the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is either 0 or `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is either 0 or `n - 1 - i`, and `r` is either `a[i + 1]` or `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. `i` is 3 and `k` is `k - 4 * (a[4] - a[3])`.**
