The code snippet sorts the list `a`. The values of `t`, `ii`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The list `a` is now sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.**
