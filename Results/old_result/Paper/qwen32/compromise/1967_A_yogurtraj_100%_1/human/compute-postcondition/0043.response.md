The only variable in the loop head is `ii`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `ii` is less than the integer value obtained from `input()`. At the end of the last iteration, `ii` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `ii` should be incremented by 1.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `rem`, `y`, and `r`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0. If `k` is not equal to 0, then `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`. Otherwise, `r` is the last element of the list `a`.**
