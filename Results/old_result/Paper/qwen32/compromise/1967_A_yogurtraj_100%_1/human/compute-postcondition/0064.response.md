The code snippet `y = n - 1 - i` assigns a new value to the variable `y`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so the new value of `y` will be `n - 1 - 2`, which simplifies to `n - 3`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is `k % 3`, `y` is `n - 3`, `r` is `a[2] + k // 3`, `k` is either 0 if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, or `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` otherwise, `i` is 2.**
