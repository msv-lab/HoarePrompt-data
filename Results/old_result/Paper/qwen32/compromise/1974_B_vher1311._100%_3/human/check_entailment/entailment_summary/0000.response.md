Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to decode a string that was encoded using the specified algorithm. The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself. It then uses a function `func_1` to decode the string.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input in one go and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes each test case one by one.

2. **Finding the Auxiliary String `r`**: For each encoded string `b`, the program creates the auxiliary string `r` by taking all unique characters from `b`, sorting them alphabetically, and joining them into a single string. This matches the description of how the auxiliary string `r` is constructed during encoding.

3. **Creating the Mapping**: The program creates a dictionary `mapping` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second to the second last, and so on). This is the reverse of the mapping used during encoding.

4. **Decoding the String**: The program then decodes the encoded string `b` by replacing each character with its corresponding character from the `mapping` dictionary. This effectively reverses the encoding process.

5. **Output**: The decoded strings for all test cases are collected and printed, each on a new line.

The execution summary provided indicates that the function correctly processes the input strings and returns the decoded strings, which aligns with the expected behavior based on the problem description.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
