Postcondition: **`ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not equal to 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`. `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `x`. `r` is either `[0, 0]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 0]` or `[0, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` depending on the conditions. `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, and `a` is not equal to 1.**
