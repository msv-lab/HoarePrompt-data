The provided code snippet only includes `n = int(input())`, which reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This does not affect any of the variables `ax`, `bx`, `cx`, or `r` mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ax` is the smallest value from constraints of type 2, `bx` is the largest value from constraints of type 1, `cx` is a set of all unique values from constraints of type 3, and `r` is either `[0, 0]` or `[ax - bx + 1 - tmp, 0]` or `[0, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]` or `[ax - bx + 1 - tmp, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]` depending on the conditions, `n` is an input integer.**
