The code snippet appends a calculated value to the list `r`. The value being appended is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `r` is a list containing the single element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was 1, `cx` is a set of all `x` values encountered when `a` was neither 1 nor 2, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, and `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive).**
