The code snippet `ax = min(x, ax)` updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `x`. Given that `ax` is initially 1000000007, the new value of `ax` will be the smaller of 1000000007 and `x`.

Output State: **`a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`, `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set, `r` is either `[0, 0]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 0]` or `[0, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` depending on the conditions, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is the second integer input, and `a` is not equal to 1.**

In simpler terms, `ax` is now the smaller value between its original value (1000000007) and the value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
