The code snippet `bx = max(x, bx)` updates the value of `bx` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `x`. Given that `bx` is initially `-1`, after this operation, `bx` will either remain `-1` if `x` is less than `-1`, or it will be updated to the value of `x` if `x` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

Since `x` is the second integer input, we do not have a specific value for `x` in the initial state, but we know that `bx` will be updated based on this comparison. The other variables (`ax`, `cx`, `r`, `n`, `a`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of the second integer input `x` and -1, `cx` is an empty set, `r` is either `[0, 0]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 0]` or `[0, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` depending on the conditions, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is 1.**
