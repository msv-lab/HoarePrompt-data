The code snippet initializes a set named `cx`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged. The set `cx` is now an empty set.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and `r` is an empty list; `cx` is an empty set.**
