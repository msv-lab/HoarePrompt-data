Output State: **`ax` is the smallest value from constraints of type 2, `bx` is the largest value from constraints of type 1, `cx` is a set of all unique values from constraints of type 3 and must contain at least one element, `r` remains unchanged as `[0]` or `[ax - bx + 1 - tmp]` depending on the initial conditions, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, and `tmp` is 2 if `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and `i` is less than or equal to `ax`; otherwise, `tmp` remains 1, `i` is the next element from `cx`.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `tmp` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged, including `ax`, `bx`, `cx`, `r`, and `i`. The condition for `tmp` to be 2 or 1 is based on whether `i` is between `bx` and `ax` inclusive.
