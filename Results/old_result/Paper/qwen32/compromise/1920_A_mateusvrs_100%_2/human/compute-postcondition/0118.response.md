The code snippet `cx.add(x)` modifies the set `cx` by adding the value of `x` to it. Given the initial state, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x` depending on the value of `a`. 

If `a` is 2, `cx` is initially an empty set. After executing `cx.add(x)`, `cx` will contain the value `x`.

If `a` is not 2, `cx` is initially a set containing `x`. After executing `cx.add(x)`, `cx` will still contain `x`, and there will be no change since sets do not allow duplicate elements.

The other variables (`a`, `x`, `ax`, `bx`, `r`, `n`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`a` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not equal to 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `r` is either `[0, 0]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 0]` or `[0, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` depending on the conditions, `n` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1.**
