The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in the set `cx` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the last element from `cx` that was processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be set to the next element in `cx`.

State: **`ax` is the smallest value from constraints of type 2, `bx` is the largest value from constraints of type 1, `cx` is a set of all unique values from constraints of type 3 and must contain at least one element, `r` remains unchanged as `[0]` or `[ax - bx + 1 - tmp]` depending on the initial conditions, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and `i` is less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is set to 2. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 1. `i` is the next element from `cx`.**

Since `i` was the last element processed from `cx`, for the loop to continue, `i` must be set to the next element in `cx`. Let's denote this next element as `next_i`.

State: **`ax` is the smallest value from constraints of type 2, `bx` is the largest value from constraints of type 1, `cx` is a set of all unique values from constraints of type 3 and must contain at least one element, `r` remains unchanged as `[0]` or `[ax - bx + 1 - tmp]` depending on the initial conditions, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and `i` is less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is set to 2. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 1. `i` is `next_i`, which is the next element from `cx`.**
