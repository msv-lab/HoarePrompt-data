Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of constraints. Each constraint is a pair `(a, x)` where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given constraints.**
