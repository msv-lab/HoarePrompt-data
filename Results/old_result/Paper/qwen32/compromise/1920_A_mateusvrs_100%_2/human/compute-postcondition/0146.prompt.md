Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case. No two constraints are the same (all pairs (a, x) are distinct). `r` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cx = set()
    ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
    bx = -1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, x = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1:
            bx = max(x, bx)
        elif a == 2:
            ax = min(x, ax)
        else:
            cx.add(x)
    if bx > ax:
        r.append(0)
    else:
        tmp = 0
        for i in cx:
            if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                tmp += 1
        r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was 1, and `cx` is a set of all `x` values encountered when `a` was neither 1 nor 2. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, `r` is a list containing the value 0. Otherwise, `r` is a list containing the single element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ax` is the smallest value from constraints of type 2, `bx` is the largest value from constraints of type 1, and `cx` is a set of all unique values from constraints of type 3. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, the list `r` is either `[0, 0]` or `[ax - bx + 1 - tmp, 0]`. If `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, the list `r` is `[0, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]` or `[ax - bx + 1 - tmp, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]` depending on the initial conditions, and `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ax` is the minimum of all `x` where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` where `a` is 3, `n` is 0, and `r` remains unchanged if `bx` is not greater than `ax`. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, `r` has an additional element 0 appended to it. Otherwise, `r` has an additional element equal to `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
