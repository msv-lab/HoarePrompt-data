Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `r` is an empty list, `a` is the first integer from the new input, `x` is the second integer from the new input. If `a` is equal to 2, then `ax` is the minimum of its previous value and `x`. Otherwise, `cx` is a set containing the value `x`.**
