The code snippet provided is `bx = max(x, bx)`. This line updates the value of `bx` to be the maximum of the current values of `x` and `bx`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `bx`, we will consider it as a variable that could have any value. The values of `n` and `a` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `a` is 1, `x` is an integer read from the input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`.**
