Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, `r` is an empty list, `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was 1, and `cx` is a set of all `x` values encountered when `a` was neither 1 nor 2. Additionally, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`. `tmp` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in cx:
    if i >= bx and i <= ax:
        tmp += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, `r` is an empty list, `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was 1, `cx` is a set of all `x` values encountered when `a` was neither 1 nor 2 such that `cx` must have at least one element, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, and `tmp` is incremented by 1 if `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, `r` is an empty list, `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was 1, `cx` is a set of all `x` values encountered when `a` was neither 1 nor 2 such that `cx` must have at least one element, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, and `i` is the next element in `cx`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, `r` is an empty list, `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was 1, `cx` is a set of all `x` values encountered when `a` was neither 1 nor 2 such that `cx` must have at least one element, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, and `i` is the next element in `cx`. If `i` is between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), `tmp` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
