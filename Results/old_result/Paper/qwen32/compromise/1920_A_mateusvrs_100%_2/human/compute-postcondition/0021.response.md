The code snippet `ax = min(x, ax)` updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `x`. Given the initial state, `ax` is initially set to `1000000007`. After executing the code, `ax` will be updated to the minimum of `1000000007` and `x`.

Since `x` is the second integer from the new input, and `ax` is initially `1000000007`, the new value of `ax` will be `x` if `x` is less than `1000000007`, otherwise, it will remain `1000000007`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, `r` is an empty list, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `1000000007`, `a` is the first integer from the new input, `x` is the second integer from the new input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` equals 1, otherwise `bx` is -1. If `a` equals 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `1000000007`. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `cx` is a set containing the value `x`.**
