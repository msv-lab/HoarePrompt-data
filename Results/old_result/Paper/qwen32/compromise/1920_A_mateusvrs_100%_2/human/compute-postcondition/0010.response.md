Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, `r` is an empty list, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `a` is the first integer from the input and `a` equals 1, `x` is the second integer from the input.**

In this output state, the value of `bx` has been updated to be the maximum of `x` and -1. All other variables retain their initial values.
