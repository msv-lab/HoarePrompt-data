Postcondition: **`ax` is the smallest value from constraints of type 2, `bx` is the largest value from constraints of type 1, and `cx` is a set of all unique values from constraints of type 3. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, the list `r` is either `[0, 0]` or `[ax - bx + 1 - tmp, 0]`. If `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, the list `r` is `[0, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]` or `[ax - bx + 1 - tmp, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]` depending on the initial conditions, and `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.**
