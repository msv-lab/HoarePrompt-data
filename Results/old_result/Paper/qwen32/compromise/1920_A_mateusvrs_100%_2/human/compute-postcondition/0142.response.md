Postcondition: **`ax` is the minimum of all `x` where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` where `a` is 3 and must contain at least one element, `r` remains the same as per its initial conditions, `n` is 0, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `i` is `i_new` where `i_new` is the next element in `cx`. If `bx <= i <= ax`, then `tmp` is 3. Otherwise, `tmp` is 2.**
