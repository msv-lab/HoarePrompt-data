The code snippet `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Since `cx` is initially a set containing the value `x`, after executing the code, `cx` will still contain the value `x`, but it will not change because sets do not allow duplicate elements. Therefore, the output state remains the same for `cx` as it was before the execution of the code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, `r` is an empty list, `ax` is 1000000007, `a` is the first integer from the new input, `x` is the second integer from the new input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` equals 1, otherwise `bx` is -1. If `a` equals 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `cx` is a set containing the value `x`.**
