### Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a string such that there are exactly `n` special characters, where a character is considered special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The given program attempts to solve this problem based on the parity of `n` (whether `n` is odd or even).

Here's the breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Odd `n`:**
   - The program correctly identifies that it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string of uppercase Latin letters, as special characters must come in pairs. Thus, if `n` is odd, the program outputs "NO". This is correct.

2. **Even `n`:**
   - When `n` is even, the program constructs a string using the pattern "110" repeated `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that each pair of "1"s contributes to two special characters, and the "0" acts as a separator, making the string valid.
   - The program then checks if the length of the resulting string is less than 200. If it is, the program outputs "YES" followed by the constructed string. If the length is 200 or more, it outputs "NO".
   - The constructed string using the pattern "110" will always be less than 200 for `n` up to 50, as the maximum length of the string would be `3 * (50 // 2) = 75`, which is well within the limit.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles both the cases where `n` is odd and where `n` is even, adhering to the problem's constraints and requirements. The constructed string for even `n` ensures that there are exactly `n` special characters and that the string length does not exceed 200.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The program correctly handles both odd and even values of `n` by outputting "NO" for odd `n` and constructing a valid string for even `n` using the pattern "110". The constructed string will always be within the length limit of 200 for the given constraints.
Correctness: **True**
