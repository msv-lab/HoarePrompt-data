You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains two integers n and k where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}. There are t test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
        
    #State: a series of numbers where each number is either `n` or `1` depending on the condition `n - k <= 1` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it prints `n` if `n - k` is less than or equal to 1, otherwise it prints `1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a set of islands connected by bridges, where Dominater can destroy up to `k` bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach starting from island 1. The goal is to determine the minimum number of islands Everule can visit if Dominater acts optimally.

### Key Observations:
1. **Initial Connectivity**: Initially, all islands are fully connected, meaning there's a path between any pair of islands.
2. **Dominater's Action**: Dominater can destroy up to `k` bridges. The optimal strategy for Dominater would be to disconnect as many islands as possible from island 1.
3. **Everule's Reach**: Everule starts on island 1 and can only visit islands that are still connected to island 1 after Dominater's actions.

### Strategy:
- If `k` is large enough to disconnect all islands except island 1, then Everule can only visit island 1. This happens when `k >= n - 1` because destroying `n - 1` bridges is enough to isolate island 1.
- If `k` is smaller than `n - 1`, then Everule can still visit some other islands. Specifically, Everule can visit `n - k` islands because each bridge destroyed reduces the number of reachable islands by 1, starting from `n` islands.

### Correctness of the Program:
The provided program correctly implements this logic:
- For each test case, it reads the number of islands `n` and the number of bridges Dominater can destroy `k`.
- It then checks if `n - k <= 1`. If true, this means that after destroying `k` bridges, either island 1 is isolated or there's only one other island left that can be reached, so the output is `1`.
- If `n - k > 1`, it means there are still multiple islands reachable from island 1 after destroying `k` bridges, so the output is `n - k`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of islands Everule can visit based on the optimal actions of Dominater.

Correctness: **True**
