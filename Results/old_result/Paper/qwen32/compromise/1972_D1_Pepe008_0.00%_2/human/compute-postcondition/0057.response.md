Let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state:

Initial State: 
- `i` is `i + 1` if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, otherwise `i` remains unchanged.
- `b` remains the same.
- `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.

Code Snippet:
```python
suma += x
```

Impact of the code:
- The value of `suma` is updated by adding the current value of `x` to it.

Variables that remain unchanged:
- `i`
- `b`

Updated Variables:
- `suma` is now `suma + x`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1` if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, otherwise `i` remains unchanged; `b` remains the same; `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`; `suma` is `suma + x`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
The value of `suma` is increased by the value of `x`. All other variables (`i`, `b`, and `x`) retain their original values as per the initial conditions.
