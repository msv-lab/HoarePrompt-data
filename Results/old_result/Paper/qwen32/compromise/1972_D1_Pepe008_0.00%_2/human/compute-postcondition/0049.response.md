The code snippet `suma += x` adds the value of `x` to the current value of `suma`. 

Given the initial state, `suma` was initially 0, and `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. After executing the code, `suma` will be updated to `0 + x`, which simplifies to `x`.

Therefore, the updated value of `suma` will be `x`, while all other variables retain their initial values or conditions.

Output State: **`suma` is `x`, `t` is `t + 1`, `info` is the new list of strings obtained from the latest input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 0, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, and `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0**.
