The code snippet calculates the value of `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, which means its value is unknown. Therefore, the value of `x` cannot be determined precisely without knowing `i`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `x`, and its value depends on `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `suma` is 0, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`**
