To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and accumulates results. Here's a breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. **Initialization**: The variable `T` represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the loop reads two integers `a` and `b`.
2. **Inner Loop**: For each `i` from 1 to `b`, it calculates `x` as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and adds `x` to `suma` if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.
3. **Output**: After processing all `i` values for a given `a` and `b`, it prints `suma - 1`.

The loop iterates `T` times, each time processing a different pair of `a` and `b` values. The state after each iteration involves updating `info`, `a`, `b`, and recalculating `suma`.

### Final Output State

After all `T` iterations, the final output state will be the results of each individual test case printed sequentially. Each result corresponds to the computed value of `suma - 1` for the respective `a` and `b` values.

### Output State Format

Since the problem specifies that the output state should be described in a specific format, we can summarize the final output state as follows:

- The loop processes `T` test cases.
- For each test case, it computes and prints `suma - 1`.

Given that the loop processes each test case independently and prints the result immediately after processing, the final output state is simply the sequence of results for each test case.

Thus, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **The sequence of results for each test case, where each result is the value of `suma - 1` computed for the respective `a` and `b` values.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is the series of numbers printed by the loop for each of the `T` test cases.
