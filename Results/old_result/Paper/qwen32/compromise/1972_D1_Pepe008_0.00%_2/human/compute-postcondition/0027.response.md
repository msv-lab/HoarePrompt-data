To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

Given:
- `suma` is 0
- `t` is incremented by 1 (though `t` is not used in the code snippet, it remains incremented)
- `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` must be at least 1
- The code snippet: `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`

From the code snippet, we see that `x` is being calculated based on the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the provided initial state. To proceed, we need to assume that `i` has some specific value, as it's required for the calculation.

Since `i` is not specified, let's assume `i` has a specific value, say `i = 1` for simplicity. This assumption allows us to compute `x`.

Let's calculate `x` assuming `i = 1`:

\[ x = (a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1 ** 2 + 1 \]
\[ x = (a - 1 * 0) // 1 + 1 \]
\[ x = a // 1 + 1 \]
\[ x = a + 1 \]

Thus, `x` is `a + 1`.

The variables `suma`, `t`, `info`, and `b` remain unchanged. The only new variable introduced is `x`, which is `a + 1`.

Output State: **`suma` is 0, `t` is incremented by 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `x` is `a + 1`**.
