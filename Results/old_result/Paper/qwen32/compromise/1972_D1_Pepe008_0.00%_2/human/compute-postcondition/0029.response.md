The code snippet `suma += x` adds the value of `x` to the current value of `suma`. Given the initial state, `suma` was 0, and `x` is defined as `a + 1`. After executing the code, `suma` will be equal to `x`, which is `a + 1`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`suma` is `a + 1`, `t` is incremented by 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `x` is `a + 1`, and `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0.**
