The code snippet `info = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `info`.

Given the initial state, `info` was previously a list of strings obtained from the input. After executing the code snippet, `info` is updated to a new list of strings obtained from the latest input.

Output State: **`suma` is the accumulated sum of all `x` values where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` for `i` from 1 to `b`; `t` is `t + 1`; `info` is the new list of strings obtained from the latest input; `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`; `b` remains the same.**
