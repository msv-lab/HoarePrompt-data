### Reasoning:
The original assessment provides a detailed analysis of the program and verifies its correctness through several test cases. The program calculates the number of valid ordered pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions using a specific formula. Here's a more systematic breakdown of the evaluation:

1. **Problem Recap**: The problem requires finding pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis**: The program iterates through each test case, reads the values of \(n\) and \(m\), and then calculates the number of valid pairs using a nested loop structure that has been optimized into a single loop with a specific formula.

3. **Formula Validation**: The formula used in the program is:
   ```python
   for i in range(1, b + 1):
       x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
       if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
           suma += x
   print(suma - 1)
   ```
   This formula seems to be derived from a deeper mathematical insight, possibly related to the properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the constraints of the problem. While the derivation isn't provided in the code, the formula appears to work correctly based on the test cases.

4. **Test Cases**: The program is tested against several test cases, including edge cases like \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\), and larger values up to \(10^6\). The program produces the expected output for all these cases.

5. **Annotations**: The annotations confirm the state of the program at key points, ensuring that the input is correctly parsed and the calculations are performed as intended.

6. **Conclusion**: Given that the program passes all the provided test cases and there are no apparent logical errors, the original assessment concludes that the program is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the thorough analysis and the successful validation through multiple test cases, the final evaluation is:

Final: **True**
