The code snippet creates a new list `new` which is a slice of the original list `a` starting from index `i` to the end of the list. This operation does not affect the original list `a` or any of its elements, nor does it change the values of `t`, `n`, or `check_all`. The only new variable introduced is `new`.

Given that `i` is an index such that `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, the new list `new` will start from the point where the list `a` stops being sorted in non-decreasing order.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order, and there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i - 1] > a[i]; `new` is a list of integers starting from `a[i]` to the end of `a`.**
