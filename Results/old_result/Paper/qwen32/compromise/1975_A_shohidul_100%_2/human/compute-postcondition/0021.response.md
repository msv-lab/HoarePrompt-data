To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6.
- `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order.
- If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i - 1] > a[i]`.
- Additional conditions about `check_all_new` and `new_all` are provided but are not directly related to the loop head.

The for loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means that `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k` (where `1 ≤ k < n`). For the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

Since `n` does not change throughout the iterations, it remains the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `check_all` remains unchanged.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

So, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

If we don't know the exact value of `k`, we can simply express the state as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.
