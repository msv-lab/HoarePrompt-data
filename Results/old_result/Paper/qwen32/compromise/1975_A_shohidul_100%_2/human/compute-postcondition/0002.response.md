The given code snippet `n = int(input())` changes the value of `n` to whatever integer is provided by the user input. The initial state specifies that `n` was already an integer between 2 and 50, but this value is overwritten by the new input.

Since the new value of `n` comes from user input, we cannot determine its exact value without knowing the input. However, we know it will still be an integer. The other variables `t` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the integer provided by user input; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6.**
