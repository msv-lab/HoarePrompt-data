Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer provided by user input; `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by user input where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6; `check_all` is `True` if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `check_all` is `False`; `_` is incremented by 1. If `check_all` is `True`, the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If `check_all` is `False` and `n` is greater than 1, `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop.**
