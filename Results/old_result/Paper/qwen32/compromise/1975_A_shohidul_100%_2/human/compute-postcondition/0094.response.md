Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
2. `n` is greater than 1.
3. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6.
4. `check_all` is `True` if `a` was sorted in non-decreasing order up to the point where `a[i-1] > a[i]`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`.
5. At the current index `i`, `a[i-1]` is greater than `a[i]`.
6. `_` is incremented by 1.
7. `new` is a list containing elements from `a[i:]`.
8. `check_all_new` is `True`.
9. `new_all` is `True`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `i`, `_`, `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all` do not affect the output of this specific print statement because it is explicitly printing the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
