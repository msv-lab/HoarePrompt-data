Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step-by-step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
   - `n`: An integer greater than 1.
   - `a`: A list of `n` integers, where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6.
   - `check_all`: A boolean value that is `True` if the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order up to the point where `a[i-1] > a[i]`, otherwise it is `False`.
   - `_`: This variable is incremented by 1, but it is not used in the print statement.
   - `i`: This variable is incremented by 1, but it is not used in the print statement.
   - `new`: A list containing elements from `a` starting at index `i` to the end of `a`.
   - `check_all_new`: A boolean value that is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`, otherwise it is `False`.
   - `new_all`: A boolean value that is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise it is `False`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

### Analysis:

- The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.
- The string `'YES'` is directly printed without any modification or evaluation of the variables.

### Conclusion:

The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, or `new_all`.

### Final Output:

Output: **YES**
