The code snippet `new = a[i:]` creates a new list `new` that contains all elements from index `i` to the end of the list `a`. Given that `i` is incremented by 1 before this line, `i` now holds the value of its previous value plus one.

Since the initial state specifies that `i` is incremented by 1, we need to consider that `i` has already been updated. Let's denote the previous value of `i` as `i_prev`. After the increment, `i` is `i_prev + 1`.

Thus, `new` will be a slice of the list `a` starting from index `i_prev + 1` to the end of the list `a`.

Given that the initial state does not specify the exact value of `i_prev`, we can only say that `i` is now `i_prev + 1`, and `new` is `a[i:]` which means `a[i_prev + 1:]`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by user input where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6; `i` is `i_prev + 1`; `new` is `a[i:]` which is `a[i_prev + 1:]`.**
