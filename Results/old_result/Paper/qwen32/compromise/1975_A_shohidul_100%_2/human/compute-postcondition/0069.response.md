Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by user input where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6; `i` is `i_prev + 1`; `new` is `a[i:]` which is `a[i_prev + 1:]`; `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`; `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of the condition `check_all_new and new_all`.**
