The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. The initial state provides details about the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
