The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. This means that the previous list stored in `a` is replaced with the new list provided by the user input.

The variables `t`, `check_all`, and `_` remain unchanged because they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the new integer provided by user input; `a` is a new list of `n` integers provided by user input where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6; `check_all` is `True` if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `check_all` is `False`; `_` is incremented by 1.**
