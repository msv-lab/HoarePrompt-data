To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the state was:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000;
- `n` is greater than 1;
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6;
- `_` is incremented by 1 (this variable seems to be unused in the context provided);
- `i` is `i + 1`;
- `check_all` is determined based on the condition `a[i-1] > a[i]` and the sorted order of `a` up to that point;
- `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting at index `i` to the end of `a`;
- `check_all_new` is determined based on whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`;
- `new_all` is determined based on whether `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Since the loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n-1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `t` remains the same (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000);
- `n` remains the same (greater than 1);
- `a` remains the same (list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6);
- `_` remains the same (incremented by 1, but not used in the loop head);
- `i` is incremented by 1 (from its current value).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6; `_` is incremented by 1; `i` is `i + 1`**.
