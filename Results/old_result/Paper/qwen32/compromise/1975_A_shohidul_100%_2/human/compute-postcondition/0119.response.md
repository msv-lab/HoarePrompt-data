Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6; `_` is incremented by 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index `i` to the end of the list; `check_all_new` is True if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`, otherwise False; `new_all` is True if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise False; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of whether `check_all_new` and `new_all` are True or False.**
