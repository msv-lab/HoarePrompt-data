To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `n` is an integer greater than 1
- `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by user input where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6
- `_` is incremented by 1 (though this variable is not relevant to the loop condition)
- If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then `check_all` is set to `False` and `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of `a`.
- If `new_all` is `True`, the program continues as specified in the if part; otherwise, `new_all` is `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, then `check_all` remains unchanged.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

In the previous iteration, `i` was used to compare `a[i - 1]` and `a[i]`. For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, as per the `range(1, n)` definition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `i` incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by user input where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6; `i` is incremented by 1; `check_all` remains unchanged unless the condition `a[i - 1] > a[i]` is met in the new iteration; `new_all` remains unchanged unless the condition `a[i - 1] > a[i]` is met in the new iteration.** 

Since we are only adjusting the state of objects in the loop head (`i` and `n`), and `n` does not change, the final state is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by user input where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6; `i` is incremented by 1.**
