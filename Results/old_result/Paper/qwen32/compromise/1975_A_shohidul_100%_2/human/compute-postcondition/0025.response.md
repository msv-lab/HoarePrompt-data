Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1,000,000.
- `check_all` is `False` because the list `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i`.
- `check_all_new` is a boolean value (`True` or `False`) indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`.
- `new_all` is a boolean value (`True` or `False`) indicating whether `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it is printing a hardcoded string.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
