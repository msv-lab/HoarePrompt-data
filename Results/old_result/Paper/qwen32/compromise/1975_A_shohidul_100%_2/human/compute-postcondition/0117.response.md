Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000. This variable represents the number of test cases, but it does not affect the current `print` statement.
2. **`n`**: An integer greater than 1. This represents the length of the list `a`.
3. **`a`**: A list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6.
4. **`_`**: Incremented by 1, but this variable is not used in the `print` statement.
5. **`i`**: `i` is `i + 1`, but the exact value of `i` is not specified, and it doesn't affect the `print` statement directly.
6. **`new`**: A list containing elements of `a` from index `i` to the end of the list.
7. **`check_all_new`**: A boolean value that is True if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`, otherwise False.
8. **`new_all`**: A boolean value that is True if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise False.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`.
- None of the variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, `new_all`) are used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string provided in the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
