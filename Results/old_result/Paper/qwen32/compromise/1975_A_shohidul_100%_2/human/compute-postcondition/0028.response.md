Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i`, `check_all_new` is either `True` or `False` depending on whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables remain unchanged except that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
