Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6; `check_all` is `True` if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order up to the point where `a[i-1] > a[i]`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`; `_` is incremented by 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting at index `i` to the end of `a`; `check_all_new` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`; `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables remain unchanged except that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
