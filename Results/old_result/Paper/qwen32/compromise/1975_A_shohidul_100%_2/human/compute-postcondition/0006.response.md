Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` is the integer provided by user input.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by user input where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6.
- `check_all` is `True`.
- The list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward. It prints the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `check_all`. There are no conditions or calculations that affect the output of this particular print statement.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
