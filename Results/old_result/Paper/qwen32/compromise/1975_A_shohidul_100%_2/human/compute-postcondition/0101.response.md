To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Here's the provided state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000;
- `n` is greater than 1;
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6;
- `check_all` is `True` if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order up to the point where `a[i-1] > a[i]`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`;
- `_` is incremented by 1;
- If `a[i-1] > a[i]`, then at the current index `i`, `a[i-1]` is greater than `a[i]` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.

The for loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value (let's call it `i_prev`). Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

The variable `n` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `t` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `a` remains the same.
- `check_all` remains the same.
- `_` remains the same (since it's not part of the loop head and its increment is not relevant to the loop condition).

The only change is in `i`, which is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6; `check_all` is `True` if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order up to the point where `a[i-1] > a[i]`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`; `_` is incremented by 1; `i` is `i_prev + 1`**.

Since `i_prev` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and we don't have a specific value for `i_prev`, we can generalize this to say that `i` is now `i + 1` from the previous iteration.

So the final state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6; `check_all` is `True` if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order up to the point where `a[i-1] > a[i]`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`; `_` is incremented by 1; `i` is `i + 1`**.
