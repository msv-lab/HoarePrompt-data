Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - This variable represents the number of test cases but does not affect the current print statement directly.

2. **`n`**: An integer greater than 1.
   - This variable indicates the length of the list `a`.

3. **`a`**: A list of `n` integers provided by user input.
   - Each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6.
   - The list `a` is strictly decreasing, i.e., `a[i - 1] > a[i]`.

4. **`check_all`**: A boolean variable that is set to `False` if `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order after the check.
   - Since `a` is strictly decreasing, `check_all` would indeed be `False`.

5. **`_`**: Incremented by 1.
   - The underscore `_` is typically used as a throwaway variable in Python, often to indicate that the loop variable is not used. Its incrementation does not affect the print statement.

6. **`new`**: A sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of `a`.
   - This sublist is derived from the original list `a` but its specific contents do not affect the print statement.

7. **`check_all_new`**: Set to `True`.
   - This variable is set to `True` but does not affect the print statement.

8. **`new_all`**: Set to `True`.
   - This variable is set to `True` but does not affect the print statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('YES')` statement directly prints the string `'YES'`. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state affect this print statement because it is a direct print of a constant string.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
