Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (This seems to indicate the number of test cases, but it doesn't affect the current print statement directly).
- `n` is an integer greater than 1 (This indicates the length of the list `a`).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by user input where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (This suggests a loop context, but it doesn't directly affect the current print statement).
- `new` is a list containing elements from index `i` to the end of `a` (This is derived from the list `a`).
- `check_all_new` is a boolean indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new` (This is a condition related to the elements of `a`).
- `new_all` is a boolean indicating whether `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order (This is another condition related to the elements of `a`).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward. It simply prints the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the string `'YES'`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **YES**
