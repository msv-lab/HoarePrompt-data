The code snippet reassigns the values of `Min` and `Max` based on the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `k`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` must be greater than `Min * Max + k`.
- `k` is an integer greater than 0.
- `rep` is 1.
- `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`.
- `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`.
- `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.

After executing the code snippet, `Min` and `Max` are recalculated as follows:
- `Min` becomes the minimum of `n // k` and `k`.
- `Max` becomes the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.

Since the initial state already defines `Min` and `Max` in terms of `n // k` and `k`, and the code snippet is recalculating them using the same expressions, the values of `Min` and `Max` remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` must be greater than `Min * Max + k`; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `rep` is 1; `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.**
