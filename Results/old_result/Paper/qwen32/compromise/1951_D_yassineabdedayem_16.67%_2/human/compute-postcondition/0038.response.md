The code snippet `rep += 1` increments the value of `rep` by 1. Given that the initial state specifies `rep` is 2, after executing the code, `rep` will be 3. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is 0 or greater; `rep` is 3; `number` is either 1 or 2; `tab` is either `['2', '1', '1']`, `['2', '1', '2']`, `['2', '3', '1']`, or `['2', '3', '2']`; `Min` is 1; `Max` is 2; `k` is either 0 or 1. If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `number` is 1 and `k` is 0. Otherwise, `number` is 2 and `k` is 1.**
