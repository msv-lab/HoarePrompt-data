The code snippet provided appends the string representation of the variable `number` to the list `tab`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `Min`, and `Max` remain unchanged, as they are not directly affected by the code.

The initial state specifies that `tab` is a list containing one element `str(number)`. After executing `tab.append(str(number))`, `tab` will now contain two elements: the original `str(number)` and the newly appended `str(number)`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` (and must still be greater than 0); `n` is `n + Min * Max`; `k` is `k - Max` if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, otherwise `k` is `k - Min` (and `k` is a positive integer and `k <= n`); `rep` is 1; `tab` is a list containing two elements `str(number)`; `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`; `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`; `number` is `Min` if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`.**

In simpler terms, the list `tab` now has two identical elements, both being the string representation of `number`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
