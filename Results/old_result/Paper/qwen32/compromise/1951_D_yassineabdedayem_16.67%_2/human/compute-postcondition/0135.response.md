Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` (and must still be greater than 0); `n` is the original value of `n` before the addition of `Min * Max` and `n >= k`; `k` is `k - Max` (and `k` is a positive integer and `k <= n`); `rep` is 2; `tab` is a list containing two elements `str(number)`; `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`; `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`; `number` is `Min`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated to `k - Max`. The values of `t`, `n`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`, and `number` remain unchanged.
