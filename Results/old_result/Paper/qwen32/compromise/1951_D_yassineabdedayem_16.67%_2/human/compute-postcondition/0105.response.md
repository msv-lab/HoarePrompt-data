The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, ensuring it remains greater than 0.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:
- `t` should be decremented by 1.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

State: **`t` is `t - 1` (and must still be greater than 0); `n` is a non-negative integer; `k` is a non-positive integer or 0; `rep` is an integer between 0 and 60; `tab` is a list of string representations of `number` for each completed iteration; `Min` and `Max` are the last computed values based on the final `n` and `k` before the loop terminated. If `k` is 0, all elements of `tab` have been printed separated by spaces.**
