The given initial state does not include any variable named `i`. The variables mentioned are `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `number`, `tab`, `Min`, and `Max`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, it is impossible to determine the value of `i` based on the provided information.

Given this, the `print(i, end=' ')` statement will result in a `NameError` because `i` is not defined. However, since the task is to determine what will be printed and we are instructed to use the given information, we must conclude that the value of `i` is unknown from the provided context.

Output: **NameError: name 'i' is not defined**
