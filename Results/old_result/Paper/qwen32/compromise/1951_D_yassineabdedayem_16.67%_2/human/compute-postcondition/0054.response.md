The code reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state of `n` and `k` is not relevant here as they are being overwritten. The values of `t`, `rep`, `number`, `tab`, `Min`, and `Max` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input; `rep` is 1; `number` is either 2 or 5; `tab` is either ['2'] or ['5']; `Min` is 2; `Max` is 5. If k is 0, the sequence 2 5 2 is executed. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `number`, `tab`, `Min`, and `Max` remain unchanged.**
