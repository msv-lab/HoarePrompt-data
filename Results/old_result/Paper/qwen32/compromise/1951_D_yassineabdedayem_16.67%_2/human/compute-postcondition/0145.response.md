Given the initial state, let's analyze the variables and the print statement step by step.

1. **Initial State Breakdown:**
   - `t` is `t - 1` and still greater than 0.
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `rep` is the number of iterations the loop ran (up to 60).
   - `tab` is a list of string representations of `number` for each iteration.
   - `Min` and `Max` are the last computed values based on the final `n` and `k` before the loop terminated.
   - `number` is the last computed value in the loop.
   - The current value of `k` is 0.

2. **Focus on the `tab` List:**
   - `tab` is a list that accumulates string representations of `number` for each iteration of the loop.
   - The number of iterations the loop ran is stored in `rep`, which is up to 60.

3. **Determine `len(tab)`:**
   - Since `tab` is populated with string representations of `number` for each iteration, the length of `tab` will be equal to the number of iterations the loop ran, which is `rep`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(len(tab))` statement will output the length of the `tab` list.
   - Given that `tab` has `rep` number of elements, `len(tab)` will be `rep`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(len(tab))` statement is the number of iterations the loop ran, which is `rep`.

Output: **rep (where rep is the number of iterations the loop ran)**
