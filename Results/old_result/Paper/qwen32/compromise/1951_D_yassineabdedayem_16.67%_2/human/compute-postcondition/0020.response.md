The code snippet updates the values of `Min` and `Max` based on the expressions `min(n // k, k)` and `max(int(n / k), k)`, respectively. Given the initial state, `n` is 3 and `k` is 3.

- `n // k` evaluates to `3 // 3`, which is `1`.
- `int(n / k)` evaluates to `int(3 / 3)`, which is `1`.

Thus, `Min` is updated to `min(1, 3)`, which is `1`, and `Max` is updated to `max(1, 3)`, which is `3`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `number`, and `tab` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is 3; `k` is 3; `rep` is 1; `number` is either 2 or 5; `tab` is either `['2']` or `['5']`; `Min` is 1; `Max` is 3**.
