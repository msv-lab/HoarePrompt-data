The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `Max` from it. Given that `k` is initially 2 and `Max` is 2, the new value of `k` will be `2 - 2 = 0`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `rep`, `number`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` must be 2 or greater; `rep` is 2; `number` is 1; `tab` is either `['2', '1']` or `['2', '3']`; `Min` is 1; `Max` is 2; `k` is 0.**
