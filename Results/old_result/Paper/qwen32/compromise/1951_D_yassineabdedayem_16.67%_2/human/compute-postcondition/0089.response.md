Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is a positive value equal to the previous `n` minus `Min * Max`; `k` is either `k - Max` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, or `k - Min` otherwise; `rep` is 3; `tab` is a list containing three string representations of `number`; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`; `number` is `Min` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`.**

In simpler terms, the only change is that the variable `rep` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. All other variables remain unchanged with their previous values and conditions.
