The code snippet reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The initial state of `n` and `k` is not specified, but after the execution of the code, `n` and `k` will hold the values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` (and must still be greater than 0); `n` is the first integer read from the input; `k` is the second integer read from the input; `rep` is an integer between 0 and 60; `tab` is a list of string representations of `number` for each completed iteration; `Min` and `Max` are the last computed values based on the final `n` and `k` before the loop terminated. If `k` is 0, all elements of `tab` have been printed separated by spaces.**
