The code snippet `tab = []` reassigns the variable `tab` to an empty list. This means that the previous list stored in `tab` is discarded, and `tab` now holds an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` (and must still be greater than 0); `n` is the first integer read from the input; `k` is the second integer read from the input; `rep` is 0; `tab` is an empty list; `Min` and `Max` are the last computed values based on the final `n` and `k` before the loop terminated; `number` is 0.**
