The code appends the string representation of `number` to the list `tab`. Given the initial conditions, `number` can be either 2 or 5. Therefore, `tab` will contain either `['2']` or `['5']`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Specifically:
- `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is 10.
- `k` is either 0 or 3.
- `rep` is 0.
- `Min` is 2.
- `Max` is 5.
- The relationship between `k` and `number` based on the conditions provided remains the same.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is 10; `k` is either 0 or 3; `rep` is 0; `number` is either 2 or 5; `tab` is either `['2']` or `['5']`; `Min` is 2; `Max` is 5. If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is 0 and `number` is 2. Otherwise, `k` is 3 and `number` is 5.**
