The code snippet `n -= Min * Max` modifies the value of `n` by subtracting the product of `Min` and `Max` from it. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this operation, which they are not in this case.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t - 1` and must still be greater than 0.
- `n` is the original value of `n` before the addition of `Min * Max` and `n >= k`.
- `k` is `k - Max` if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, otherwise `k` is `k - Min` (and `k` is a positive integer and `k <= n`).
- `rep` is 2.
- `tab` is a list containing three elements `str(number)`, `str(number)`, `str(number)`.
- `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`.
- `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`.
- `number` is `Min` if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`.

After executing `n -= Min * Max`, the value of `n` is reduced by `Min * Max`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must still be greater than 0; `n` is the original value of `n` minus `Min * Max` and `n - Min * Max >= k`; `k` is `k - Max` if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, otherwise `k` is `k - Min` (and `k` is a positive integer and `k <= n - Min * Max`); `rep` is 2; `tab` is a list containing three elements `str(number)`, `str(number)`, `str(number)`; `Min` is `min((n - Min * Max) // k, k)`; `Max` is `max(int((n - Min * Max) / k), k)`; `number` is `Min` if `Max == k and (n - Min * Max) * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`.**

In simpler terms:
- `t` remains `t - 1` and is still greater than 0.
- `n` is reduced by `Min * Max` and remains greater than or equal to `k`.
- `k` is adjusted based on the conditions provided, and it remains a positive integer and less than or equal to the new `n`.
- `rep` remains 2.
- `tab` remains unchanged as a list of three string representations of `number`.
- `Min` and `Max` are recalculated based on the new value of `n`.
- `number` is recalculated based on the new `Min` and `Max` values and the conditions provided.
