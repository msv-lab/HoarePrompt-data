Given the initial state, let's break down the variables and their values:

- `t` is `t - 1` and still greater than 0, indicating that `t` was decremented by 1 but is still positive.
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is 0.
- `rep` is the number of iterations the loop ran (up to 60).
- `tab` is a list of string representations of `number` for each iteration and must have at least three elements.
- `Min` and `Max` are the last computed values based on the final `n` and `k` before the loop terminated.
- `number` is the last computed value in the loop.
- The current value of `k` is 0.
- `i` is the next element in `tab`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

Since `i` is described as the next element in `tab`, and `tab` is a list of string representations of `number` for each iteration, `i` will be the next string in this list. However, the exact value of `i` cannot be determined without knowing the specific elements of `tab`, but we know it is a string representation of `number` from one of the iterations.

Given the information provided, the output will be the string representation of `number` from the next element in `tab`, followed by a space due to `end=' '`.

Output: **i (where i is the next element in the tab list, a string representation of number from one of the iterations)**
