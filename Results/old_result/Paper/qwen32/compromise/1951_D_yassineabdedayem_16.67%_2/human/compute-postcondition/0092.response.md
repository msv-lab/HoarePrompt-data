The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, or `Max`. The string 'YES' is explicitly provided in the print statement, so it will be printed exactly as given, regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **YES**
