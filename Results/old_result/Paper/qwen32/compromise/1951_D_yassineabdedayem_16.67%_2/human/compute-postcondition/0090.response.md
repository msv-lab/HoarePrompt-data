To determine the final output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop terminates. The loop continues as long as `n != 0`, `k > 0`, `rep < 60`, and `n >= k`. 

Given the initial state and the conditions for the first three iterations, we can infer how the variables change with each iteration. The loop modifies `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, and `Max` based on the logic inside the loop.

Let's walk through the process:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t > 0`
   - `n` and `k` are integers read from input
   - `rep = 0`
   - `number = 0`
   - `tab = []`
   - `Min = 2`
   - `Max = 5`
   - If `k == 0`, the sequence 2 5 2 is executed; otherwise, the values remain unchanged.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - **First Iteration**:
     - `Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)`
     - `number = Max` if `Max != k` or `n * Min > k`; otherwise, `number = Min`
     - `k = k - Min` if `Max != k` or `n * Min > k`; otherwise, `k = k - Max`
     - `tab.append(str(number))`
     - `n -= Min * Max`
     - `rep += 1`
   - **Subsequent Iterations**: The same logic applies, updating `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, and `Max` accordingly.

3. **Termination Conditions**:
   - The loop will terminate when any of the following conditions are met:
     - `n == 0`
     - `k <= 0`
     - `rep >= 60`
     - `n < k`

Given that the output states after the first three iterations are provided, we can infer that the loop continues until one of the termination conditions is met. The specific values of `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, and `Max` at the end will depend on the initial values of `n` and `k`.

Since the problem does not specify the initial values of `n` and `k`, we can only provide a general description of the final state:

- **Final Output State**:
  - `t > 0` (unchanged from the initial state)
  - `n` will be a non-negative integer (possibly 0 if the loop terminates due to `n == 0`)
  - `k` will be a non-positive integer or 0 (if the loop terminates due to `k <= 0`)
  - `rep` will be an integer between 0 and 60, inclusive (the exact value depends on how many iterations were completed)
  - `tab` will be a list of string representations of `number` for each iteration that was completed
  - `Min` and `Max` will be the last computed values based on the final `n` and `k` before the loop terminated

Given the provided information, we can't determine the exact final values of `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, and `Max` without the initial values of `n` and `k`. However, we can describe the final state in a general form.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is a non-negative integer (possibly 0); `k` is a non-positive integer or 0; `rep` is an integer between 0 and 60; `tab` is a list of string representations of `number` for each completed iteration; `Min` and `Max` are the last computed values based on the final `n` and `k` before the loop terminated.**
