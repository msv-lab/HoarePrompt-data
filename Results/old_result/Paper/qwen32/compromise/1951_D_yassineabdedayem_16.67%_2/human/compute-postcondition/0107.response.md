Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` (and must still be greater than 0); `n` is the first integer read from the input; `k` is the second integer read from the input; `rep` is 0; `tab` is a list of string representations of `number` for each completed iteration; `Min` and `Max` are the last computed values based on the final `n` and `k` before the loop terminated. If `k` is 0, all elements of `tab` have been printed separated by spaces.**

The variable `rep` has been set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
