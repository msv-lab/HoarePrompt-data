The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the elements of the list `tab`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state of `i` and the list `tab`.

Given:
- `t` is greater than 0 (this variable is not directly involved in the loop head and thus does not need adjustment).
- `n` is a non-negative integer (this variable is not directly involved in the loop head and thus does not need adjustment).
- `k` is 0 (this variable is not directly involved in the loop head and thus does not need adjustment).
- `rep` is an integer between 0 and 60 (this variable is not directly involved in the loop head and thus does not need adjustment).
- `tab` is a list of string representations of `number` for each completed iteration and must have at least two elements.
- `Min` and `Max` are the last computed values based on the final `n` and `k` before the loop terminated (these variables are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need adjustment).

Since `i` is currently iterating over `tab`, and at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been the last element of `tab`, the next iteration would start with `i` being the first element of `tab` again if the loop were to restart. However, since we are considering the next iteration of the current loop, `i` would be the next element in `tab` after the last one.

Given that `tab` must have at least two elements, let's denote the elements of `tab` as `tab[0]` and `tab[1]`. If `i` was `tab[0]` in the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `i` would be `tab[1]`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0, `rep` is an integer between 0 and 60, `tab` is a list of string representations of `number` for each completed iteration and must have at least two elements, `Min` and `Max` are the last computed values based on the final `n` and `k` before the loop terminated, `i` is `tab[1]`**
