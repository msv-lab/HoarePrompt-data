To determine the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, let's analyze the given code and the logic it follows:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Logic Inside the Loop:**
   - If `k` is equal to 1, it prints `1` and moves to the next test case.
   - If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, it prints the ceiling of `k / 2`.
   - If `k` is greater than `2 * n`, it prints `k // 2 + 1`.

3. **Output State:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program will have printed a series of numbers corresponding to the results of each test case.
   - The state of the program after the loop ends would be that all test cases have been processed, and the program is ready to terminate.

4. **Variables Affected:**
   - The variables `n` and `k` are re-assigned for each test case inside the loop.
   - The variable `t` is used to control the loop and is decremented implicitly by the loop structure.

Since the program's primary function is to print the results for each test case, the final output state will be a series of printed numbers corresponding to the results of each test case. The variables `n` and `k` will not retain any specific value after the loop, as they are reassigned during each iteration. The variable `t` will be `0` after the loop completes, as it controls the number of iterations.

**Output State:** **A series of printed numbers corresponding to the results of each test case, with the variable `t` being 0 and `n` and `k` not retaining any specific value.**
