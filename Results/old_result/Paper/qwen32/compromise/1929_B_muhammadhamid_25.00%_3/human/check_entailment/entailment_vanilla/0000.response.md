Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total in an \( n \times n \) grid.

### Key Observations
1. **Diagonals in the Grid**:
   - There are \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals running from the top-left to bottom-right.
   - There are \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals running from the top-right to bottom-left.
   - Total diagonals = \( 4n - 2 \).

2. **Coloring Strategy**:
   - To minimize the number of colored cells while ensuring that \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell, we need to strategically place the colored cells.
   - If \( k \leq 2n \), we can cover \( k \) diagonals by coloring cells on the main diagonals (top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left). This is because each cell on the main diagonals can cover two diagonals (one from each set).
   - If \( k > 2n \), we need to color additional cells to cover the remaining diagonals. This is because the main diagonals can only cover up to \( 2n - 2 \) diagonals when considering overlaps.

### Mathematical Formulation
- For \( k \leq 2n \), the minimum number of cells required is \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \). This is because each cell can cover at most two diagonals.
- For \( k > 2n \), the minimum number of cells required is \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \). This accounts for the fact that we need to cover more diagonals beyond the main diagonals.

### Program Analysis
The provided program follows the above logic:

```python
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)

func()
```

- The program first handles the special case where \( k = 1 \), which requires only one cell.
- For \( k \leq 2n \), it calculates the minimum number of cells using \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).
- For \( k > 2n \), it calculates the minimum number of cells using \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \).

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the strategy to find the minimum number of cells needed to color at least \( k \) diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
