Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `f` is the second integer from the new input, `k` is the third integer from the new input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`, `greater_count` is the total number of elements in the new list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, and `_` is incremented by 1. If `value` equals `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` is set to 1. Otherwise, `same_value_count` remains 0. `value` is the next element in the list `a` that has not yet been processed, `same_value_count` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the only change is that `same_value_count` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values.
