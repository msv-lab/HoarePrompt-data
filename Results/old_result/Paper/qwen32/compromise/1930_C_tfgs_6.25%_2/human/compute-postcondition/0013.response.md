The code snippet initializes an empty list `ans`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, `counter`, or `cnt`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `counter` is a `Counter` object where each unique element in `a` has a count of 1, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty list.**
