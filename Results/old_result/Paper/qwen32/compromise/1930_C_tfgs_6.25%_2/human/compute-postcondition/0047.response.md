The only variable in the loop head is `j` and `adv`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `adv`. If `j` is less than `adv`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` should be one more than its previous value. `adv` must remain the same for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i`, `i` is `i + 1`, `adv` must be greater than 0, `ans` contains an additional element `n - i - j`, `j` is `j + 1`**
