Let's break down the initial state and the variables to understand what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`n`**: An integer greater than 0.
2. **`a`**: A list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i`. This means `a` will be `[n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1, 0]`.
3. **`counter`**: A `Counter` object where each unique element in `a` has a count of 0. Since all elements in `a` are unique, `counter` will have keys from `0` to `n` with all counts set to `0`.
4. **`cnt`**: An integer initialized to `0`.
5. **`ans`**: A sorted list of integers from `n-1` down to `0` followed by `-1, -2, ..., -cnt`. Given `cnt` is `0`, the part after `0` is empty.

### Calculation of `ans`:
- The first part of `ans` is a sorted list of integers from `n-1` down to `0`. This will be `[n-1, n-2, ..., 1, 0]`.
- Since `cnt` is `0`, the part after `0` is empty.

Thus, `ans` will be `[n-1, n-2, ..., 1, 0]`.

### Print Statement:
The `print(*ans)` statement will unpack the `ans` list and print each element separated by a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **n-1 n-2 ... 1 0** (where the sequence is from `n-1` down to `0`)

To make it more precise and clear, let's format it:
Output: **n-1, n-2, ..., 1, 0** (where the sequence is from `n-1` down to `0`)
