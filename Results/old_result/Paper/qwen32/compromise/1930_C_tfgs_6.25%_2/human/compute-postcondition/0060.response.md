The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `cnt`. Since the loop iterates `cnt` times, and we are at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `cnt` to reflect the remaining iterations.

Given that `cnt` is greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` should be decremented by 1.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:
- `cnt` should be decremented by 1.

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `counter`, `ans`) are not part of the loop head and thus should remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i`, `counter` is a `Counter` object where each unique element in `a` has a count of 0, `cnt` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `ans` is a sorted list of integers from `n-1` down to `0` with an additional element `-1` at the end**.

To be more precise and clear:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i`, `counter` is a `Counter` object where each unique element in `a` has a count of 0, `cnt` is `cnt - 1`, `ans` is a sorted list of integers from `n-1` down to `0` with an additional element `-1` at the end**.
