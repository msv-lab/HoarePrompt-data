The code snippet `ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)` appends a new element to the list `ans`. This new element is the last element of `ans` minus 1. 

Given the initial state, `ans` is a sorted list of integers from `n-1` down to `0` with an additional element `-1` at the end. Therefore, `ans[-1]` is `-1`. Subtracting 1 from `-1` results in `-2`.

So, the new element `-2` is appended to `ans`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i`, `counter` is a `Counter` object where each unique element in `a` has a count of 0, `cnt` is `cnt - 1`, `ans` is a sorted list of integers from `n-1` down to `0` with an additional element `-1` at the end and an additional element `-2` at the end**.
