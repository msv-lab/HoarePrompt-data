The code `ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)` appends a new element to the list `ans`, which is one less than the last element of `ans`. Given that `ans` is initially a sorted list of integers from `n-1` down to `0`, the last element of `ans` is `0`. Therefore, the new element appended will be `-1`.

Hereâ€™s the updated output state:
- `n` is still greater than 0.
- `a` is still a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i`.
- `counter` is still a `Counter` object where each unique element in `a` has a count of 0.
- `cnt` is still greater than 0.
- `ans` is now a sorted list of integers from `n-1` down to `0` with an additional element `-1` at the end.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i`, `counter` is a `Counter` object where each unique element in `a` has a count of 0, `cnt` is greater than 0, `ans` is a sorted list of integers from `n-1` down to `0` with an additional element `-1` at the end.**
