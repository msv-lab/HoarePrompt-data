Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the `i`-th element is `n - i`, `adv` is greater than 0 if `i` is greater than 0, `ans` contains `adv` elements calculated as `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` from 0 to `adv - 1` plus the element `a[i]`, `cnt` is decreased by `adv`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decreased by `adv` if `i` is greater than 0.**

In simpler terms, the list `ans` now includes an additional element `a[i]`. All other variables retain their previous states unless `i` is greater than 0, in which case `cnt` and `counter[a[i - 1]]` are also updated as described.
