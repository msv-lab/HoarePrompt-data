### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n`.
   - We have an empty set `S`.

2. **Operations:**
   - Perform the following operation `n` times:
     1. Select an index `i` such that `1 ≤ i ≤ |a|`.
     2. Insert `a_i + i` into `S`. (Note `S` is a set, so no duplicates will be inserted.)
     3. Delete `a_i` from `a`.

3. **Result Construction:**
   - Construct a new array `b` which is `S` sorted in decreasing order.
   - The goal is to find the lexicographically largest possible `b`.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Transformation:**
   - The program modifies the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to `a_i` for each index `i` (0-based in the code).
   - This is equivalent to `a_i + (i + 1)` in the problem statement (1-based index).

3. **Counting and Sorting:**
   - It uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each element in the modified `a`.
   - It converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates, sorts this set in decreasing order, and stores it in `a`.

4. **Constructing `ans`:**
   - It initializes an empty list `ans`.
   - It iterates through the sorted unique elements of `a` (from largest to smallest).
   - For each element, it inserts duplicates of the previous element (if any) before inserting the current element. The number of duplicates inserted is determined by the difference between the current and previous element, the remaining count `cnt`, and the count of the previous element in `counter`.
   - It then appends the current element to `ans` and decrements its count in `counter`.

5. **Handling Remaining Duplicates:**
   - After processing all unique elements, it appends additional elements to `ans` if there are still remaining duplicates (`cnt > 0`).

6. **Output:**
   - It prints the constructed `ans` for each test case.

#### Correctness:

The program correctly transforms the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element, ensuring that the elements inserted into `S` are correct. It then constructs the lexicographically largest `b` by sorting the unique elements in decreasing order and inserting duplicates appropriately. The use of `Counter` helps in managing the counts of elements, ensuring that no duplicates are inserted into the set `S`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically largest `b` for each test case.

**Correctness: **True**
