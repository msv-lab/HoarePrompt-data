Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the code does not guarantee that the lexicographically largest array `b` is produced because it does not consider the optimal selection of indices `i` to maximize the values inserted into the set `S`.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Selection of Indices:**
   - The code simply adds `a[i] + i + 1` for each `i` in the range of `n` and then sorts the unique values in descending order. This does not ensure that the lexicographically largest `b` is produced because it does not consider the optimal sequence of index selections.

2. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - The code uses a `Counter` to handle duplicates and tries to fill in missing values between consecutive unique elements. However, this approach does not guarantee the lexicographically largest `b` because it does not consider the optimal way to insert values into the set `S` by selecting indices `i` in a specific order.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3
6 4 8
```
The correct output should be:
```
11 7 6
```
However, the provided code will produce:
```
11 8 7
```
This is because the code does not consider the optimal sequence of index selections to maximize the values inserted into the set `S`. Specifically, the code does not ensure that the largest possible values are inserted first, which is necessary to produce the lexicographically largest `b`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, one should consider the following strategy:
1. **Sort the Array with Indices:**
   - Sort the array `a` in such a way that the elements are paired with their indices and then sorted in decreasing order of `a[i] + i`.

2. **Insert into Set:**
   - Insert the values `a[i] + i` into the set `S` in the sorted order to ensure that the largest possible values are inserted first.

3. **Construct the Result:**
   - Convert the set `S` to a list and sort it in decreasing order to form the array `b`.

By following this approach, one can ensure that the lexicographically largest `b` is produced for every test case.
