Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The program sorts the array and then counts the number of occurrences of the median element, but it does not perform any operations to actually increase the median.

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many elements need to be incremented to make the median larger than its current value. Here's a correct approach:

1. Sort the array.
2. Identify the current median.
3. Calculate the number of operations needed to make the median larger than its current value.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        current_median = a[p]
        
        # Find the next largest unique element in the sorted array
        next_median = current_median + 1
        count = 0
        for i in range(p, n):
            if a[i] < next_median:
                count += next_median - a[i]
            else:
                break
        
        print(count)

func()
```

This program correctly identifies the current median and calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase it by finding the next largest unique element and determining how many increments are needed to make all elements up to the median position at least as large as this next largest element.
