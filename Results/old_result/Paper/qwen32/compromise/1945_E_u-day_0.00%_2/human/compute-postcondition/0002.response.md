The code snippet provided simply initializes the variable `pos` to -1. The values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state will retain the values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` as they were initially returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, with the addition of `pos` being set to -1.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is -1**.
