Let's analyze the given program and its behavior based on the problem description and the function summary provided. We'll also evaluate the original assessment to determine if it is accurate.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires calculating the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts, where each yogurt costs `a` burles individually, or two yogurts can be bought for `b` burles as a promotion.

### Program Code Analysis
Here's the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)
```

### Function Summary Analysis
The function summary correctly describes the logic:
- For odd `n`, it checks if buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying them individually. If not, it buys as many pairs as possible and pays the regular price for the remaining yogurt.
- For even `n`, it similarly checks if the promotion price is cheaper and calculates the cost accordingly.

### Original Assessment Analysis
The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect due to the unreachable `elif` block when `n` is even. However, let's verify this by analyzing the logic:

1. **Odd `n`**:
    - If `2 * a < b`, then buying individual yogurts is cheaper, and the program correctly prints `a * n`.
    - Otherwise, it buys `n // 2` pairs and pays `a` for the remaining yogurt, which is correct.

2. **Even `n`**:
    - If `2 * a < b`, the program correctly prints `a * n`.
    - Otherwise, it correctly prints `(n // 2) * b`.

The `elif` block is indeed unreachable because the condition `2 * a < b` is already checked in the `if` block. However, the program logic is correct for all cases, including when `n` is 1. 

The original assessment incorrectly states that the logic is incorrect for even `n` due to the unreachable `elif` block, which is not a logical error. The `elif` block can be removed for simplicity, but it does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is inaccurate because the program's logic is correct for all cases, and the unreachable `elif` block does not affect the correctness of the output.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
