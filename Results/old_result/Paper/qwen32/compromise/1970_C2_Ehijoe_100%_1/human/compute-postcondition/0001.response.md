Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing the neighboring nodes, `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= `start` <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree, `n` is the first input integer, `t` is the second input integer, `edges` is an empty list.**

In simple terms: The `edges` list has been initialized as an empty list, while all other variables retain their initial values.
