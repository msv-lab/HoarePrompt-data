Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `nodes`, a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing the neighboring nodes, and `start`, an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The function returns a list of nodes in the order they are visited starting from the `start` node.**
