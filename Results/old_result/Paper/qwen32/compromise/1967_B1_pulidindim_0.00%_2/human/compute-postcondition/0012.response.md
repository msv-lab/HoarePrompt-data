The code snippet `ans += g / count + 1` modifies the value of `ans` by adding the result of `g / count + 1` to it. Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `i` remains 0.
- `n` remains the first integer from the input.
- `m` remains at least 2.
- `count` remains 2.
- `ans` is now equal to its previous value plus `g / count + 1`, which translates to `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1`.
- `countmins` remains 1.
- `g` remains `n / 2 - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n / 2 - 1`.**
