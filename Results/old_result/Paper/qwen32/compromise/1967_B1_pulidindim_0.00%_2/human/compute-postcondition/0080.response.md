Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is at least 3, `count` is 3, `countmins` is 2, `g` is `n / count`, `ans` is `n + (g / count + 1)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `count`, `countmins`, `g`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that the program will exit the most internal loop or if statement.
