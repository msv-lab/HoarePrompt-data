The code snippet `ans += g / count + 1` modifies the value of `ans` by adding `g / count + 1` to its current value. Given the initial state, `ans` is initially `n + (g / count + 1)`. After the operation, `ans` becomes `n + (g / count + 1) + (g / count + 1)`, which simplifies to `n + 2 * (g / count + 1)`.

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `count`, `countmins`, `g`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is at least 3, `count` is 3, `countmins` is 2, `g` is `n / count - 2`, `ans` is `n + 2 * (g / count + 1)`**.
