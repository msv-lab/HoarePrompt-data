Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is at least 3, `count` is 3, `countmins` is 2, `g` is `n / count`, `ans` is `n + (g / count + 1)`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
