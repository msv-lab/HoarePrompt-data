Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2 · 10^6. The sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    count = 2
    ans = n
    while count <= m:
        countmins = count - 1
        g = n / count
        if g < countmins:
            break
        g -= countmins
        ans += g / count + 1
        count += 1
    print(int(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `count` is `m + 1` if the loop runs until `count` exceeds `m`, `ans` is the accumulated value after all valid iterations, `countmins` is `count - 1`, and `g` is `n / count - countmins`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks before `count` reaches `m + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, i is 1, n is the first integer from the input, m is the second integer from the input, count is count_final, countmins is count_final - 1, g is n / count_final - count_final + 1, and ans is n + Σ (from k=2 to count_final) ((n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `count` is `m + 1`, `countmins` is `m`, `g` is `n / (m + 1) - m`, `ans` is the accumulated sum of `g / count + 1` for each iteration from `count = 2` to `count = m`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
