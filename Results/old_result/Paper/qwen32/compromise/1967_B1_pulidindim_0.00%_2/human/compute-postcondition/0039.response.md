The value of `g` is updated to `n / count`. The previous values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `count`, `ans`, and `countmins` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, and `g` is `n / count`.
