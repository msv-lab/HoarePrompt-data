The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 4, so the new value of `count` is 5. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is at least 4, `count` is 5, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `n / count - 3`, `ans` is `n + 3 * (g / count + 1)`**
