Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 4, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1`, `countmins` is 2, `g` is `n / 3`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
