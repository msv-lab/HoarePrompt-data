Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The third condition can be rewritten as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\).

### Simplifying the Condition:
Let's denote \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then \(a = d \cdot x\) and \(b = d \cdot y\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). The condition becomes:
\[ d \cdot x + d \cdot y = k \cdot d \cdot y \cdot x \]
\[ x + y = k \cdot x \cdot y \]
\[ k = \frac{x + y}{x \cdot y} \]

For \(k\) to be an integer, \(x + y\) must be divisible by \(x \cdot y\). This implies:
\[ x = 1 \text{ or } y = 1 \]
or
\[ x + y \geq x \cdot y \]

### Simplifying Further:
If \(y = 1\), then \(a + b = a + 1\) must be a multiple of \(b\). This means \(a + 1 = b \cdot k\), which is true for all \(a\) and \(b = 1\).

If \(x = 1\), then \(a = d\) and \(b = d \cdot y\). The condition becomes:
\[ 1 + y = k \cdot y \]
\[ k = \frac{1 + y}{y} \]
This is true if \(y\) divides \(1 + y\), which is always true for \(y = 1\).

### Counting Valid Pairs:
- For each \(b\), \(a\) can be any value from 1 to \(n\) if \(b = 1\).
- For each \(b > 1\), \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b\) and \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Program Analysis:
Let's examine the provided program and see if it correctly counts the number of valid pairs.

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n  # Counting pairs where b = 1
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))
```

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Initialization of `ans`:** The program initializes `ans` to `n`, which correctly counts pairs where \(b = 1\).
2. **Loop for `count`:** The loop starts from `count = 2` and iterates up to `m`. For each `count`, it calculates `g = n / count` and checks if `g < countmins`. If true, it breaks the loop.
3. **Calculation of `g` and `ans`:** The calculation `g -= countmins` and `ans += g / count + 1` does not correctly account for the number of valid pairs for each `b`.

### Correctness:
The program does not correctly count the number of valid pairs for \(b > 1\). It incorrectly assumes that `g` and the subsequent calculations will give the correct number of valid pairs, which is not the case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
