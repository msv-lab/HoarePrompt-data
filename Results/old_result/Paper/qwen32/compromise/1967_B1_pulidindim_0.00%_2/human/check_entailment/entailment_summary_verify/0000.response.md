Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its logic to determine if it correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement.

### Problem Recap
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Provided Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a loop and some calculations. Let's break down the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))
```

### Key Points of the Code:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `count` is initialized to 2.
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`.

2. **Loop**:
   - The loop runs while `count <= m`.
   - `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
   - `g` is calculated as `n / count`.
   - If `g < countmins`, the loop breaks.
   - `g` is then adjusted by subtracting `countmins`.
   - `ans` is updated by adding `g / count + 1`.
   - `count` is incremented by 1.

3. **Output**:
   - The final value of `ans` is printed as an integer.

### Evaluation Against the Problem Statement
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition. Here are the reasons:

1. **Iterative Logic**:
   - The program does not explicitly iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\).
   - Instead, it uses a loop based on `count` and performs calculations that do not directly relate to counting the pairs \((a, b)\).

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The program does not check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for each pair \((a, b)\).

3. **Counterexample**:
   - For the input `10 8`, the expected output is `14` as explained in the problem statement.
   - However, the provided program does not produce this output because it does not correctly implement the required logic.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final Evaluation**: **False**
