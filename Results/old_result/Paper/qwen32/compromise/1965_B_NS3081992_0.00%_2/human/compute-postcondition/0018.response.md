The code snippet appends the value `2 * k + 1` to the list `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 < k <= n`; `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the length of the binary string `b`; `bk` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix; `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk`; `ans` is a list containing `[2, k - 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`.**
