You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine whether it correctly solves the given problem.

### Analysis:

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **No Subsequence of Sum `k`**: There should not be any subsequence of the sequence `a` that sums to `k`.
2. **Subsequences for All `v` (1 ≤ v ≤ n, v ≠ k)**: For every integer `v` in the range [1, n] except `k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

#### Program Explanation:
The program consists of several utility functions for input reading and one main function `func_14` that generates the sequence `a` for each test case. The main function `func_14` is the core of the program.

##### Handling Special Cases:
- **If `k == 1`**:
  - If `n == 2`, the sequence is `[2]` because the only possible sum is 2, and we need no sum to be 1.
  - Otherwise, the sequence starts with `[2, 3]`, and then it appends powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`. This ensures that all sums from 1 to `n` (except 1) can be formed using these powers of 2.

- **If `k != 1`**:
  - The sequence starts with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k-1`.
  - It then adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure that the sum of the sequence does not include `k`.
  - It adds `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to the sequence to ensure that all sums up to `n` (except `k`) can be formed.
  - Finally, it appends powers of 2 from the length of the binary representation of `k` up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

#### Validation:
- **No Subsequence of Sum `k`**:
  - The program ensures that the sum `k` is not achievable by carefully constructing the sequence. For example, when `k != 1`, the term `k - 1 - sum(ans)` ensures that the sum `k` cannot be formed.
  
- **Subsequences for All `v` (1 ≤ v ≤ n, v ≠ k)**:
  - The use of powers of 2 allows the formation of any sum that can be represented in binary, except for `k`. For example, when `k == 1`, the sequence `[2, 3, 4, ...]` can form all sums except 1. When `k != 1`, the sequence includes powers of 2 up to the binary length of `k-1` and `k+1`, `2*k+1`, and further powers of 2 up to the binary length of `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly generate sequences that meet the problem's requirements. It handles the special case when `k == 1` and the general case when `k != 1` by carefully constructing the sequence to exclude the sum `k` while allowing all other sums up to `n`.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description.

**Correctness: True**
