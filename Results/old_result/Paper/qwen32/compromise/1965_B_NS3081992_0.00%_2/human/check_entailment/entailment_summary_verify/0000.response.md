Let's analyze the provided code and the problem requirements systematically using the function summaries and the initial assessment.

### Problem Requirements Recap
1. **Condition 1**: There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
2. **Condition 2**: For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

### Code Analysis
The function `func_14` is responsible for generating the sequence `a` for each test case. Let's break down the logic:

#### Case 1: `k == 1`
- If `n == 2`, the sequence is `[2]`.
- Otherwise, the sequence is initialized with `[2, 3]` and then appends powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

#### Case 2: `k > 1`
- The sequence is initialized with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`.
- It then appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1`.
- Finally, it appends powers of 2 from the length of the binary representation of `k` up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

### Evaluation Using Function Summary and Problem Requirements

#### Example Case 1: `n = 8`, `k = 8`
- The generated sequence is `[1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 17]`.
- **Condition 1**: We need to check if any subsequence sums to `8`. The sequence `[1, 2, 4]` sums to `7`, and other combinations do not sum to `8`. The sequence `[7, 1]` sums to `8`, which violates Condition 1.
- **Condition 2**: We need to check if all sums from `1` to `8` (except `8`) can be formed. The subsequences `[1]`, `[2]`, `[4]`, `[1, 2]`, `[1, 4]`, `[2, 4]`, and `[1, 2, 4]` form sums `1`, `2`, `4`, `3`, `5`, `6`, and `7` respectively. This condition is satisfied.

#### Example Case 2: `n = 10`, `k = 7`
- The generated sequence is `[1, 2, 8, 3]`.
- **Condition 1**: We need to check if any subsequence sums to `7`. The subsequences `[1, 2, 4]` do not exist, but `[1, 2, 3, 1]` is not valid. However, `[1, 2, 4]` sums to `7`, which violates Condition 1.
- **Condition 2**: We need to check if all sums from `1` to `10` (except `7`) can be formed. The subsequences `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]`, `[1, 2]`, `[1, 3]`, `[2, 3]`, and `[1, 2, 3]` form sums `1`, `2`, `3`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6` respectively. The sequence `[8]` forms `8`, and other combinations do not form sums `9` or `10`. This condition is not fully satisfied.

#### Example Case 3: `n = 6`, `k = 1`
- The generated sequence is `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
- **Condition 1**: We need to check if any subsequence sums to `1`. No subsequence sums to `1`, which satisfies Condition 1.
- **Condition 2**: We need to check if all sums from `1` to `6` (except `1`) can be formed. The subsequences `[2]`, `[3]`, `[4]`, `[5]`, `[6]`, `[2, 3]`, `[2, 4]`, `[2, 5]`, `[2, 6]`, `[3, 4]`, `[3, 5]`, `[3, 6]`, `[4, 5]`, `[4, 6]`, `[5, 6]`, `[2, 3, 4]`, `[2, 3, 5]`, `[2, 3, 6]`, `[2, 4, 5]`, `[2, 4, 6]`, `[2, 5, 6]`, `[3, 4, 5]`, `[3, 4, 6]`, `[3, 5, 6]`, `[4, 5, 6]`, `[2, 3, 4, 5]`, `[2, 3, 4, 6]`, `[2, 3, 5, 6]`, `[2, 4, 5, 6]`, and `[3, 4, 5, 6]` form sums `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `7`, `8`, `9`, `9`, `10`, `11`, `9`, `10`, `11`, `12`, `13`, `14`, `12`, `13`, `14`, `15`, `16`, `13`, `14`, `15`, `16`, `17`, `18`, `19`, `20`, and `21` respectively. The sequence does not form `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6` correctly. This condition is not fully satisfied.

#### Example Case 4: `n = 9`, `k = 3`
- The generated sequence is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
- **Condition 1**: We need to check if any subsequence sums to `3`. The subsequence `[1, 1, 1]` sums to `3`, which violates Condition 1.
- **Condition 2**: We need to check if all sums from `1` to `9` (except `3`) can be formed. The subsequences `[1]` form `1`, `[1, 1]` form `2`, `[1, 1, 1]` form `3`, `[1, 1, 1, 1]` form `4`, `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` form `5`, `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` form `6`, and `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` form `7`. This condition is not fully satisfied.

### Conclusion
The code does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem requirements. Specifically, the function `func_14` generates sequences that do not satisfy both conditions for all possible values of `n` and `k`.

Final: **False**
