Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly determine the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The code simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and sums them up. However, this approach does not account for overlapping substrings or the optimal way to remove characters to make the string beautiful.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
7
ppiepie
```
The correct answer should be 2, as removing the second 'p' and the second 'i' would make the string "pepie", which is beautiful. However, the provided code would output 2 because it counts the two occurrences of "pie" and sums them up, but it does not consider the optimal removal of characters.

Another example:
```
1
6
mapmap
```
The correct answer should be 4, as removing all characters would make the string empty, which is trivially beautiful. However, the provided code would output 2 because it counts the two occurrences of "map" and sums them up, but it does not consider the optimal removal of characters.

The code needs to implement a more sophisticated algorithm to find the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie" from the string. It should consider overlapping substrings and find the optimal way to remove characters.
