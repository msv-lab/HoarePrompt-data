Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Counting Substrings**: The program counts the number of occurrences of "map" and "pie" in the string `s` and then removes "map" from the string before counting "pie". This approach is flawed because it doesn't account for overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie" and does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions needed to make the string beautiful.

2. **Minimum Deletions**: The problem requires finding the minimum number of characters to remove to make the string beautiful. The current implementation simply counts the total occurrences of "map" and "pie" and outputs their sum, which is not necessarily the minimum number of deletions required.

3. **Dynamic Programming or Greedy Approach**: To solve this problem correctly, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm that considers all possible deletions to remove "map" and "pie" substrings with the minimum cost. The current implementation does not address this requirement.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
