The value of `a[l]` is decremented by `mi`. Therefore, the new value of `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `T` is `T - 1`, `t` is 0 or 1 if the loop terminates due to `mi * 2 > k`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `a[l]` decremented by `mi`, `l` is 0, `r` must be at least 1, `mi` is the minimum between `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**
