Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `T` is `T - 1`, `t` is 0 or 1 if the loop terminates due to `mi * 2 > k`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `a[l]` and `a[r]` decreased by `mi`, `l` is 0, `r` must be at least 1, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, `k` is `k - mi * 2`.**

In natural language: The value of `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`. All other conditions and values remain the same as in the initial state.
