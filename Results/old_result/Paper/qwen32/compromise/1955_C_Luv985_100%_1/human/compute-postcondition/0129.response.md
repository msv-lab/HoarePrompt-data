Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `T` is `T - 1`, `t` is either 0 or 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in `input().split()` to integers with `a[l]` reduced by `mi` and `a[r]` further reduced by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `l` is 0, `r` is at least 1, `ans` is 5 if both `a[l]` and `a[r]` were 0 after reduction, 4 if either `a[l]` or `a[r]` was 0 after reduction, and 3 otherwise if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `ans` is `ans + 1`, and `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
