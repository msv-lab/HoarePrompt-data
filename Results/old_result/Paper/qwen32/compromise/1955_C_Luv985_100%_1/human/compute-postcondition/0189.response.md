Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `T` is `T - 1`, `t` is 0 or 1 if the loop terminates due to `mi * 2 > k`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `a[l]` decremented by `mi` and `a[r]` decremented by `mi`, `l` is 0, `r` must be at least 1, `mi` is the minimum between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the decrement, `k` is `k - mi * 2`.**

In simple terms: The value of `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`. All other conditions and variable states remain the same as described in the initial state.
