Postcondition: **`T` is `T - 1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is the integer representation of the corresponding string from the input string split by whitespace, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is min(a[0], a[n-1]), and `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`.**
