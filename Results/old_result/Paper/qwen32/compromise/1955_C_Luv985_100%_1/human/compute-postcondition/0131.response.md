Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `T` is `T - 1`, `t` is either 0 or 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in `input().split()` to integers with `a[l]` reduced by `mi` and `a[r]` further reduced by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `l` is 0, `r` is at least 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `T`, `t`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `mi` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
