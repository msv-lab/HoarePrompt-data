Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `T` is `T - 1`, `t` is 0 or 1 if the loop terminates due to `mi * 2 > k`. `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `mi * 2 <= k`, `a[l]` and `a[r]` are decreased by `mi`; if `a[r]` becomes 0, `r` is `r - 1` and `ans` is incremented by 1; if `a[l]` becomes 0, `l` is set to 1 and `ans` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `l` remains 0. `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, and `k` is `k - mi * 2`. If `mi * 2 > k`, `t` is 0 if `k` is even and 1 if `k` is odd. If `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is incremented by 1 and the loop or statement is exited. `r` must be at least 1.**
