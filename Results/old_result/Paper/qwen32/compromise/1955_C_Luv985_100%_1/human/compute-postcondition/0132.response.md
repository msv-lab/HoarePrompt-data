Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `T` is `T - 1`, `t` will be either 0 or 1 if the loop terminates due to `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise it remains the same, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in `input().split()` to integers with `a[l]` reduced by `mi` and `a[r]` further reduced by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, `k` is `k - mi * 2`. If `a[l]` is 0, `l` is 1, otherwise `l` remains 0. If `a[r]` was 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 and `r` is `r - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. If `mi * 2 > k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block, taking into account the conditions and modifications specified in both the if and else parts.
