Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0 and `k` is now `k - mi * 2`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi` and `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - mi`, `ans` is 2, `mi` is `min(a[0] + mi, a[n-1] + mi)`, `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, the current value of `a[r]` is 0.**

Natural Language: The value of `r` has been decremented by 1, so it is now `n - 2`. All other variables retain their previous values.
