Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `i` is 3.
- `n` is at least 5 (this doesn't affect the print statement directly).
- `k` is 2 (this also doesn't affect the print statement directly).
- `v` remains unchanged (we don't know its value, but it will be used in the calculation).
- `cnt` must be non-zero (this doesn't affect the print statement directly).
- `l` is `func_2() + 1` where `func_2()` returns a value less than 5. This means `l` will be between 2 and 6 (since `func_2()` returns a value from 1 to 4).

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

- `?` is a literal character.
- `{l}` will be replaced by the value of `l`, which is `func_2() + 1` (a value between 2 and 6).
- `{i * v}` will be replaced by the product of `i` (which is 3) and `v` (an unknown value).

### Final Output Description:
Given the above analysis, the output will be in the form `? [l] [i * v]`, where `[l]` is a value between 2 and 6, and `[i * v]` is the product of 3 and `v`.

Since the exact value of `v` is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `i * v`. However, we know that `i * v` will be `3 * v`.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **? [l] [3 * v] (where l is a value between 2 and 6, and v is the value of v)**
