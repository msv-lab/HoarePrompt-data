The value of `cnt` is decremented by 1. Initially, `cnt` is `k - 2`. After decrementing, `cnt` becomes `(k - 2) - 1`, which simplifies to `k - 3`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `k` must be at least 3, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is `k - 3`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**.
