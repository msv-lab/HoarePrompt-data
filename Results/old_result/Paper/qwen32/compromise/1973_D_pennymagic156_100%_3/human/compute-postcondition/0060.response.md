To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and its impact on the variables.

Initial State: 
- `i` is 2
- `n` is at least 3
- `k` is 2
- `v` remains unchanged
- `cnt` is 0
- `l` is initially set to `func_2() + 1` and must be less than 4
- `l` also equals `n + 1`

Given Code:
```python
func_2()
```

Since `func_2()` is called but its implementation details are not provided, we can only infer that calling `func_2()` might have side effects or return a value. However, since the problem specifies that `l` is both `func_2() + 1` and `n + 1`, we can assume that `func_2()` returns `n`.

Let's consider the implications:
- If `func_2()` returns `n`, then `l` would be `n + 1` (as per the initial state).
- Since `l` must be less than 4, it implies `n + 1 < 4` or `n < 3`. However, the initial state specifies that `n` is at least 3, which creates a contradiction unless `n` is exactly 3 to satisfy both conditions (`n + 1 = 4` which is not less than 4, but `n + 1 = 4` is the boundary condition).

Given these constraints, let's assume `n` is exactly 3 to satisfy `l = n + 1 < 4` (since `l` must be less than 4 and `n` is at least 3).

Thus, `l` would be `3 + 1 = 4`, but since `l` must be less than 4, the only way to satisfy this is if `n` is exactly 3 and `l` is recalculated as `func_2() + 1` which should be less than 4. Given the constraints, let's assume `func_2()` returns a value such that `l` remains consistent with the conditions.

Therefore, the output state considering the constraints and assumptions is:

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 3, `k` is 2, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is 0, `l` is 4 (but must be less than 4, so `func_2()` must return a value such that `l` is recalculated to be less than 4)**

However, given the strict constraints and the problem's nature, the most consistent state would be:

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 3, `k` is 2, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is 0, `l` is recalculated to be less than 4 based on `func_2()`'s return value**

Since the exact return value of `func_2()` isn't specified, we can't determine `l` precisely, but we know it must be recalculated to be less than 4. For simplicity and consistency with the problem's constraints, let's assume `func_2()` returns a value such that `l` is recalculated to be 3 (the highest value less than 4).

Final Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 3, `k` is 2, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is 0, `l` is 3**

This satisfies all the given conditions and constraints.
