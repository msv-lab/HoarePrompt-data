Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\); `i` is `i`; `v` is `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, and `v` remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
