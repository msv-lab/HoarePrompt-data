To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop head: `cnt` and `l < n + 1`.

### Analysis:

1. **Condition `cnt`:**
   - The loop requires `cnt` to be truthy (non-zero) to execute.
   - In the given state, `cnt` is 0, which is falsy.

2. **Condition `l < n + 1`:**
   - We know that `l` is defined as `func_2() + 1` and `func_2()` returns a value less than 5.
   - Therefore, `l` is between 1 and 5 (inclusive).
   - Given that `n` is at least 5, `n + 1` is at least 6.
   - Since `l` is between 1 and 5, `l < n + 1` is always true when `n` is at least 5.

### Conclusion:
- To satisfy the `while` loop condition, `cnt` must be set to a non-zero value because `l < n + 1` is already satisfied.
- No changes are required to `l`, `n`, `i`, `k`, `v`, or any other variables outside the loop head.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is at least 5, `k` is 2, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` must be non-zero, `l` is `func_2() + 1` where `func_2()` returns a value less than 5**
