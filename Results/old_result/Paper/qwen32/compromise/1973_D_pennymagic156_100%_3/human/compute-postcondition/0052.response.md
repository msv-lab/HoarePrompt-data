The code snippet `cnt -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt` by 1. Given that the initial state specifies `cnt` is 1, after the decrement, `cnt` becomes 0.

Other variables remain unchanged:
- `i` is still 2.
- `n` must still be at least 3.
- `k` is still 2.
- `v` remains unchanged.
- `l` is still `func_2() + 1` and must still be less than 4.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 3, `k` is 2, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and must be less than 4.**
