To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

- `i` is explicitly set to 3.
- `n` is stated to be at least 5, but its exact value is not needed for this specific print statement.
- `k` is explicitly set to 2, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `v` remains unchanged, but its value is not specified, so we'll denote it as `v`.
- `cnt` is explicitly set to 1, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `l` must be less than 6, but its exact value is not specified, so we'll denote it as `l`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

Here's the breakdown of what will be printed:
- The first part of the string is a literal question mark (`?`).
- The second part is the value of `l`.
- The third part is the result of the expression `i * v`. Since `i` is 3, this will be `3 * v`.

Given the above, the output will be:
Output: **? [l] [3 * v] (where l is a value less than 6 and v is the value of v)**
