To determine the output state, we need to consider the given initial state and the effect of the line of code `l = func_2() + 1`. The function `func_2()` is not defined in the provided context, so we cannot determine its exact return value. However, we know that `l` will be updated to the value returned by `func_2()` plus 1.

Given:
- Initial State: `i` is 3, `n` is at least 5, `k` is 2, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is 2, `l` is 1

After executing `l = func_2() + 1`, the value of `l` changes, but the values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `v`, and `cnt` remain the same.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is at least 5, `k` is 2, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is 2, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**.
