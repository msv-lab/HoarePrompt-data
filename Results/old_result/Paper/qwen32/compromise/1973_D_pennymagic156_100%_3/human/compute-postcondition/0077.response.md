Let's analyze the given loop and its behavior step-by-step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` is at least 5
   - `k` is 2
   - `v` remains unchanged
   - `cnt` is 2
   - `l` is 1

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `cnt > 0` and `l < n + 1`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - Prints `? {l} {i * v}`
   - Updates `l` to `func_2() + 1`
   - Decrements `cnt` by 1

4. **Output States After Iterations:**
   - **After 1st iteration:**
     - `cnt` becomes 1
     - `l` becomes `func_2() + 1`
   - **After 2nd iteration:**
     - `cnt` becomes 0
     - `l` becomes `func_2() + 1` again, with `func_2()` returning a value less than 5
   - **After 3rd iteration:**
     - `cnt` is non-zero and decreases by 1 (but since it was 0 after the 2nd iteration, this doesn't apply here)
     - `l` is a value between 1 and 5 (inclusive)

From the above, we can deduce that:
- The loop runs exactly twice because `cnt` starts at 2 and is decremented by 1 each iteration.
- After the second iteration, `cnt` becomes 0, which stops the loop.
- The value of `l` after the second iteration is `func_2() + 1`, and since `cnt` is now 0, the loop terminates.

Therefore, the final output state of the loop is:
- `i` remains 3
- `n` remains at least 5
- `k` remains 2
- `v` remains unchanged
- `cnt` is 0
- `l` is `func_2() + 1` from the second iteration, which is a value between 2 and 6 (since `func_2()` returns a value less than 5, making `l` between 2 and 5).

Since the exact value of `func_2()` is not specified beyond it being less than 5, we can only say `l` is between 2 and 5. However, based on the provided information, the most specific we can say is that `l` is `func_2() + 1` after the second iteration.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is at least 5, `k` is 2, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, `cnt` will be 0, and `l` will be one more than the value returned by `func_2()` from the second iteration, which is a value between 2 and 5. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `v`) remain unchanged.
