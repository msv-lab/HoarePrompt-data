To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `i` is set to 1.
- `n` must be at least 2 (but its exact value is not specified).
- `k` must be at least 3 (but its exact value is not specified).
- `v` remains unchanged (its exact value is not specified).
- `cnt` is set to `k - 2` (but since `k` is not specified, `cnt`'s exact value is also not specified).
- `l` must be less than 3 (but its exact value is not specified).

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement uses an f-string to format the output.
- It includes the character `'?'` followed by the value of `l` and the result of the expression `i * v`.

Given the initial state:
- We know `i` is 1.
- `l` must be less than 3, so `l` could be 0, 1, or 2.
- `v` remains unchanged, but its exact value is not provided.

Thus, the output will depend on the specific values of `l` and `v`. Since these values are not explicitly provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output Description:
- The output starts with `'?'`.
- It is followed by the value of `l`, which can be 0, 1, or 2.
- It is then followed by the product of `i` (which is 1) and `v` (which is unknown).

Therefore, the output can be described as:
Output: **? [l] [v] (where l is a value less than 3 and v is the value of v)**
