Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be at least `k` (though the specific value of `n` is not used in the print statement).
- `k` must be non-zero (though the specific value of `k` is not used in the print statement).
- `v` remains unchanged (its specific value is not provided, so we'll denote it as `v`).
- `cnt` is `k` (though the specific value of `cnt` is not used in the print statement).
- `l` is 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- `l` is explicitly given as 1.
- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `v` is not explicitly given a value, so we'll keep it as `v`.

The expression `i * v` will be evaluated as `1 * v`, which simplifies to `v`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output a formatted string with the values of `l` and `i * v`.

Output: **? 1 v (where v is the value of v)**
