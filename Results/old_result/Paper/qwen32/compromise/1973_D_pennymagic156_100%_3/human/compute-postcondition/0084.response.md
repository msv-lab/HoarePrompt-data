The `print` statement in the given Python code snippet is:

```python
print('! -1', flush=True)
```

This statement directly prints the string `'! -1'` followed by a newline character. The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is immediately flushed from the buffer to the console, but it does not affect the content being printed.

Based on the initial state provided, the variables `i`, `v`, `n`, and `k` are mentioned but they do not influence the content of the `print` statement since the string `'! -1'` is explicitly specified.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **! -1**
