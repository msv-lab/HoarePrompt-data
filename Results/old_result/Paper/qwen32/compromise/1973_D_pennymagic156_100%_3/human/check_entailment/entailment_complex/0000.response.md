### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to understand if it meets the requirements.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Find the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into exactly `k` subarrays, where each subarray satisfies `f(l, r) = m`.
2. **Constraints**: 
   - `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4`
   - Each query to Fox is of the form `? l x`, and Fox responds with the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = x` or `n+1` if no such `r` exists.
   - At most `2n` queries are allowed.
3. **Output**: Print `! m` if such `m` exists, otherwise print `! -1`.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are utility functions to read input. `func_3` is used in `func_5` to read `n` and `k`.
   
2. **Finding Maximum Possible `m`**:
   - The code starts by trying to find the maximum possible value of `m` by querying `f(1, i*n)` for `i` from `n` down to `1`. This is done to find the largest `m` such that `f(1, r) = m` for some `r`.
   - If `v` (the response from Fox) is `n`, it means `f(1, i*n) = i*n` is possible, and `v` is set to `i`.
   
3. **Checking Feasibility of `m`**:
   - For each candidate `m` (from `v` down to `1`), the code checks if the array can be split into `k` subarrays, each with `f(l, r) = m`.
   - It does this by making queries of the form `? l m` and checking if it can find `k` such subarrays that cover the entire array.
   
4. **Output**:
   - If a valid `m` is found, it prints `! m` and terminates the test case.
   - If no valid `m` is found after checking all candidates, it prints `! -1`.

#### Correctness:
- The approach seems logically sound. It tries to find the largest possible `m` and checks if it can be achieved with `k` subarrays.
- The number of queries is within the allowed limit (`2n`).
- The code handles the interaction with Fox correctly by flushing the output after each query.

Given the above analysis, the code appears to correctly solve the problem as per the provided description and constraints.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
