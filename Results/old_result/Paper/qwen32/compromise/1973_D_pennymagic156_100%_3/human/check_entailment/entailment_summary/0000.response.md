### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the problem requirements step-by-step to determine if the solution is correct.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Find the largest value \( m \) such that the array \( a \) can be split into exactly \( k \) subarrays where each subarray satisfies \( f(l, r) = m \).
2. **Constraints**:
   - \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \)
   - Each subarray must satisfy \( f(l, r) = m \), where \( f(l, r) = (r - l + 1) \times \max(a[l], a[l+1], ..., a[r]) \).
   - At most \( 2n \) queries can be made.
3. **Queries**:
   - Query format: `? l x`
   - Response: Smallest \( r \) such that \( f(l, r) = x \) or \( n+1 \) if no such \( r \) exists.

#### Analysis of `func_5`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Reads \( n \) and \( k \) using `func_3`.
   - Initializes \( v = 1 \).

2. **Finding Maximum Possible \( m \)**:
   - Iterates from \( n \) down to 1.
   - Queries `? 1 {i * n}` to find the smallest \( r \) such that \( f(1, r) = i \times n \).
   - If \( r = n \), it sets \( v = i \) and breaks out of the loop.
   - This loop aims to find the largest possible \( m \) by checking if \( m = i \times n \) can be achieved starting from the beginning of the array.

3. **Checking Feasibility of \( m \)**:
   - Iterates from 1 to \( \frac{n}{k} + 1 \).
   - For each \( i \), tries to split the array into \( k \) subarrays where each subarray has \( f(l, r) = i \times v \).
   - Uses a nested loop to make queries and check if the array can be split as required.
   - If successful, prints `! {i * v}` and exits.
   - If no valid \( m \) is found, prints `! -1`.

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Maximum \( m \) Calculation**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n, 0, -1)` is intended to find the largest possible \( m \). However, it only checks multiples of \( n \) (i.e., \( i \times n \)). This is too restrictive and may miss the actual largest \( m \) if it is not a multiple of \( n \).

2. **Feasibility Check**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n // k + 1)` is also too restrictive. It only checks multiples of \( v \) (i.e., \( i \times v \)), which may not cover all possible values of \( m \).

3. **Query Limit**:
   - The code does not ensure that the number of queries does not exceed \( 2n \). Given the nested loops and the nature of the problem, it is likely that the query limit could be exceeded.

### Conclusion:
Given the above issues, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to find the largest \( m \) that satisfies the conditions of the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
