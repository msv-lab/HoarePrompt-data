### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Understanding the Problem:
The problem requires us to find the largest possible value `m` such that the array can be split into exactly `k` subarrays, where each subarray has the property that `(r - l + 1) * max(a[l], ..., a[r]) = m`.

#### Analyzing the Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_5()`.

2. **Function `func_5()`**:
   - Reads `n` and `k` using `func_3()`.
   - Initializes `v` to 1.
   - Iterates from `n` down to 1, making queries of the form `? 1 {i * n}`.
     - This query asks for the smallest `r` such that `f(1, r) = i * n`.
     - If `r == n`, it sets `v` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.
   - After the loop, `v` holds the maximum possible value such that `f(1, n)` could be `v * n`.

3. **Finding the Largest `m`**:
   - The program then iterates from `1` to `n // k + 1`.
   - For each `i`, it attempts to split the array into `k` subarrays, each with `f(l, r) = i * v`.
     - It makes queries of the form `? {l} {i * v}` to find the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = i * v`.
     - It increments `l` to `r + 1` and decrements `cnt` (which counts the number of remaining subarrays needed).
     - If it successfully splits the array into `k` subarrays (`cnt == 0` and `l == n + 1`), it prints `! {i * v}` and exits.
   - If no valid `m` is found, it prints `! -1`.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- **Query Strategy**:
  - The initial loop tries to find the maximum possible value `v` such that `f(1, n) = v * n`. This is a reasonable strategy to start with, as it helps in narrowing down the possible values of `m`.
  - The subsequent loop checks if the array can be split into `k` subarrays with `f(l, r) = i * v` for decreasing values of `i`. This ensures that the largest possible `m` is found first.
  
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where no valid `m` exists by printing `! -1`.
  - It also handles the case where `k = 1` by printing `! {f(1, n)}`.

- **Query Limit**:
  - The program makes at most `2 * n` queries per test case, which is within the allowed limit.

Based on the above analysis, the program appears to correctly solve the problem by systematically checking possible values of `m` and ensuring that the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the required properties.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
