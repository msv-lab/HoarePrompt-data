To determine the output of the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the involved variables:

1. **s1**: A string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
2. **pre**: A list of 1-based indices where the character '>' appears in `s1`.
3. **totalOne**: Initially set to 0.
4. **preOne**: A list initialized with a single element [0]. This list is intended to store cumulative sums of the number of '>' characters encountered up to each position in `s1`.
5. **suffZero**: A list containing cumulative sums of indices of '<' characters.
6. **ans**: A list of `n` values that will be updated with the calculated differences based on `preOne` and `suffZero`.

Given that the exact values of `s1`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, and `ans` are not provided, we can only describe the final state of `ans` in terms of the given information.

The `ans` list is populated with values that are calculated based on the cumulative sums of '>' and '<' characters. The exact values in `ans` depend on the specific string `s1` and the positions of '<' and '>' characters within it.

Since the exact values are not provided, we can describe the output as a list of `n` calculated differences.

Output: **ans (where ans is a list of n values calculated based on the cumulative sums of '>' and '<' characters in the string s1)**
