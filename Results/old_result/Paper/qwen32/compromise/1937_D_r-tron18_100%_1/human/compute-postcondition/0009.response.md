Functionality: **The function `func_2` takes a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and calculates a list of values based on the cumulative sums of indices of '>' and '<' characters in the string. The final output is a list `ans` of length `n` where each element represents a calculated difference based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters.**
