The provided Python code snippet initializes a new list `suffZero` with a single element `0`. This operation does not affect the values of `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, or `preOne`. The only change is the creation of `suffZero` with its initial value.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where the character '>' appears in `s1`, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, starting with the initial value of `0`, `suffZero` is `[0]`.**
