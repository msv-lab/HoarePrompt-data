The code snippet converts each character in `input_string` to an integer and stores these integers in a list named `arr`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string`.**
