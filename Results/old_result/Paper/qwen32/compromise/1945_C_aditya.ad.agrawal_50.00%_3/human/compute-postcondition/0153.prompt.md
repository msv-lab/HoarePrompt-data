Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of the first integer input, representing the number of test cases. The initial state for the number of houses `n` and the string `a` for each test case remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    n = int(input())
    input_string = input()
    arr = [int(ch) for ch in input_string]
    z = arr.count(0)
    o = arr.count(1)
    z_r = z
    o_r = o
    z_l = 0
    o_l = 0
    dist, ans, pos = abs(n / 2), 0, 0
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2:
        b_d = dist
    else:
        b_d = 30001
    for i in arr:
        pos += 1
        if i == 0:
            z_l += 1
            z_r -= 1
        else:
            o_l += 1
            o_r -= 1
        if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(
            n / 2 - pos):
            ans = pos
            b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)
    print(ans)
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is t - 1, n is the input integer, a remains unchanged, input_string is the string input by the user, arr is the list of integers derived from input_string, z is the count of 0s in arr, o is the count of 1s in arr, z_r is 0, o_r is 0, z_l is the total count of 0s in arr, o_l is the total count of 1s in arr, dist is abs(n / 2), ans is the position where conditions were met or 0, pos is len(arr), b_d is the minimum abs(n / 2 - pos) where conditions were met or 30001.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is the list of integers derived from `input_string`, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_l` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_l` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is the position where the conditions are last met (or 0 if never met), `pos` is the length of `arr`, and `b_d` is the smallest `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where the conditions are met (or 30001 if never met).
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is 0, n is an input integer, a remains unchanged, input_string is the new string input by the user, arr is the list of integers derived from input_string, z is the count of 0s in arr, o is the count of 1s in arr, z_l is the count of 0s in arr, o_l is the count of 1s in arr, z_r is 0, o_r is 0, dist is abs(n / 2), ans is the position where conditions were last met or 0, pos is n, b_d is the minimum abs(n / 2 - pos) where conditions were met or 30001.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
