Postcondition: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is the list of integers derived from `input_string` and must have at least 2 elements, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1. If `i` is 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `o_l` is incremented by 1 and `o_r` is decremented by 1. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is set to `pos` and `b_d` is updated to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`.**
