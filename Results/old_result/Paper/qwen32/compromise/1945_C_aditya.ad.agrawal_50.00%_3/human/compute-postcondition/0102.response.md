Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is the list of integers derived from `input_string`, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_l` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_l` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is the position where the conditions are last met (or 0 if never met), `pos` is the length of `arr`, and `b_d` is the smallest `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where the conditions are met (or 30001 if never met).**

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so `t` is now at least 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
