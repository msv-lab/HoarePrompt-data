To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, we need to understand the initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is set to 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` remains unchanged (its value is not specified in the precondition, so we cannot determine its value).
- `input_string` is a new string input by the user.
- `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string`.
- `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`.
- `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`.
- `z_l` is the count of 0s in `arr`.
- `o_l` is the count of 1s in `arr`.
- `z_r` is set to 0.
- `o_r` is set to 0.
- `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`.
- `ans` is the position where conditions were last met or 0.
- `pos` is set to `n`.
- `b_d` is the minimum `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where conditions were met or 30001.

### Key Variable for Output:
- The variable `ans` is described as "the position where conditions were last met or 0".

### Analysis:
- Since no specific conditions or operations are mentioned that modify `ans` after its initial assignment, we can assume that `ans` remains 0 unless explicitly changed by some logic in the code (which is not provided here).
- Given that no such logic is provided, `ans` retains its initial value of 0.

### Conclusion:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is 0 based on the provided initial state.

Output: **0**
