The code snippet provided decrements the value of `z_r` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Given the initial state, `z_r` is the count of 0s in the list `arr`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` and must have at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr` minus 1, `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_l` is 1, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 1, and `b_d` is set to `abs(n / 2)` if `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r + 1) / 2`, otherwise `b_d` is set to 30001. Additionally, `i` is 0.**
