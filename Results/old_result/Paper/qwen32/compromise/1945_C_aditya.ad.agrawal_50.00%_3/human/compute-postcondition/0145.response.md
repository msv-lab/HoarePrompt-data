The code snippet provided is:
```
o_r -= 1
```

This line of code decrements the value of `o_r` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` that must have at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is `pos + 1`, `o_l` is `o_l + 1`, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - pos)` if the condition is met, otherwise `b_d` retains its previous value, `ans` is set to `pos` if the condition is met, otherwise `ans` remains 0, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `o_r` is `o_r - 1`.**

In natural language: The value of `o_r` is decreased by 1. All other variables retain their previous values.
