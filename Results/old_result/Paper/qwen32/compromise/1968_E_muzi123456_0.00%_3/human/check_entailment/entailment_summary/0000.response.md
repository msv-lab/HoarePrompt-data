Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between pairs of chosen cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program, however, simply prints the points \((1,1), (1,2), \ldots, (1,n)\) for each test case. This arrangement will not maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances. For example, for \(n=3\), the program outputs \((1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\), which results in only one non-zero Manhattan distance (which is 1 or 2, but not both). The correct solution should strategically place points to maximize the variety of Manhattan distances.

Thus, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
