Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is defined as `t - 1`, but the initial value of `t` is not provided.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, but the exact value of `n` is not provided.
- `i` is set to 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward. It prints the string `'1'` followed by a space, and does not print any variable values. The `end=' '` parameter specifies that the string should end with a space instead of the default newline character.

Since the print statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, or `i`, their values do not affect the output.

### Output:
Output: **1 ** (where the output is the string '1' followed by a space)
