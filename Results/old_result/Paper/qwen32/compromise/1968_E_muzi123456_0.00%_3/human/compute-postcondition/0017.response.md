The code snippet `n = int(input())` will reassign the variable `n` to the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Given that `t` is `t - 1` (must be greater than 0) and `i` is `n + 1`, after the execution of the code, `t` will still be `t - 1` (must be greater than 0), and `i` will be `n + 1` based on the new value of `n`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` (must be greater than 0), `n` is an input integer, `i` is `n + 1`**
