Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State
- `t` is `t - 1` (must be greater than 0): This means that `t` has been decremented by 1 and is guaranteed to be greater than 0. However, the exact value of `t` is not provided.
- `n` must be at least 3: This indicates that `n` is an integer with a minimum value of 3.
- `i` is 3: The variable `i` is explicitly set to the integer value 3.

### Print Statement
The print statement is:
```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

### Analysis
- The `print` function in Python outputs the specified message to the console.
- The first argument `'1'` is a string literal, meaning it will always print the character '1'.
- The `end` parameter is set to a space `' '`, which means that after printing `'1'`, the cursor will move to the next space rather than moving to the next line (which is the default behavior).

### Output
Based on the print statement, the output will be the string `'1'` followed by a space.

Output: **1 **
