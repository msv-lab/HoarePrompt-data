The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement with the string `'1'` and uses the `end=' '` parameter to specify that a space should be printed after the string instead of the default newline character.

Let's break down the components:
- `'1'`: This is a string literal that will be printed.
- `end=' '`: This parameter in the `print` function specifies that a space should be printed after the string `'1'` instead of the usual newline character.

Given the initial state, the variables `t` and `n` are defined with certain constraints, but they are not used in the provided `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Based on this information, the output of the `print` statement will be the string `'1'` followed by a space.

Output: **1 **
