The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is:

```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

This statement will print the string `'1'` followed by a space, instead of the default newline character, because of the `end=' '` parameter.

Let's break down the code and the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 49.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000.
- `i` is 4.

However, none of these variables (`t`, `n`, `i`) are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement only prints the string `'1'` followed by a space.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **1 ** (where the output is the string '1' followed by a space)
