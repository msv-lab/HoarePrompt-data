Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

Initial State:
- `t` is `t - 1` (must be greater than 0)
- `n` must be at least 3
- `i` is 3

The print statement:
```python
print(i)
```

From the initial state, we know the value of `i` explicitly. The value of `i` is given as 3. There are no conditions or formulas affecting the value of `i` in the given information.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `i`, which is 3.

Output: **3**
