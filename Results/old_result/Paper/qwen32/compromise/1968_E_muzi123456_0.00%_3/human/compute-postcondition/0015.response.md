To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head. The loop is defined as:

```
while t:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will continue as long as `t` is truthy. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered truthy, and zero is considered falsy. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be a non-zero integer.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 49
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000
- `i` is n + 1

The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `t`. Since `t` must be non-zero for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

No other states (`n` and `i`) need to be adjusted because they do not affect the condition of the `while` loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000, `i` is n + 1**
