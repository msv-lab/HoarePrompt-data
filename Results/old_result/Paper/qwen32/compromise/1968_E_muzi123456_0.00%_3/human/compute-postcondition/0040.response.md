Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is defined as `t - 1`. However, the initial value of `t` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `t` after this operation.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, but its exact value is not provided.
- `i` is explicitly set to 3.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(i)` statement will output the value of the variable `i`. According to the initial state, `i` is explicitly set to 3.

### Conclusion:
The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 3.

### Output:
Output: **3**
