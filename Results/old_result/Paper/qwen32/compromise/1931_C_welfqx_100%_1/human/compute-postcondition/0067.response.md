The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split string into an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `num`. This operation does not change the values of `ck`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `cn`, `r`, or `f`. It only introduces a new list `num` containing the integers from the input.

Output State: **`ck` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, up to `n-1` if all elements are equal. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is increased by `ck`. Otherwise, `cn` remains unchanged. `r` is incremented by 1; `n` is an input integer; `f` is 1; `num` is a list of integers from the input.**
