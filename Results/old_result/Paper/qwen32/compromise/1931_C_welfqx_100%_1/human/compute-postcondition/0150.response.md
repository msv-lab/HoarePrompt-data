Output State: **`f` is 1 if all consecutive elements in `num` are equal, otherwise `f` is 0; `onum` is a copy of `num`; `cn` is `2 * n` if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, otherwise `cn` is `n`; `symb1` is the first character of `num`; `symb2` is the first character of `num`; `ii` is `n - 1`; `ck` is `n`; `r` is 1; `n` is the length of the input list. Additionally, either `n` is 1 or `f` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `onum` is updated to be a copy of `num`, while all other variables retain their initial values. Since `onum` is now a copy of `num`, `symb2`, which was the first character of `onum`, is now the same as `symb1`, which is the first character of `num`.
