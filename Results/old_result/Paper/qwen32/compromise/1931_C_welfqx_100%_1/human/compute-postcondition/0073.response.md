The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is at least 2. Since the loop did not break in the previous iteration, the element at index `j` of `num` must be equal to the element at index `j + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 1 and `n` should remain at least 2.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is 1**
