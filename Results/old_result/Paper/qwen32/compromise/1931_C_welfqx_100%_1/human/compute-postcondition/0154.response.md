The value of `f` is explicitly set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` is 1 or `f` is 1 still holds true, as `f` is now 1.

Output State: **`f` is 1; `onum` is the reverse of `num`; `cn` is 1; `symb1` is the first character of `num`; `symb2` is the first character of `num`; `ii` is `n - 1`; `ck` is 1; `r` is 1; `n` is the length of the input list.**
