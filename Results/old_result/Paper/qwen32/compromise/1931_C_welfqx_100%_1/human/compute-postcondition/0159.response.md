The code snippet `cn += 1` increments the value of `cn` by 1. Given that the initial value of `cn` is 1, after executing this line, `cn` will be 2. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`f` is 1; `onum` is the reverse of `num`; `cn` is 2; `symb1` is the first character of `num`; `symb2` is the last character of `num`; `ii` is `n - 1`; `ck` is 1; `r` is 1; `n` must be at least 2; the current element `num[i]` is equal to the next element `num[i + 1]`.**
