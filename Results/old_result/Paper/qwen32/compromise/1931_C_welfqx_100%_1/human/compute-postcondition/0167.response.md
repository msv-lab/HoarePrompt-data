The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, but since `i` is already `n - 1`, the loop will not execute again because `i` will not be less than `n - 1`.

However, if we consider the state right before the last iteration, `i` would have been `n - 2`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration (which would be the last iteration in this case), we need to set `i` to `n - 2`.

State: **`f` is 1; `onum` is the reverse of `num`; `symb1` is the first character of `num`; `symb2` is the last character of `num`; `ii` is `n - 1`; `ck` is 1; `r` is 1; `n` is at least 2; `i` is `n - 2`**
