Output State: **`f` is 1, `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`, `n` is at least 5, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, `i` is 4, `ck` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.
