The code snippet provided is:
```
n = int(input())
```
This line of code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. It does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`ck` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, up to `n-1` if all elements are equal. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is increased by `ck`. Otherwise, `cn` remains unchanged. `r` is incremented by 1; `n` is an input integer.**
