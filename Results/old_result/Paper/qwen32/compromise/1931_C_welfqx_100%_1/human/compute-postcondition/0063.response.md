To determine what will be printed by the `print(n - max(cn, ck))` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **ck**: This variable represents the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of some list (not explicitly mentioned, but implied). It counts how many elements from the start are equal to each other until a different element is encountered or the end of the list is reached.

2. **cn**: This variable is incremented by `ck` if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`. Otherwise, it remains unchanged. `symb1` and `symb2` are not explicitly defined in the problem statement, but based on the context, they likely represent symbols or values being compared in the list.

3. **n**: This is presumably the length of the list being considered.

The `print` statement calculates `n - max(cn, ck)`. To understand this, we need to consider the possible values of `ck` and `cn`:

- **ck**: This value depends on the number of consecutive equal elements from the start of the list.
- **cn**: This value is influenced by whether `symb1` equals `symb2`. If they are equal, `cn` is increased by `ck`; otherwise, it remains the same.

Given the information, let's analyze the output:

- If `symb1` is never equal to `symb2`, `cn` remains unchanged (presumably starting from 0 if not mentioned otherwise).
- If `symb1` is equal to `symb2` at any point, `cn` is increased by `ck`.
- The expression `max(cn, ck)` will give the larger of these two values.
- Subtracting this maximum from `n` will yield the result.

Without specific values for `n`, `ck`, `cn`, `symb1`, and `symb2`, we can't compute a numerical result. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables:

Output: **n - max(cn, ck) (where cn is increased by ck if symb1 equals symb2, otherwise cn remains unchanged, and ck is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of the list)**
