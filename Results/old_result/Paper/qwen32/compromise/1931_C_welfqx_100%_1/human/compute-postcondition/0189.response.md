Postcondition: **`f` is 1; `onum` is the reverse of `num`; `symb1` is the first character of `num` and is equal to `symb2`; `symb2` is the last character of `num`; `ii` is `n - 2`; `r` is 1; `n` is the length of the input list; if `symb1` equals `symb2`, then `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num` plus `ck`; otherwise, `cn` remains the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`. `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `onum`.**
