Output State: **`f` is 0, `onum` is the reversed copy of the new `num`, `cn` is `2 * n` if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, otherwise `cn` is the new `n`, `symb1` is the first character of the new `num`, `symb2` is the first character of `onum`, `ii` is the new `n - 1`, `ck` is the new `n`, `r` is 1, `num` is a list of integers from the input, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `n - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of all the variables remain the same, but the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
