The code snippet provided increments the variable `cn` by 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state of `cn` is `2`, and all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`f` is 1, `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`, `n` must be at least 2, `cn` is 2, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, and `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`.**
