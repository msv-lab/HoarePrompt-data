To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the variables involved in the print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`f` is 1**: This variable is defined but not used in the print statement.
2. **`onum` is the reverse of `num`**: `onum` is a reversed version of the list `num`.
3. **`symb1` is the first character of `num` and is equal to `symb2`**: `symb1` and `symb2` are both the first and last characters of `num`, respectively, and they are equal.
4. **`symb2` is the last character of `num`**: This is the same as `symb1`.
5. **`ii` is `n - 2`**: `ii` is defined as the second last index of the list `num` (where `n` is the length of `num`).
6. **`r` is 1**: This variable is defined but not used in the print statement.
7. **`n` is the length of the input list `num`**: `n` is the number of elements in `num`.
8. **If `symb1` equals `symb2`, then `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num` plus `ck`; otherwise, `cn` remains the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`**: Since `symb1` equals `symb2`, `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num` plus `ck`.
9. **`ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `onum`**: `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of the reversed list `onum`.

### Analysis:
- **`cn` Calculation**: 
  - Since `symb1` equals `symb2`, `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num` plus `ck`.
  - For example, if `num` is `[1, 1, 2, 3, 1]`, then `cn` is the count of consecutive `1`s starting from the first element (`2`) plus `ck`.
- **`ck` Calculation**:
  - `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `onum` (which is the reversed `num`).
  - For example, if `num` is `[1, 1, 2, 3, 1]`, then `onum` is `[1, 3, 2, 1, 1]` and `ck` is the count of consecutive `1`s starting from the first element (`2`).

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `num` is `[1, 1, 2, 3, 1]` for a concrete example:
- `onum` is `[1, 3, 2, 1, 1]`.
- `symb1` and `symb2` are both `1`.
- `n` is `5`.
- `cn` is the count of consecutive `1`s starting from the first element of `num` (`2`) plus `ck`.
- `ck` is the count of consecutive `1`s starting from the first element of `onum` (`2`).
- Therefore, `cn` is `2 + 2 = 4`.
- The print statement is `print(n - max(cn, ck))` which translates to `print(5 - max(4, 2))` which is `print(5 - 4)` which is `1`.

### General Output:
Given the general conditions and the example, the print statement will output `n - max(cn, ck)`. Here `cn` and `ck` are both counts of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num` and `onum` respectively, and since `symb1` equals `symb2`, `cn` includes `ck`.

Output: **n - max(cn, ck) (where `n` is the length of the list `num`, `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num` plus `ck`, and `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of the reversed list `onum`)**
