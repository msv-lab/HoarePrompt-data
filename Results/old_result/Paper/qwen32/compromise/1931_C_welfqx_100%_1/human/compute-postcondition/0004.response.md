The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns this list to the variable `num`. The other variables `t`, `r`, `n`, `a`, and `f` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the value of `num` will be a list of integers derived from the input. The precondition that `n` is an input integer and `a` is a list of `n` integers is not directly affected by this code snippet, but it is important to note that `num` now holds the list of integers that were input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
