The value of `ck` is incremented by 1. The values of `n` and `ii` remain unchanged as per the provided initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `ii` is `ii + 1`, and `ck` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `ck` is incremented by 1**.
