The code snippet provided is `cn += 1`, which increments the value of the variable `cn` by 1. However, the initial state does not specify an initial value for `cn`. Therefore, we can only state that `cn` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Output State: **`f` is 1, `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`, `n` is at least 5, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, `i` is 5, `ck` is 1, `cn` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
