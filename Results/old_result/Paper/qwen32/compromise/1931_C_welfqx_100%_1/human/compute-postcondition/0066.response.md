The code snippet `f = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `f`. None of the other variables (`ck`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `cn`, `r`, `n`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`ck` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, up to `n-1` if all elements are equal. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is increased by `ck`. Otherwise, `cn` remains unchanged. `r` is incremented by 1; `n` is an input integer; `f` is 1.**
