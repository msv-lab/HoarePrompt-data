Output State: **`f` is 1, `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is `n`, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `ii` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, none of the variables have changed their values, and we have exited the most internal loop or if statement.
