You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

    #State: A series of integers, each representing the output for a specific test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates and prints a single integer for each test case, which represents the minimum number of elements to remove from the list `a` to make all remaining elements the same.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases for making all elements of the array equal with the minimum number of burles. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Handling of Single Element Arrays:**
   - The code correctly identifies that if the array has only one element, no burles are needed, which is correct.
   
2. **Handling of Uniform Arrays:**
   - The code correctly identifies that if all elements in the array are the same, no burles are needed, which is correct.
   
3. **Handling of Non-Uniform Arrays:**
   - The code attempts to find the longest sequence of the same elements from the start and end of the array.
   - It then calculates the minimum burles needed by subtracting the length of the longest sequence from the total length of the array.
   - However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum burles required in all cases. It only considers sequences from the start and end, but there might be better ways to make the array uniform with fewer burles by selecting different segments.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
6
1 3 3 1 2 1
```
- The code will look at the longest sequence from the start and end.
- From the start, the longest sequence is `1` (length 1).
- From the end, the longest sequence is `1` (length 1).
- The code will then calculate the burles needed as `6 - max(1, 1) = 5`.
- However, a better way to make the array uniform is to select the segment `[3, 3, 1, 2]` and set it to `1`, which would cost `4` burles.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not handle all cases optimally. It only considers sequences from the start and end, which might not always result in the minimum number of burles required. Therefore, the code is incorrect for some test cases.
