### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of burles (which is equivalent to the number of elements that need to be changed) to make all elements of the array equal by performing at most one operation of assigning a value to a subarray. The provided program's logic is as follows:

1. **Initial Checks**: 
   - If the array has only one element or if all elements in the array are already the same, the cost is zero (no operation needed).
   - If not, it proceeds to analyze the array.

2. **Counting Consecutive Elements**:
   - It counts the number of consecutive elements from the start of the array that are the same (`cn`).
   - It also counts the number of consecutive elements from the end of the array that are the same (`ck`).

3. **Special Case Handling**:
   - If the first element of the array is the same as the first element of the reversed array, it means the array could potentially have a middle segment that is different, but the same element repeats at the start and end. In this case, the count `cn` is increased by `ck`.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - The minimum number of elements to change is calculated as `n - max(cn, ck)`. This means the program is trying to find the longest segment of the array that can remain unchanged (either from the start or the end or both if they are the same), and the rest need to be changed.

### Analysis:
- The logic seems to be correct for the given problem description. It efficiently calculates the minimum number of changes required by leveraging the longest unchanged segment from either end or both ends if they match.
- The program handles edge cases such as single-element arrays and arrays where all elements are already the same.
- The program also handles the case where the same element repeats at the start and end of the array, potentially allowing for a longer unchanged segment.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
