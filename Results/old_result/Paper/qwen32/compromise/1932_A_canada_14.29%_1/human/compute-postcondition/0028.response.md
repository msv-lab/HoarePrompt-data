The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the list `s`. Therefore, we need to adjust only the state of `i` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `len` is an input integer
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters
- `ret` is determined based on the current character `i`
- `thorn` is determined based on the current character `i`
- `i` is the next character in the list `s`

Since `i` is the current character being processed in the loop, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the next character in the list `s`. If `i` is currently the `k`-th character in the list, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the `(k+1)`-th character in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters; `ret` is 2 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 1 if the current character `i` is neither '@' nor '*', and `ret` is 1 if the current character `i` is '*' but `thorn` is not 2; `thorn` is 0 if the current character `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `thorn` is incremented by 1 if the current character `i` is '*', and if `thorn` equals 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of; `i` is the next character in the list `s`**.

Since `i` is the next character in the list and we are moving to the next iteration, `i` should be the next character in the list `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters; `i` is the next character in the list `s`**.

To be more specific, if `i` was the `k`-th character, now `i` should be the `(k+1)`-th character. However, since the exact position of `i` in the list `s` is not specified, we can only express the state in terms of `i` being the next character in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters; `i` is the next character in the list `s`**.

Since `ret` and `thorn` are determined based on the value of `i` and will be recalculated in the next iteration, they do not need to be adjusted here.

Final State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters; `i` is the next character in the list `s`**.
