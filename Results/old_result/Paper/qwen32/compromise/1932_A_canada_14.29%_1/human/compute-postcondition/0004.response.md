The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `thorn` to 0. The values of `t`, `len`, `s`, and `ret` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initialization of `thorn` while retaining the initial values of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `ret` is 0; `thorn` is 0.**
