Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is the input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `ret` is 0; `thorn` is 2; the current character `i` equals '*'**

In this postcondition, all the initial conditions from the precondition are retained, and the additional condition `thorn == 2` is included to reflect the state of the program after entering the if statement.
