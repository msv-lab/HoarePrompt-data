Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is the integer input by the user; `s` is a non-empty list of characters; `ret` is 1 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0; `thorn` is 3 if the current character `i` is '*' and `thorn` was 2 before, otherwise `thorn` is 1 if `i` is '*'; `i` is the next character in the list `s`**

Explanation: The value of `thorn` is incremented by 1. If `thorn` was 2 before and the current character `i` is '*', then `thorn` becomes 3. If `i` is '*' but `thorn` was not 2, `thorn` becomes 1. If `i` is not '*', `thorn` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
