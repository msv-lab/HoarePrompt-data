Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `ret` is 0; `thorn` is 1; the current character `i` is equal to '*'**

Natural language: The value of `thorn` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
