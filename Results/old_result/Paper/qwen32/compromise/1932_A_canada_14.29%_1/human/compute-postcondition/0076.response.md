Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the next character in the list `s`. If `i` is '@', `ret` is incremented by 1 and `thorn` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `i` is '*', `thorn` is incremented by 1, and if `thorn` was 2 before the increment, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `thorn` is set to 0.**
