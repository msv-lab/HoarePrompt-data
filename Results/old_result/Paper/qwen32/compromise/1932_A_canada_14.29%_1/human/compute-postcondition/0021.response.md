Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters; `ret` is 2 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 1; `thorn` is 0; `i` is the next character in the list `s`.**

In simple terms, the value of `ret` has been incremented by 1. If `ret` was 1 (meaning the current character `i` was not '@'), it is now 2. If `ret` was 0 (which would not be possible based on the initial state description, but for completeness), it would be 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
