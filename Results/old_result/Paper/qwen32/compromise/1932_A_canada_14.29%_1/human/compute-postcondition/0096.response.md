Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is the integer input by the user; `s` is a non-empty list of characters; `ret` is 0; if `i` is equal to '*', then `thorn` is either 2 (if it was 2 before) or unchanged (otherwise). If `i` is not equal to '*' and not equal to '@', then `thorn` remains 0.**
