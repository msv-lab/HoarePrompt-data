Given the code snippet `thorn += 1`, this line increments the value of `thorn` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this line of code. Here's the updated state:

- The value of `thorn` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `t`, `len`, `s`, `ret`, and `i` remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the integer input by the user, `s` is a non-empty list of characters, `ret` is either 1 or 2 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0, `thorn` is `thorn + 1` if the current character `i` is '*', and `thorn` remains 0 if `i` is not '@' and not '*', `i` is the next character in the list `s` after the current `i`.**
