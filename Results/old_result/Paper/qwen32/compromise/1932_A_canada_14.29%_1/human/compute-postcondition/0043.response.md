The code snippet provided resets the variable `ret` to 0. The other variables (`t`, `len`, `s`, `thorn`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is the input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `ret` is 0; `thorn` is 0 if the loop completes without `thorn` reaching 2, or 2 if the loop breaks due to encountering two consecutive '*' characters.**
