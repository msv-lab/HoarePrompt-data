To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to check the condition `i < n`. Given the state right before the loop, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5. Since `i` is 0, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Given the constraint 1 <= n <= 10^5, `n` will always be greater than 0, so no adjustment is needed for `n`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `counter` is 0, `i` is 0**
