To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the logic used in the program correctly solves the problem as described.

The key observation in the problem is that the winner of the game depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins ('U'). Here's why:

- If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where he faces an even number of facing-up coins after his turn.
- Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always force Alice into a position where she faces an odd number of facing-up coins after her turn.
- Since the game ends when there are no facing-up coins left, and Alice goes first, Alice will win if the initial number of facing-up coins is odd, and Bob will win if it is even.

The provided program correctly counts the number of facing-up coins ('U') in the string `s` and checks if this count is odd or even. If the count is odd, it prints "YES" (indicating Alice wins), and if the count is even, it prints "NO" (indicating Bob wins).

Here is the relevant part of the program:
```python
count_u = s.count('U')
if count_u % 2 == 1:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```
This logic is correct according to the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
