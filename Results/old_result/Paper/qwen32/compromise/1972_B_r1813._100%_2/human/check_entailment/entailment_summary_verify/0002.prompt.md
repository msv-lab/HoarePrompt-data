You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        s = data[index + 1]
        index += 2
        count_u = s.count('U')
        if count_u % 2 == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing 'U' and 'D'. For each test case, it checks if the number of 'U's in the string is odd. If it is, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the game rules and the provided solution.

### Game Analysis

1. **Game Rules Recap:**
   - Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins.
   - If there are only two coins left and one is removed, the other is not flipped.
   - If there is only one coin left, no flipping occurs.
   - If there are no facing-up coins, the player whose turn it is loses.
   - The game ends in a finite number of operations, and one player will win.

2. **Winning Strategy:**
   - The key observation is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins.
   - If the number of 'U's (facing-up coins) is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where he faces an even number of 'U's, and vice versa.
   - This is because each move reduces the number of 'U's by exactly one. If Alice starts with an odd number of 'U's, she can always ensure that Bob faces an even number after her turn, and eventually, Bob will face a situation with no 'U's left and lose.
   - Conversely, if Bob starts with an even number of 'U's, he can force Alice into a position where she faces an even number of 'U's, and Alice will eventually lose.

### Program Analysis

1. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins and the string representing the coins.
   - It counts the number of 'U's in the string.
   - If the count of 'U's is odd, it prints "YES" (indicating Alice wins).
   - If the count of 'U's is even, it prints "NO" (indicating Bob wins).

2. **Implementation Details:**
   - The program correctly reads and processes multiple test cases.
   - It accurately counts the number of 'U's in each test case.
   - It correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the count of 'U's.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. Thus, the program is correct.

**Reasoning:** The program correctly determines the winner based on whether the number of facing-up coins is odd or even, which is the optimal strategy for the game.

**Correctness:** **True**
