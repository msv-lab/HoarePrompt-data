Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, where each element is a separate word from the input, including integers and strings representing the test cases; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of `data[0]`; `index` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state means that `data` remains a list of strings with each element being a separate word from the input, including any integers and strings representing the test cases. The variable `t` still holds the integer value of the first element in `data` (`data[0]`). The new variable `index` is set to 1.
