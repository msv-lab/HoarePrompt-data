In the given task, the for loop iterates over the range of an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The variables `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4` are defined within the loop body for each test case and do not affect the loop's execution condition.

The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the integer `t` from the input. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in Python to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body.

Given this, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The variables `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4` do not need to be adjusted because they are defined inside the loop and do not affect the loop's execution condition.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
