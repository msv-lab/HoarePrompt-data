### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and evaluate its correctness based on the problem description and the function summary.

#### Code Breakdown:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function `func_1()` reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` of length 5 in the format "hh:mm".

2. **Extracting Hour and Minute:**
   - The hour part `h` is extracted from the string `s` using `s[:2]`.
   - The minute part is not explicitly extracted but used directly from the string `s` with `s[2:]`.

3. **Converting Hour to 12-hour Format:**
   - If the hour `h` is `'00'`, it is converted to `'12'` and printed.
   - If the hour `h` is less than or equal to `'12'`, it is printed as is.
   - If the hour `h` is greater than `'12'`, it is converted to the 12-hour format by subtracting 12 from the integer value of `h`. The result is then formatted to ensure it has a leading zero if needed, using `'0{}'.format(int(h) - 12)`.

4. **Determining AM/PM:**
   - The AM/PM part is determined by checking if the hour `h` is greater than or equal to `'12'`. If true, `'PM'` is printed; otherwise, `'AM'` is printed.

5. **Output Formatting:**
   - The converted hour, the minute part `s[2:]`, and the AM/PM part are printed together with a space in between.

#### Issues in the Code:

1. **Leading Zero Handling:**
   - The code does not correctly handle leading zeros for hours between 1 and 9 in the 12-hour format. For example, `13:00` should be converted to `01:00 PM`, but the code will output `1:00 PM`.
   - The line `print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')` is intended to add a leading zero, but it only does so if the resulting hour is a single digit (1-9). For hours 10-11, it will not add a leading zero.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles `'00'` correctly by converting it to `'12 AM'`.
   - The code handles `'12'` correctly by keeping it as `'12 PM'`.
   - However, the conversion for hours 13-23 does not correctly add leading zeros for hours 10-11.

#### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, the program does not handle all cases correctly, particularly those involving hours 10-11 in the 12-hour format. The original assessment correctly identifies these issues and concludes that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
