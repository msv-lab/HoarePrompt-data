Let's analyze the code step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Code Breakdown:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function `func_1()` is called without arguments.
   - The first line of input is read and converted to an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, a string `s` of length 5 (format `hh:mm`) is read.

2. **Extracting Hour and Minute:**
   - The hour part `h` is extracted from the string `s` using `s[:2]`.
   - The minute part is not explicitly extracted but is used directly from the string `s` with `s[2:]`.

3. **Converting Hour to 12-hour Format:**
   - If the hour `h` is `'00'`, it is converted to `'12'` and printed.
   - If the hour `h` is less than or equal to `'12'`, it is printed as is.
   - If the hour `h` is greater than `'12'`, it is converted to the 12-hour format by subtracting 12 from the integer value of `h`. The result is then formatted to ensure it has a leading zero if needed, using `'0{}'.format(int(h) - 12)`.
   
4. **Determining AM/PM:**
   - The AM/PM part is determined by checking if the hour `h` is greater than or equal to `'12'`. If true, `'PM'` is printed; otherwise, `'AM'` is printed.

5. **Output Formatting:**
   - The converted hour, the minute part `s[2:]`, and the AM/PM part are printed together with a space in between.

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Leading Zero Handling:**
   - The code does not correctly handle leading zeros for hours between 1 and 9 in the 12-hour format. For example, `13:00` should be converted to `01:00 PM`, but the code will output `1:00 PM`.
   - The line `print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')` is intended to add a leading zero, but it only does so if the resulting hour is a single digit (1-9). For hours 10-11, it will not add a leading zero.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles `'00'` correctly by converting it to `'12 AM'`.
   - The code handles `'12'` correctly by keeping it as `'12 PM'`.
   - However, the conversion for hours 13-23 does not correctly add leading zeros for hours 10-11.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, the program does not handle all cases correctly, particularly those involving hours 10-11 in the 12-hour format.

**Correctness: False**

### Suggested Fixes:

To fix the code, you can modify the hour conversion logic to ensure that hours 1-9 and 10-11 are formatted correctly with leading zeros:

```python
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h, m = s.split(':')
        h = int(h)
        if h == 0:
            h12 = 12
            period = 'AM'
        elif h < 12:
            h12 = h
            period = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            h12 = 12
            period = 'PM'
        else:
            h12 = h - 12
            period = 'PM'
        print(f"{h12:02}:{m} {period}")
```

This modification ensures that all hours are correctly formatted with leading zeros where necessary.
