The function `func_13` calculates and returns a tuple containing the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity for the given non-negative integers `a` and `b`, along with their greatest common divisor (GCD). Specifically, it returns a tuple `(x, y, g)` such that `ax + by = g`, where `g` is the GCD of `a` and `b`.
