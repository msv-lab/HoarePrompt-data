    #The program returns an integer read from the standard input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer from the standard input and returns this integer.

    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
    #The program returns a list with 'rows' number of elements, where each element is the result of calling the function 'func_7()'

#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, processing is a list of integers representing some processing state, da is an integer key present in the dictionary d, and rank is a list of integers used to store ranks or results corresponding to the keys in d.

    #The program returns the minimum value returned by `func_12` during any of the iterations, plus 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` processes a dictionary `d` with integer keys and lists of integers as values, a list `processing` that tracks processing states, an integer `da` which is a key in `d`, and a list `rank` used to store results. It returns 1 if the list associated with `da` in `d` contains only one element. Otherwise, it recursively processes each element in the list, updating the `processing` list to mark elements as processed, and calculates the minimum value returned by recursive calls plus one, which it then assigns to the corresponding position in the `rank` list and returns.

Specifically, it returns a tuple `(x, y, g)` such that `ax + by = g`, where `g` is the GCD of `a` and `b`.

    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, its length `n`, and two integers `m` and `k`. It checks if the value of `k` can be reduced by the sum of the differences between `m` and each element in `a` that is less than `m`. If `k` remains non-negative after this reduction, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.
