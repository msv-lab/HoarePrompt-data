### Reasoning:
Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning using the annotations and the problem description.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to cyclically shift substrings of a binary string to sort it in non-descending order (all 0s followed by all 1s) with the minimum total cost. The cost for shifting a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

#### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution uses a function `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `cost` is initialized to 0. This variable will store the total cost.
   - `one` is initialized to 0. This variable counts the number of '1's encountered so far.

2. **Iterating through the string**:
   - For each character `i` in the string `s`:
     - If `i` is '1', increment the `one` counter.
     - If `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, it means we have encountered a '0' after some '1's. This indicates that we need to move these '1's before the '0' to sort the string. The cost to move these '1's is the length of the substring containing these '1's plus the '0', which is `one + 1`. This cost is added to the total `cost`.

3. **Returning the cost**:
   - The function returns the total `cost` after processing the entire string.

#### Correctness of the Solution:
The logic in `func_1` is based on the observation that whenever a '0' is encountered after some '1's, the cost to sort the substring containing these '1's and the '0' is `one + 1`. This is because we need to perform a cyclic shift of the substring to move all '1's before the '0'. The solution correctly accumulates this cost for each such occurrence.

Let's validate this with the annotated version:
- **State of the program right before the function call**: `s` is a binary string with length between 2 and 2 * 10^5.
- **State inside `func_1`**:
  - `cost` is the sum of `(number of consecutive '1's + 1)` for each segment of consecutive '1's in the string.
  - `one` is 0 at the end of the function.
- **Overall behavior**: The function returns the cost, which is the sum of `(number of consecutive '1's + 1)` for each segment of consecutive '1's in the string.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's verify the solution with one of the examples from the problem statement:
- **Input**: `101011`
- **Processing**:
  - `i = '1'`: `one = 1`
  - `i = '0'`: `cost = 1 + 1 = 2`, `one = 0`
  - `i = '1'`: `one = 1`
  - `i = '0'`: `cost = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4`, `one = 0`
  - `i = '1'`: `one = 1`
  - `i = '1'`: `one = 2`
- **Final cost**: `cost = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7` (However, the correct output is 5, which indicates a discrepancy.)

Upon closer inspection, the logic in the code does not account for the optimal way to shift substrings. The cost calculation should consider the minimal shifts required to move all '1's before all '0's, which is not accurately captured by simply adding `one + 1` for each '0' after '1's.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string. The logic needs to be refined to ensure that the minimal shifts are considered.

#### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
