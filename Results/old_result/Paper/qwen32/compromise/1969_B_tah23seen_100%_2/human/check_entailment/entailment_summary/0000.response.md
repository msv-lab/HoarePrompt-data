Let's analyze the provided program and the execution summary in detail to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's followed by all '1's) using the minimum cost. The cost of sorting a substring is the length of that substring. The goal is to determine the minimum total cost required to achieve a sorted string.

### Program Analysis:
The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the cost of sorting a binary string `s`. The function iterates through the string, keeping track of the number of consecutive '1's encountered. When it encounters a '0' after one or more '1's, it adds the cost of shifting the substring of consecutive '1's plus one to the total cost.

### Detailed Reasoning:
1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0. `cost` will store the total cost, and `one` will count consecutive '1's.
2. **Iteration**: The function iterates through each character `i` in the string `s`.
   - If `i` is '1', it increments the `one` counter.
   - If `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, it means we have encountered a '0' after a sequence of '1's. The cost of shifting this sequence of '1's (plus the '0' that follows) is `one + 1`, and this value is added to `cost`. After adding the cost, `one` is reset to 0 because we are starting a new segment of potential '1's.
3. **Return**: After iterating through the string, the function returns the total `cost`.

### Correctness Verification:
The provided program correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string. Here's why:
- Each segment of consecutive '1's followed by a '0' is considered.
- The cost to shift each segment is accurately calculated as the length of the segment plus one.
- The function correctly resets the `one` counter after processing a segment.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:
- **First Test Case**: `s = "10"`
  - `one` becomes 1, then encounters '0', so `cost` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
  - Output: `2`.
- **Second Test Case**: `s = "0000"`
  - No '1's, so `cost` remains 0.
  - Output: `0`.
- **Third Test Case**: `s = "11000"`
  - `one` becomes 2, then encounters '0', so `cost` becomes `2 + 1 = 3`.
  - Then `one` becomes 1, then encounters '0', so `cost` becomes `3 + (1 + 1) = 5`.
  - Then `one` becomes 1, then encounters '0', so `cost` becomes `5 + (1 + 1) = 7`.
  - Then `one` becomes 1, then encounters '0', so `cost` becomes `7 + (1 + 1) = 9`.
  - Output: `9`.
- **Fourth Test Case**: `s = "101011"`
  - `one` becomes 1, then encounters '0', so `cost` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
  - `one` becomes 1, then encounters '0', so `cost` becomes `2 + (1 + 1) = 4`.
  - `one` becomes 2, then encounters '0', so `cost` becomes `4 + (2 + 1) = 7`.
  - Output: `5` (Note: The provided program does not match the expected output for this case, suggesting a mistake in the program's logic).
- **Fifth Test Case**: `s = "01101001"`
  - `one` becomes 1, then encounters '0', so `cost` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
  - `one` becomes 1, then encounters '0', so `cost` becomes `2 + (1 + 1) = 4`.
  - `one` becomes 1, then encounters '0', so `cost` becomes `4 + (1 + 1) = 6`.
  - `one` becomes 1, then encounters '0', so `cost` becomes `6 + (1 + 1) = 8`.
  - `one` becomes 1, then encounters '0', so `cost` becomes `8 + (1 + 1) = 10`.
  - `one` becomes 1, so `cost` becomes `10 + (1 + 1) = 12`.
  - Output: `11` (Note: The provided program does not match the expected output for this case, suggesting a mistake in the program's logic).

### Conclusion:
The program's logic does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all test cases, as evidenced by the discrepancies in the fourth and fifth test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
