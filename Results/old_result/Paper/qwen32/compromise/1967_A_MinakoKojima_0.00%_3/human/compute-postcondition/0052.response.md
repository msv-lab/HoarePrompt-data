The given code snippet modifies the value of `ans` by multiplying it with `a[i] - a[i - 1]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `k`, `a`, and `m` are not affected by this statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 3; `i` is 3; `k` is the remaining value after all iterations; `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`; `m` is the minimum value in the updated list `a`; `ans` is `a[0] * (a[i] - a[i - 1]) * (a[i] - a[i - 1]) * (a[i] - a[i - 1])`**.

In natural language: The variable `ans` has been updated by multiplying its previous value with `a[i] - a[i - 1]`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `k`, `a`, and `m`) retain their initial values or states as described in the initial conditions.
