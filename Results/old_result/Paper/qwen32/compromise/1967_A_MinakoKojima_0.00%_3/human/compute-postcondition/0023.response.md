The code snippet provided multiplies the current value of `ans` by the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is incremented by 1 before the code snippet executes, so `i` is now `i + 1` from its previous state.

The value of `ans` is updated to `ans * (a[i] - a[i - 1])`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `ans` is `ans * (a[i] - a[i - 1])`.**
