Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `k` is the second integer from the input, and if `k` is greater than or equal to the product of `n` and `m`, `ans` is `math.factorial(n)`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to a value after `n` iterations; `a` is a list of integers read from the input with each element updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` after `n` iterations; `m` is the minimum value in the updated list `a`; `ans` is the product of the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from `a[1] - a[0]` to `a[n-1] - a[n-2]`.**
