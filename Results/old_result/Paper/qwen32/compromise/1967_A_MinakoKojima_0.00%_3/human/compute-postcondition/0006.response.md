Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is `math.factorial(n)`; `k` is greater than or equal to the product of `n` and `m`.**

`ans` is now assigned the value of `math.factorial(n)`. All other variables retain their initial values.
