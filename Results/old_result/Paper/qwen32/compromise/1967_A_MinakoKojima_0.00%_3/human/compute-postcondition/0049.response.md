The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2. The value of `n` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1; `i` is 2; `k` is the remaining value after all iterations; `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`; `m` is the minimum value in the updated list `a`; `ans` is `a[0] * (a[i] - a[i - 1])`**
