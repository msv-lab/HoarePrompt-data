Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^12. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    m = min(a)
    ans = 0
    if k >= n * m:
        ans = math.factorial(n)
    else:
        k -= n * m
        for i in range(n):
            a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
            k -= min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
        ans = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `k` is the second integer from the input, and if `k` is greater than or equal to the product of `n` and `m`, `ans` is `math.factorial(n)`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to a value after `n` iterations; `a` is a list of integers read from the input with each element updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` after `n` iterations; `m` is the minimum value in the updated list `a`; `ans` is the product of the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from `a[1] - a[0]` to `a[n-1] - a[n-2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input. If `k` >= `n` * `m`, `ans` is the factorial of `n`. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`; `m` is the minimum value in the updated list `a`; `ans` is the product of all `(a[i] - a[i-1])` for `i` from 1 to `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `k` is the second integer from the input. If `k` >= `n * m`, `ans` is the factorial of `n`. Otherwise, `k` is reduced to 0 or a value less than the minimum possible reduction in each iteration, `a` is the list after all updates, `m` is the minimum value in the final updated list `a`, and `ans` is the first element of the list `a` multiplied by the product of `(a[i] - a[i-1])` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
