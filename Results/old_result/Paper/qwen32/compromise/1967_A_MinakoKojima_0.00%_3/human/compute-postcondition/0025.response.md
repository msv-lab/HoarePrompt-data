The given code snippet multiplies the current value of `ans` by the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i - 1]`. The variables `t`, `n`, and the initial state of `i` are not directly affected by this operation, but `ans` is updated.

Given the initial state, `i` is incremented by 1 before this code snippet is executed. Therefore, `i` is already in the correct state to access `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `ans` is `ans * (a[i] - a[i - 1])`.**
