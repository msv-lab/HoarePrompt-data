Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`.**

This means that the value of `m` has been determined to be the smallest integer in the list `a`, while all other variables retain their initial values as described.
