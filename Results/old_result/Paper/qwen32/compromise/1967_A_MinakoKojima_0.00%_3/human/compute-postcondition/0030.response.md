The provided Python code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 0 and 99, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, and there are additional conditions and variables (`a`, `m`, `ans`) that depend on further operations not shown in the snippet.

The code snippet only updates the values of `n` and `k` by reading them from the input. Therefore, the new values of `n` and `k` will be whatever integers are provided in the input, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input with each element updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` after `n` iterations; `m` is the minimum value in the updated list `a`; `ans` is the product of the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from `a[1] - a[0]` to `a[n-1] - a[n-2]`.**
