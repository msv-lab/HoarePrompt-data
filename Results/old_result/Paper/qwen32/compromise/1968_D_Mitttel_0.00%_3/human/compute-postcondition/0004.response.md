The code snippet assigns the value `-1` to the variable `cycle_start`. None of the other variables (`start_pos`, `score`, `current_pos`, `steps`, `visited`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`start_pos` is an integer such that 1 <= `start_pos` <= n, where n is the length of the permutation p and the array a; `score` is 0; `current_pos` is equal to `start_pos`; `steps` is 0; `visited` is an empty dictionary; `cycle_start` is -1.**
