The code snippet initializes a variable `steps` to 0. This does not affect the values of `start_pos`, `score`, or `current_pos`. Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the new variable `steps`.

Output State: **`start_pos` is an integer such that 1 <= `start_pos` <= n, where n is the length of the permutation p and the array a; `score` is 0; `current_pos` is equal to `start_pos`; `steps` is 0.**
