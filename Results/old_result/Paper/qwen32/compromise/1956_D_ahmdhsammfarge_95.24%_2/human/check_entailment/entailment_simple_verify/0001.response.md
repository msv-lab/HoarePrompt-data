### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several critical flaws in the provided code. Let's break down the issues and verify the correctness of the program:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function attempts to maximize the sum by choosing a subarray `[i, j]` and computing a new sum based on `(j - i + 1) ** 2`. This approach is incorrect because it does not compute the MEX (minimum excluded value) of the subarray. Instead, it uses a heuristic that does not guarantee the maximum sum.
   - The MEX of a subarray is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray. The function does not calculate this value, which is essential for solving the problem correctly.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function is recursive and adds operations to the list `ops`. However, the logic within this function is not clearly justified by the problem requirements. It does not align with the goal of maximizing the sum by using the MEX value.
   - The recursive calls and the operations added to `ops` do not guarantee that the maximum sum will be achieved.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function performs the operation on the subarray `[r, l]` by setting all elements to `n` (the length of the subarray). This is incorrect because it should set all elements to the MEX value of the subarray.
   - The operations added to `ops` are not justified and do not align with the problem's goal.

4. **Post-processing Loop:**
   - The loop after the main operations attempts to replace any remaining zeros in the list with ones. However, this approach is not guaranteed to maximize the sum and does not align with the problem's goal of using the MEX value.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis above, the provided code does not correctly compute the MEX value for subarrays. The operations performed do not align with the problem's goal of maximizing the sum by using the MEX value. The logic within the functions is flawed and does not guarantee that the maximum sum will be achieved.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
