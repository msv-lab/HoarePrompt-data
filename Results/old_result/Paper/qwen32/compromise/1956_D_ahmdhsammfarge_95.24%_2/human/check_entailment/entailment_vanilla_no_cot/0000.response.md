Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the main issues:

1. **Logic for Calculating MEX**: The program does not correctly calculate the MEX of a subarray. The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set. The program attempts to find the best subarray to replace with a certain value, but it does not calculate the MEX correctly.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum calculation in `func_1` is incorrect. It tries to maximize the sum by replacing a subarray with a square of its length, which is not the correct way to maximize the sum using the MEX operation.

3. **Operation Sequence**: The sequence of operations generated by `func_2` and `func_3` is not correct. The operations should be based on the MEX of the subarray, and the program does not ensure that the operations are optimal or even valid.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the array is already optimal or when the array contains only zeros.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

- Calculate the MEX of each possible subarray.
- Replace the subarray with its MEX to maximize the sum.
- Keep track of the operations performed.

A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible subarrays, calculating their MEX, and performing the operation if it increases the sum. However, given the constraints and the problem's nature, a more efficient approach might be needed, possibly involving dynamic programming or a greedy strategy.
