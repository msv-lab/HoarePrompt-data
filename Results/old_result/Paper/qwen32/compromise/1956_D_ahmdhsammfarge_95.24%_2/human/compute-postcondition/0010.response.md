Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. `r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, and `ops` is a list that will store the operations performed. The function returns the list `lst` where the elements from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) have been replaced by `n` elements, each equal to `n`.**
