Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, and `ops` is a list that will store the operations performed; `ops` now includes the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]`.**

In simple terms, the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` has been added to the `ops` list, while the values of `r`, `l`, and `lst` remain unchanged.
