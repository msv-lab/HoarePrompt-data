The code snippet assigns the list `[i, j]` to the variables `r` and `l`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is 1. Therefore, `r` and `l` will both be assigned the values 0 and 1 respectively. The other variables (`lst`, `over_sum`, `sm`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `r` is 0, `l` is 1, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the iterations, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `sm` is `sum(lst[2:]) + 4`**.
