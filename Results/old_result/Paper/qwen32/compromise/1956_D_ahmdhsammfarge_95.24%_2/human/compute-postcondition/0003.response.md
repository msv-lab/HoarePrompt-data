Postcondition: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, and `ops` is a list that will store the operations performed. The operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` is added to `ops`. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` is added to `ops` a second time.**
