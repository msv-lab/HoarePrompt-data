Postcondition: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers. `r` is 0. If `sm > over_sum`, then `l` is 2, `over_sum` is `sum(lst[3:]) + 9`, `i` is 0, `sm` is `sum(lst[3:]) + 9`, and `j` is 2. Otherwise, `l` retains its original value (0 or 1) based on the initial condition `sm > over_sum`.**
