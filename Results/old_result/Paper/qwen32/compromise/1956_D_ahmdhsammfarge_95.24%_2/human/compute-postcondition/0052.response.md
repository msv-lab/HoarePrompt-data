Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `r` is 0, `l` is 2; `over_sum` is updated to `sm` if `sm` is greater than `over_sum`; `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `sm` is `sum(lst[:0]) + sum(lst[2 + 1:]) + (2 - 0 + 1)`**

In this output state, `r` and `l` have been updated to the values of `i` and `j` respectively, which are 0 and 2. The values of `over_sum`, `i`, `j`, and `sm` remain as they were described in the initial state, with the condition that `over_sum` is updated to `sm` only if `sm` is greater than `over_sum`.
