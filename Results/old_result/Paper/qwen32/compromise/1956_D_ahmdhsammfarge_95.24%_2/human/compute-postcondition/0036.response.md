Postcondition: **`lst` is a list of integers, `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`, `j` is `j + 1`. If `sm` (which is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`) is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is set to `i` and `l` is set to `j`, and `over_sum` is updated to `sm`. Otherwise, `r` and `l` remain unchanged, and `over_sum` is not updated.**
