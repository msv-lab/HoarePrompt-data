The code assigns the values of `i` and `j` to the variables `r` and `l` respectively. The values of `lst`, `i`, `j`, and `sm` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `i` must be less than `len(lst) - 1`, `j` is `j + 1`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`, `r` is `i`, `l` is `j`**.
