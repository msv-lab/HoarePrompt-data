To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the purpose of the loop and how the variables evolve. The loop is designed to find the pair of indices `(i, j)` that maximizes the value of `sm`, which is calculated as the sum of elements before index `i`, the sum of elements after index `j`, and the square of the distance between `i` and `j` plus one.

The loop iterates over all possible pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j`, and for each pair, it calculates `sm` and updates `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` if `sm` is greater than the current `over_sum`.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue to iterate until all possible pairs `(i, j)` have been considered. The final state will be the one where `i` has reached `len(lst) - 1` and `j` has gone through all possible values greater than `i`.

The final output state will be:

- `lst` remains unchanged as it is the input list of integers.
- `r` and `l` will be the indices of the pair `(i, j)` that maximize `sm`.
- `over_sum` will be the maximum value of `sm` found during all iterations.
- `i` will have completed all its iterations, reaching `len(lst) - 1`.
- `j` will have completed all its iterations for the last `i`.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `r` and `l` are the indices of the pair `(i, j)` that maximize `sm`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the iterations, `i` is `len(lst) - 1`, and `j` has completed all possible iterations for the last `i`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `r` and `l` will hold the indices of the pair that gives the maximum `sm`, `over_sum` will be that maximum value, and `i` will have iterated through all possible starting indices, with `j` having iterated through all possible ending indices for each `i`.
