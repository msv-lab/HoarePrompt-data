The code snippet calculates the sum of elements in `lst` up to but not including the index `i`, adds the sum of elements from `lst` starting right after index `j`, and then adds the square of the difference between `j` and `i` plus one. The result of this calculation is stored in the variable `sm`.

Given that `j` is incremented by 1 before this code snippet is executed, the value of `j` is now `j + 1` from the initial state. The variables `lst`, `i`, and `j` are the only relevant variables in this context, and `sm` is newly introduced. The precondition that `i` must be less than `len(lst) - 1` remains valid.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `i` must be less than `len(lst) - 1`, `j` is `j + 1` (incremented by 1 from the initial state), `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`**
