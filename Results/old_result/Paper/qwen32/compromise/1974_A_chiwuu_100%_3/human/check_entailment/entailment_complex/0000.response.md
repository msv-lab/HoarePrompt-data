### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and see if it correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for the given problem.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `x` (number of 1x1 icons) and `y` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Calculation of Screens:**
   - The program first calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon requires 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells (5x3 grid), the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons alone is calculated as `t = b // 2` if `b` is even, or `t = b // 2 + 1` if `b` is odd.
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, the program calculates the remaining cells available on the screens already used for the 2x2 icons (`t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`). 
   - If the remaining cells are enough to place all the 1x1 icons (`t1 >= a`), then `t` remains the same.
   - If not, it calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons (`t2 = a - t1`). The number of additional screens required is `t2 // 15` if `t2` is a multiple of 15, or `t2 // 15 + 1` otherwise.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the total number of screens `t`.

### Verification:

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

- **Test Case 1:** `x = 1, y = 1`
  - `t = 1 // 2 + 1 = 1`
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11` (enough for 1x1 icon)
  - Output: `1`

- **Test Case 2:** `x = 7, y = 2`
  - `t = 2 // 2 = 1`
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7` (enough for 7x1 icons)
  - Output: `1`

- **Test Case 3:** `x = 12, y = 4`
  - `t = 4 // 2 = 2`
  - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 26 - 16 = 10` (not enough for 12x1 icons)
  - `t2 = 12 - 10 = 2`
  - Additional screens needed: `2 // 15 + 1 = 1`
  - Total screens: `2 + 1 = 3` (but the output is `2`. This suggests a potential issue with the logic or an edge case not handled correctly.)

- **Test Case 4:** `x = 0, y = 3`
  - `t = 3 // 2 + 1 = 2`
  - Output: `2`

- **Test Case 5:** `x = 1, y = 0`
  - `t = 0 // 2 = 0`
  - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0` (not enough for 1x1 icon)
  - `t2 = 1 - 0 = 1`
  - Additional screens needed: `1 // 15 + 1 = 1`
  - Total screens: `0 + 1 = 1`
  - Output: `1`

- **Test Case 6:** `x = 8, y = 1`
  - `t = 1 // 2 + 1 = 1`
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11` (enough for 8x1 icons)
  - Output: `1`

- **Test Case 7:** `x = 0, y = 0`
  - `t = 0 // 2 = 0`
  - Output: `0`

- **Test Case 8:** `x = 2, y = 0`
  - `t = 0 // 2 = 0`
  - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0` (not enough for 2x1 icons)
  - `t2 = 2 - 0 = 2`
  - Additional screens needed: `2 // 15 + 1 = 1`
  - Total screens: `0 + 1 = 1`
  - Output: `1`

- **Test Case 9:** `x = 15, y = 0`
  - `t = 0 // 2 = 0`
  - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0` (not enough for 15x1 icons)
  - `t2 = 15 - 0 = 15`
  - Additional screens needed: `15 // 15 = 1`
  - Total screens: `0 + 1 = 1`
  - Output: `1`

- **Test Case 10:** `x = 8, y = 2`
  - `t = 2 // 2 = 1`
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7` (not enough for 8x1 icons)
  - `t2 = 8 - 7 = 1`
  - Additional screens needed: `1 // 15 + 1 = 1`
  - Total screens: `1 + 1 = 2`
  - Output: `2`

- **Test Case 11:** `x = 0, y = 9`
  - `t = 9 // 2 + 1 = 5`
  - Output: `5`

### Conclusion:
The program seems to work correctly for most of the test cases, but there is an issue with Test Case 3 where the expected output is `2` but the program outputs `3`. This suggests that the logic for calculating the additional screens needed for 1x1 icons might need a more detailed check.

**Correctness: False** (due to the issue with Test Case 3 and potentially other edge cases not covered)

Let's correct the program:

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = (b + 1) // 2
        
        # Calculate remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = screens_for_2x2 * 15 - b * 4
        
        # Calculate additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        if remaining_cells >= a:
            total_screens = screens_for_2x2
        else:
            additional_screens = (a - remaining_cells + 14) // 15  # Ceiling division
            total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens
        
        print(total_screens)

# Call the function
func()
```

This corrected program should handle all edge cases correctly.
