Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for the given problem. The logic for determining the number of screens is flawed, especially in how it handles the placement of both 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

Here's a more accurate approach to solve the problem:

1. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. Since each screen is a 5x3 grid, it has a total of 15 cells.
2. We first place all 2x2 icons. Each 2x2 icon requires 4 cells, so we need to determine how many screens are needed just for the 2x2 icons.
3. After placing the 2x2 icons, we need to place the remaining 1x1 icons. We need to account for the remaining cells on the screens after placing 2x2 icons.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = (b + 1) // 2  # Each screen can hold at most 2 2x2 icons
        # Calculate the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
        used_cells = screens_for_2x2 * 4  # Each 2x2 icon uses 4 cells
        # Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can be placed on the remaining cells
        remaining_cells = screens_for_2x2 * 15 - used_cells
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        additional_screens_for_1x1 = (a - remaining_cells + 14) // 15  # Each screen can hold 15 1x1 icons
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens_for_1x1
        print(total_screens)

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed by first placing all 2x2 icons and then placing the remaining 1x1 icons, taking into account the available space on the screens.
