Given the initial state, we know that `i` is set to 2 and `n` is greater than 2. The condition mentioned about `mpp` (presumably a dictionary) and the keys within it does not affect the value of `i` directly. Since the print statement is `print(i)`, the value of `i` will be printed directly.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The value of `i` is explicitly stated as 2.
2. The condition involving `mpp` does not alter the value of `i`.
3. The print statement `print(i)` will output the value of `i`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2**
