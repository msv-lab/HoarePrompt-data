The code snippet contains a `break` statement which will exit the most internal loop or if statement. The variables `i` and `n` are not modified by this statement. The condition regarding `i` and `mpp` does not change the state of the variables, it only affects the control flow of the program.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
