The code snippet provided reassigns the variable `arr` to a new list of integers obtained from the input. This means that the previous value of `arr` (which was stated to remain unchanged in the initial state) is now replaced by the new list of integers.

The other variables `i`, `first`, `n`, and `mpp` remain unchanged as per the provided code snippet.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `first` is `True` if any frequency of `i` in `mpp` was 1 during the iterations, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a new list of integers from the input, `mpp` remains unchanged.**
