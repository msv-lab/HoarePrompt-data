Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is `True`; `i` is a key in `mpp` with `mpp[i]` equal to 1; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables do not change, but the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
