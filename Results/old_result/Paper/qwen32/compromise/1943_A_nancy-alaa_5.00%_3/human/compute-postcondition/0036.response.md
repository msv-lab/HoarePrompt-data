The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's continuation. The loop's continuation depends on the range generated by `int(input())`. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration is `n-1`, this suggests that the loop has iterated `n-1` times so far. For the loop to execute one more time, the total number of iterations (determined by `int(input())`) must be at least `n`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that the input to the `range` function is at least `n`.

State: **`n`**
