The code snippet creates a `Counter` object named `mpp` from the list `arr`. This `Counter` object will count the occurrences of each integer in the list `arr`. The values of `n` and `arr` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr`.**
