Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the condition `n` must be greater than `i + 1` remains unchanged. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
