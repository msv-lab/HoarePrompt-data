Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob to maximize and minimize the MEX score, respectively. Here are a few issues and potential cases where the program fails:

1. **Incorrect Handling of MEX Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to find the MEX by iterating through numbers and checking their presence in the `Counter` object. However, it does not correctly simulate the game where Alice tries to maximize the MEX and Bob tries to minimize it.

2. **Lack of Simulation of the Game**:
   - The code does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob, which is crucial to determine the final MEX score. Alice and Bob's strategies affect the final composition of the array `c`.

3. **Edge Cases Not Considered**:
   - The code does not handle cases where all elements are the same, or where the array contains elements in a way that forces a specific MEX value.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

**Input**:
```
1
5
0 0 0 0 1
```

**Expected Output**:
```
1
```

**Explanation**:
- Alice can pick `1` first, making `c = [1]` and `a = [0, 0, 0, 0]`.
- Bob picks any `0`, making `c = [1]` and `a = [0, 0, 0]`.
- Alice picks another `0`, making `c = [1, 0]` and `a = [0, 0]`.
- Bob picks another `0`, making `c = [1, 0]` and `a = [0]`.
- Alice picks the last `0`, making `c = [1, 0, 0]` and `a = []`.
- The MEX of `[1, 0, 0]` is `2`, but the optimal strategy leads to a MEX of `1`.

The provided code does not simulate this optimal play and thus fails to produce the correct output for this case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
