arr is a list of test cases where each test case is represented as a list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), a list a of length n (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9), and a list b of length n (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9). The first element of arr is the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
