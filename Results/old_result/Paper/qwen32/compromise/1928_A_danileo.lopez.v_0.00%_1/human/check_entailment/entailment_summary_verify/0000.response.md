Let's analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Analysis
Bob has a rectangle of size `a x b`. He can cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. He then tries to form a new rectangle from these two smaller rectangles. The key points are:
- If either dimension (`a` or `b`) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle in such a way that he can form a new rectangle.
- If both dimensions are odd, the resulting smaller rectangles will have at least one odd dimension, making it impossible to form a new rectangle different from the original.

### Code Analysis
The provided code reads `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `a` and `b`. It checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If so, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Function Summary
The function summary states that the function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it prints "Yes" if at least one of the integers is even, otherwise it prints "No".

### Original Assessment
The original assessment claims that the program correctly determines if Bob can form another rectangle by checking if either dimension is even. It provides a detailed explanation of why this logic works.

### Verification
Let's verify the logic provided in the original assessment:
1. **Even Dimension Case**:
   - If `a` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of size `a/2 x b`. These two rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of size `a x (b/2)`.
   - If `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of size `a x b/2`. These two rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of size `(a/2) x b`.
   
2. **Odd Dimension Case**:
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, any possible cut will result in smaller rectangles with at least one odd dimension. It is impossible to rearrange these to form a new rectangle different from the original one.

### Conclusion
The original assessment correctly explains the logic and reasoning behind the program's correctness. The program accurately checks if either dimension is even and correctly determines if Bob can form a new rectangle.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided logic.
