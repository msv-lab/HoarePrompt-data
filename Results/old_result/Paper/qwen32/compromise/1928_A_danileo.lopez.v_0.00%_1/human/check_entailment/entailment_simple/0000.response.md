### Reasoning:
To determine if Bob can form a new rectangle by cutting his original rectangle and rearranging the resulting pieces, we need to analyze the conditions under which this is possible.

When Bob cuts the rectangle, he can either cut it horizontally or vertically. If he cuts horizontally, he will get two rectangles of dimensions \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) (if \(b\) is even) or two rectangles of dimensions \(a \times (b-1)\) and \(a \times 1\) (if \(b\) is odd). Similarly, if he cuts vertically, he will get two rectangles of dimensions \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) (if \(a\) is even) or two rectangles of dimensions \((a-1) \times b\) and \(1 \times b\) (if \(a\) is odd).

From the problem description, we can infer the following:
- If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can always form a new rectangle. For example, if \(a\) is even, he can cut the rectangle into two \(a/2 \times b\) rectangles and then combine them to form a new rectangle of dimensions \(a/2 \times 2b\).
- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the only rectangles he can form from the resulting \(a \times 1\) and \(1 \times b\) pieces are \(a \times b\) or \(b \times a\), which are the same rectangle as the original.

Thus, the condition for Bob to be able to form a new rectangle is that at least one of the dimensions \(a\) or \(b\) must be even.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even and printing "Yes" if so, otherwise printing "No".
