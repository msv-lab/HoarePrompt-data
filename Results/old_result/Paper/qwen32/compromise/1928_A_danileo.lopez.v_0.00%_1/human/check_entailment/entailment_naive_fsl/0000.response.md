Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly determines if Bob can form another rectangle from the given a x b rectangle by checking if either dimension (a or b) is even. If either dimension is even, it is possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new rectangle from them. Conversely, if both dimensions are odd, it is impossible to form a new rectangle.

Here's why the logic works:
- If `a` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of size `a/2 x b`. These two rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of size `a x (b/2)`.
- If `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of size `a x b/2`. These two rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of size `(a/2) x b`.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, the resulting smaller rectangles from any possible cut will have at least one odd dimension, and it is impossible to rearrange them into a new rectangle that is different from the original one.

The program correctly handles all edge cases and potential inputs within the given constraints.
