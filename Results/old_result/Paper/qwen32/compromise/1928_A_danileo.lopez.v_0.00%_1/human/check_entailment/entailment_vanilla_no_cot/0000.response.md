To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the problem and the logic implemented in the code.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob has a rectangle of size `a x b`. He wants to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he tries to form another rectangle using the two resulting rectangles.

The key point is that if Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a different rectangle (not just a 90-degree rotation of the original), then the answer is "Yes". Otherwise, it's "No".

### Conditions for Forming a Different Rectangle:
- If either `a` or `b` is even, then Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a different rectangle.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, then Bob cannot form a different rectangle because the only possible cuts will result in two smaller rectangles of size `a x 1` or `1 x b`, which can only form the same rectangle when rearranged (either `a x b` or `b x a`).

### Code Analysis:
The provided code checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If either is even, it prints "Yes". If both are odd, it prints "No".

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Conclusion:
The logic in the code correctly implements the conditions derived from the problem analysis. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
