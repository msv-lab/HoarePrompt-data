Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a list, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each element is between 0 and 10^9. The function processes each test case and returns an output based on the values in the list `a`.**
