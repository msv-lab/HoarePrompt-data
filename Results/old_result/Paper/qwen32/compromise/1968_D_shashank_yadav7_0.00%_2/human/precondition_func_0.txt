t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n, k, P_B, and P_S are integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. p is a list of n integers such that 1 <= p_i <= n for each i from 1 to n. a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
