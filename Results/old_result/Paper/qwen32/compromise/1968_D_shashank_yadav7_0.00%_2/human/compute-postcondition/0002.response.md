The code snippet assigns the values from the input, which are split into four integers, to the variables `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`. The initial values of `t` and `i` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value obtained from the input, which must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are the four integers obtained from the input.**
