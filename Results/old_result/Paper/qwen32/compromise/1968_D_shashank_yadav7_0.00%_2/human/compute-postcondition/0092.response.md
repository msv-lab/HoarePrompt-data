The code snippet `bp += a[b]` increments the value of `bp` by the value of `a[b]`. Given the initial state, `bp` was previously calculated as `3 * a[b]`. After the increment, `bp` becomes `3 * a[b] + a[b]`, which simplifies to `4 * a[b]`.

Here is the updated output state with all other variables remaining unchanged:
Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a new list of integers from the input, `bm` is `2 * a[b]` if `a[b]` is non-negative, otherwise `bm` is `0`, `sm` is `4 * a[s]`, `sp` is `3 * a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `4 * a[b]`.**
