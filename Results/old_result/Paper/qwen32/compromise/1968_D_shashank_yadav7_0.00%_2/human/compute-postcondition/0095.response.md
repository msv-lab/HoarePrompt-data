Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Variables and their relationships:**
   - `t` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `i` is `k`, which is 0.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - `b` is defined through a nested operation based on `k`. Since `k` is 0, `b` simplifies to `p[0] - 1`.
   - `s` is also defined through a nested operation based on `k`. Since `k` is 0, `s` simplifies to `p[0] - 1`.
   - `p` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `a` is a new list of integers from the input.
   - `bm` is the maximum value accumulated over `k` iterations, which is 0 since `k` is 0.
   - `sm` is the maximum value accumulated over `k` iterations, which is 0 since `k` is 0.
   - `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for `k` iterations, which is 0 since `k` is 0.
   - `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for `k` iterations, which is 0 since `k` is 0.
   - `bm` is greater than `sm`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('Bodya')`.

### Analysis:
- The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or computations. It simply prints the string `'Bodya'`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'Bodya'`.

Output: **Bodya**
