The code snippet `bp += a[b]` increments the value of `bp` by the value of `a[b]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the value of `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the input minus 3, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp) + bm`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`, `sp` is `sp + a[s]`.**
