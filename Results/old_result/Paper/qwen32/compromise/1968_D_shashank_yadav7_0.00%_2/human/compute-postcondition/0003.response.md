The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `p`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, or `s`. It only introduces a new list `p` containing the integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value obtained from the input, which must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are the four integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
