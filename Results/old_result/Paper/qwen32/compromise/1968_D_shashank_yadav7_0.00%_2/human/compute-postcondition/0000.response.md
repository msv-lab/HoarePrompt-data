Output State: **`t` is the integer value obtained from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The constraints for `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged.**

In simple terms, the variable `t` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which indicates how many test cases will be processed. All other variables and their constraints remain as initially described.
