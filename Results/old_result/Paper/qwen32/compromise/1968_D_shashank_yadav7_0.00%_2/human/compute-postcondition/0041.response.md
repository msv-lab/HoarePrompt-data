The code snippet `bp += a[b]` increments the variable `bp` by the value of `a[b]`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer greater than 0
- `i` is 2
- `n` is greater than 0
- `k` is `k - 1`
- `s` is `p[s] - 1`
- `b` is `p[b] - 1`
- `p`, `a`, `sp`, and `bp` remain as described in the initial state
- `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`
- `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`
- `sp` is `sp + 3 * a[s]`
- `bp` is `bp + 2 * a[b]`

After the execution of `bp += a[b]`, the value of `bp` is further incremented by `a[b]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is `k - 1`; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `p`, `a`, `sp` remain as described in the initial state; `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`; `sp` is `sp + 3 * a[s]`; `bp` is `bp + 3 * a[b]`.**
