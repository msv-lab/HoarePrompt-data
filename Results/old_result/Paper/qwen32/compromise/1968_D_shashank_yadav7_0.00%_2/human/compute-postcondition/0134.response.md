The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3. The value of `n` must still be greater than 3 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the input minus 2, `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`, `sp` is `sp + a[s]`**
