Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is `k - 1`; `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`; `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`; `p`, `a`, `sp`, and `bp` remain as described in the initial state; if `k == 0`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * (k - 1) + bp)`; `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * (k - 1) + sp)`; `sp` is `sp + 2 * a[s]`; `bp` is `bp + 2 * a[b]`. Otherwise, `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`; `sp` is `sp + 2 * a[s]`; `bp` is `bp + 2 * a[b]`.**
