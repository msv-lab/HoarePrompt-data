The code snippet `sp += a[s]` increments the value of `sp` by the value of `a[s]`. Given the initial state, `sp` is initially `2 * a[s]`. After the operation, `sp` becomes `2 * a[s] + a[s]`, which simplifies to `3 * a[s]`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a new list of integers from the input, `bm` is `max(0, a[b])`, `sm` is `2 * a[s]`, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`**.
