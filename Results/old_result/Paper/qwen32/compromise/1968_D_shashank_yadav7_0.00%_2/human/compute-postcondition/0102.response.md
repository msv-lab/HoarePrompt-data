Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `k` (which is 0), `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `b` is `p[0] - 1`, `s` is `p[0] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a new list of integers from the input, `bm` is the maximum value accumulated over `k` iterations (which is 0 since `k` is 0), `sm` is the maximum value accumulated over `k` iterations (which is 0 since `k` is 0), `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for `k` iterations (which is 0 since `k` is 0), `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for `k` iterations (which is 0 since `k` is 0). If `bm` is greater than `sm`, the condition holds; otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.**
