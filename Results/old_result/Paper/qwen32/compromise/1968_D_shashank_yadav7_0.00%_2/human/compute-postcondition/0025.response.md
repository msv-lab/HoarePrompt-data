Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is -1 if the initial value of `k` was 0, otherwise `k` is `k - 1`; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `p`, `a`, `sp`, and `sm` remain as described in the initial state; if `k` is 0, `bm` is `max(bm, bp)`; if `k` is not 0, `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`; `sp` is `sp + a[s]`; `bp` is `bp + a[b]`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes, considering the conditions and operations specified in the if part. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains consistent with the if part's postcondition.
