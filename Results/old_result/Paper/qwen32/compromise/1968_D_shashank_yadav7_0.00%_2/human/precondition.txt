t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements (n, k, P_B, P_S) and two lists (p, a). For each tuple, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^9, P_B and P_S are integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n. The list p contains n integers such that 1 <= p_i <= n for all i, and the list a contains n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
