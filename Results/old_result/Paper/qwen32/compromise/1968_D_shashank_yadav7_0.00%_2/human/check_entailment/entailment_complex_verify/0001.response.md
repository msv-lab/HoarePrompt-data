### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the original assessment and the program's behavior based on the annotations to determine if the program is correct.

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, the length of the permutation, the number of turns, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It also reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Index Adjustment**:
   - The program correctly adjusts the starting positions `P_B` and `P_S` to be zero-based indices by subtracting 1 from them.

3. **Initial Scores**:
   - The program initializes the scores of Bodya (`bp`) and Sasha (`sp`) with the values from the array `a` at their starting positions.

4. **Game Simulation**:
   - The program enters a loop to simulate the game for `k` turns.
   - **Critical Issue**: The loop logic is flawed. The lines `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` are incorrect. The `max` function is not appropriate here. Instead, the scores should simply be incremented by the values from the array `a` at the current positions.
   - **Detailed Analysis**:
     - `bm += a[b]`: This should add the value at Bodya's current position to his score.
     - `sm += a[s]`: This should add the value at Sasha's current position to his score.
     - The current logic incorrectly tries to maximize the score with an unrelated calculation.
     - Additionally, the lines `sp += a[s]` and `bp += a[b]` are redundant and incorrect because the scores should only be updated with the current position's value, not added again.

5. **Comparison of Scores**:
   - After the loop, the program correctly compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the winner or "Draw" if the scores are equal.

### Conclusion:
The program contains logical errors in the game simulation loop. The scores are not being updated correctly according to the rules of the game. The use of the `max` function does not align with the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
