Postcondition: **`test_cases` is 0, `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer, `num_list` remains unchanged as the loop only reads from it, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `total_count` is updated to `total_count + cnt`, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.**
