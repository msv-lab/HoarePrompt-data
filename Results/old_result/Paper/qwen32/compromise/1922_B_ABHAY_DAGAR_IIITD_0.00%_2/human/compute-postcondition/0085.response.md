To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's break down the loop's behavior and how it updates the variables.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `test_cases`: 0 (remains unchanged)
   - `n`: unchanged (input integer)
   - `num_list`: unchanged (input list, only read from)
   - `num_of_lens`: dictionary with counts of each integer in `num_list`
   - `res`: 0
   - `total_count`: 0

2. **Loop Iteration:**
   - For each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`:
     - If `cnt >= 3`, update `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`
     - If `cnt >= 2`, update `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`
     - Update `total_count` by adding `cnt`

### Final Output State:
After all iterations, the loop will have processed each value in `num_of_lens.values()`. Therefore, the final values of `res` and `total_count` will be fully computed based on the conditions inside the loop.

- `test_cases` remains 0.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `num_list` remains unchanged.
- `num_of_lens` remains unchanged.
- `res` is the sum of contributions from all `cnt` values in `num_of_lens.values()` according to the conditions.
- `total_count` is the sum of all `cnt` values in `num_of_lens.values()`.

### Calculation:
Let's formalize the final state:
- `total_count` will be the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`, i.e., `total_count = sum(num_of_lens.values())`.
- `res` will be computed as follows:
  - For each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`:
    - If `cnt >= 3`, add `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to `res`.
    - If `cnt >= 2`, add `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count_before_this_cnt` to `res`.

### Final Output State:
Given the above, the final output state will be:
- `test_cases`: 0
- `n`: unchanged
- `num_list`: unchanged
- `num_of_lens`: unchanged
- `res`: computed as described above
- `total_count`: sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`

**Output State: **`test_cases` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, `num_list` remains unchanged, `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `res` is the sum of contributions from all `cnt` values in `num_of_lens.values()` according to the conditions, and `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens.values()`.**
