The given code snippet updates the value of `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to it. The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, `total_count`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged unless they are directly involved in the calculation or assignment in the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is the updated total count based on the previous `cnt` plus `cnt`, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, `cnt` is `next_cnt` where `next_cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is less than 3, no additional updates are made to `res` based on the condition `cnt >= 3`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. All other variables retain their initial states.
