The only variable in the loop head is `cnt`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the loop, `cnt` takes on each value from `num_of_lens.values()` in sequence. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` was the last value from `num_of_lens.values()`. For the loop to execute again, there must be another value in `num_of_lens.values()` to assign to `cnt`.

Let's assume that `num_of_lens` has more than one value, and the next value after the last `cnt` is the new `cnt` for the next iteration.

State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is the updated total count based on the previous `cnt` plus `cnt`, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is further updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`**.

Since we need to adjust only `cnt` for the next iteration, and assuming there is another value in `num_of_lens.values()`, let's denote this new value as `next_cnt`.

State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is the updated total count based on the previous `cnt` plus `cnt`, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is further updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `cnt` is `next_cnt` where `next_cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`**.

Since the exact value of `next_cnt` is not specified, we leave it as `next_cnt` in the state description.
