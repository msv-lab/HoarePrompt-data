The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] += 1` increments the count of the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` by 1. This means that the value associated with the key `x` in `num_of_lens` will be increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers converted from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the value associated with the key `x` is incremented by 1, `res` is the sum of contributions from all `cnt` values in `num_of_lens.values()` and is incremented by 1, `total_count` is incremented by 1, `results` contains `res` as its last element, which is incremented by 1, `x` is the next element in `num_list`.**
