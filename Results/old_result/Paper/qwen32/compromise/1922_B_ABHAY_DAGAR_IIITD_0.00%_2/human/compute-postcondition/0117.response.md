Output State: **`test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is `total_count` + `cnt`, `results` contains `res` as its last element, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`**

Natural Language: The value of `res` has been updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to it. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
