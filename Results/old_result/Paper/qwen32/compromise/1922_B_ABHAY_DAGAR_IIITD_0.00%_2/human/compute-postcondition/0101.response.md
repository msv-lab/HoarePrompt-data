The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `num_list`. If `num_list` has more elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the last element in `num_list`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num_list` must have at least one more element.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:
- `x` should be the next element in `num_list`.

State: **`test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers converted from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where `x` is a key. If `x` was already in `num_of_lens`, its value is incremented by 1; otherwise, it is added with a value of 1. `res` is the sum of contributions from all `cnt` values in `num_of_lens.values()` and is incremented by 1. `total_count` is incremented by 1. `results` contains `res` as its last element, which is incremented by 1. `x` is the next element in `num_list`.**
