The only variable in the loop head is `cnt`, which iterates over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`. For the loop to execute, `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair. Therefore, we need to ensure that `num_of_lens` contains at least one entry.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `res` is 0, `total_count` is 0**

Since the loop iterates over the values of `num_of_lens`, having at least one entry in `num_of_lens` ensures that the loop will execute.
