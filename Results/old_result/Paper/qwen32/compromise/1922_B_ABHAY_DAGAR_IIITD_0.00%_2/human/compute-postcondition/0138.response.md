Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a list, and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each element is between 0 and `n`. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values in the list for each tuple.**
