Postcondition: **`test_cases` will be 0, `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer, `num_list` remains unchanged as the loop only reads from it, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair (e.g., `{1: 1}`), `res` is 0, `total_count` is 0, and `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.**
