The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the `results` list has more elements, the loop will execute again for the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list containing the computed `res` for each test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least 2 elements, and `result` will be the second element in the list.

State: **`results` is a list containing the computed `res` for each test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 2 elements**
