The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] = 1` sets the value of the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` to 1. This means that if `x` was already in the dictionary, its value is now 1, and if `x` was not in the dictionary, it is added with a value of 1.

Since `total_count` is incremented by 1 if `x` was already in `num_of_lens` or set to 1 if `x` was not in `num_of_lens`, and since we are setting `num_of_lens[x]` to 1, `total_count` will be incremented by 1 if `x` was already in `num_of_lens` or set to 1 if `x` was not in `num_of_lens`.

The value of `res` is the sum of contributions from all `cnt` values in `num_of_lens.values()`. Since we are setting `num_of_lens[x]` to 1, `res` will be incremented by 1.

The `results` list contains `res` as its last element. Therefore, after updating `res`, the last element of `results` will be updated to the new value of `res`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers converted from the input and must have at least 1 element, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where `x` is a key with a value of 1, `res` is incremented by 1, `total_count` is incremented by 1 if `x` was already in `num_of_lens` or set to 1 if `x` was not in `num_of_lens`, and `results` contains `res` as its last element, `x` is the next element in `num_list`.**
