The only object in the loop head is the variable `cnt`, which iterates over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `cnt` to the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `test_cases` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least one element
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair
- `total_count` is the previous `total_count` + `cnt`
- `results` contains `res` as its last element
- `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`
- If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`
- If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged

At the start of the next iteration, `cnt` should be updated to the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`. Since we do not have specific values for `num_of_lens`, we assume that there is another value to iterate over.

State: **`test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is the previous `total_count` + `cnt`, `results` contains `res` as its last element, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`**
