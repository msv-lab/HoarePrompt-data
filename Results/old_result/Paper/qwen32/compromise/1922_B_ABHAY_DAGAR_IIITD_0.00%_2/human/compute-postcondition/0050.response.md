The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` by 1. The values of `test_cases`, `n`, and `num_list` remain unchanged. The only change is in the value associated with the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and specifically one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers that must contain at least one integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary and `x` is a key in `num_of_lens` with its value incremented by 1.**
