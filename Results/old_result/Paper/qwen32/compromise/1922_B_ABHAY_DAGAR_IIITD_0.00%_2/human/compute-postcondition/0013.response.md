The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] = 1` sets the value of the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` to `1`. This means that if `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens`, its value is now `1`, and if `x` was not a key in `num_of_lens`, it is added as a key with the value `1`.

The values of the other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, and `num_list`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least two integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key `x` (the second element in `num_list`) has the value `1`.**
