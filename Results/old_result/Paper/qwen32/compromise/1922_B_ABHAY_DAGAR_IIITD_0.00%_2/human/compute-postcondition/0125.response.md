Output State: **`test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is the previous `total_count` + `cnt`, `results` contains `res` as its last element. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is the previous `res` + `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`. `res` is updated to the previous `res` + `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.**

In natural language: The value of `res` has been updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
