Output State: **`test_cases` is 0, `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer, `num_list` remains unchanged as the loop only reads from it, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `total_count` is updated to `total_count + cnt`, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, the previous update to `res` also includes `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to it. The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, `total_count`, and `cnt` remain as they were described in the initial state, with `total_count` having been incremented by `cnt` and `res` updated based on the new value of `total_count`.
