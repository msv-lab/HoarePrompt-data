The code sets `total_count` to 0, which changes its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers converted from the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each unique element in `num_list` is a key, and the value is the count of that element in `num_list`, `res` is 0, `total_count` is 0, `results` contains `res` as its last element.**
