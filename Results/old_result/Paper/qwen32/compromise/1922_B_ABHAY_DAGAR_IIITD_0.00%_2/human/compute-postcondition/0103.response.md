The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] = 1` sets the value of the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` to 1. This means that if `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens`, its value is now 1, and if `x` was not a key in `num_of_lens`, it is added with a value of 1.

The other variables (`test_cases`, `n`, `num_list`, `res`, `total_count`, `results`) are not affected by this statement.

Output State: **`test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers converted from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where `x` is a key with a value of 1, `res` is the sum of contributions from all `cnt` values in `num_of_lens.values()` and is incremented by 1, `total_count` is incremented by 1, `results` contains `res` as its last element, which is incremented by 1, `x` is the next element in `num_list`.**
