The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a result based on the frequency of elements in the list and prints this result. Specifically, it computes the number of ways to choose 3 elements of the same value and adds it to the number of ways to choose 2 elements of the same value multiplied by the total count of elements processed so far. After processing all test cases, all results are printed.
