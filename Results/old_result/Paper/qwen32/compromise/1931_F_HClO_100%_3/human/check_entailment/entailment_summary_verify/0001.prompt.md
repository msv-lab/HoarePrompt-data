You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n people in the programming contest chat. Chat participants are
ordered by activity, but each person sees himself at the top of the list.

For example, there are 4 participants in the chat, and their order is [2, 3,
1, 4] . Then

  * 1 -st user sees the order [1, 2, 3, 4] . 
  * 2 -nd user sees the order [2, 3, 1, 4] . 
  * 3 -rd user sees the order [3, 2, 1, 4] . 
  * 4 -th user sees the order [4, 2, 3, 1] . 

k people posted screenshots in the chat, which show the order of participants
shown to this user. The screenshots were taken within a short period of time,
and the order of participants has not changed.

Your task is to determine whether there is a certain order that all
screenshots correspond to.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains two integers n
and k (1 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5, n \cdot k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of chat participants and the number of participants who posted
screenshots.

The following k lines contain descriptions of screenshots posted by the
participants.

The i -th row contains n integers a_{ij} each (1 \le a_{ij} \le n , all a_{ij}
are different) — the order of participants shown to the participant a_{i0} ,
where a_{i0} — the author of the screenshot. You can show that in the
screenshot description it will always be at the top of the list.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot k for all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . It is also guaranteed that all the authors of the screenshots
are different.

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
an answer, output "YES" if there exists at least one order of participants,
under which all k screenshots could have been obtained. Otherwise, output
"NO".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a set of screenshots with distinct authors. For each test case, it determines whether the order of authors in the screenshots can be consistent across all lists provided. It prints 'yes' if the order can be consistent and 'no' otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given Python program correctly solves the problem, let's analyze its logic step-by-step.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine if there exists a consistent ordering of participants such that all given screenshots match this ordering when the person taking the screenshot is placed at the top.
- Each screenshot shows the participants in a specific order, with the person who took the screenshot always appearing first.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Single Screenshot Case**: If only one screenshot is provided, any order is trivially valid because there's no contradiction.
2. **Multiple Screenshots Case**: When multiple screenshots are provided, we need to check if they can all be derived from a single consistent ordering of participants.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Single Screenshot Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of participants) and `k` (number of screenshots).
   - If `k == 1`, it immediately prints "YES" since any single screenshot can be considered valid.

2. **Handling Multiple Screenshots**:
   - The program reads the first two screenshots (`a1, *l1` and `a2, *l2`).
   - It then removes the other participant from each screenshot to compare the remaining lists (`l11` and `l22`). If these lists are not equal, it concludes that the screenshots cannot be consistent and prints "NO".
   - If the lists are equal, it proceeds to find the point where the two lists differ, considering the positions of `a1` and `a2`.
   - Depending on the differences found, it attempts to reconstruct the consistent order by inserting the missing participant back into the list.
   - For additional screenshots, it checks if they match the reconstructed order after removing the participant who took the screenshot.

### Potential Issues:
- **Complexity and Edge Cases**: The program seems to handle basic cases well, but it may not cover all edge cases, especially when dealing with more than two screenshots.
- **Logic for More Than Two Screenshots**: After handling the first two screenshots, the program uses the reconstructed order to validate additional screenshots. However, it doesn't seem to handle cases where more than two screenshots might provide conflicting information beyond just the first two.

### Testing Against Example Input:
Let's consider the provided example input and see how the program handles it:
- **Test Case 1**: Single screenshot, trivially "YES".
- **Test Case 2**: Four screenshots, all consistent with the same order, should return "YES".
- **Test Case 3**: Two screenshots, consistent with the same order, should return "YES".
- **Test Case 4**: Three screenshots, consistent with the same order, should return "YES".
- **Test Case 5**: Two screenshots, inconsistent orders, should return "NO".
- **Test Case 6**: Two screenshots, consistent with the same order, should return "YES".
- **Test Case 7**: Single screenshot, trivially "YES".
- **Test Case 8**: Four screenshots, all consistent with the same order, should return "YES".
- **Test Case 9**: Three screenshots, consistent with the same order, should return "YES".
- **Test Case 10**: Three screenshots, inconsistent orders, should return "NO".

### Conclusion:
While the program seems to handle the basic cases and the provided examples correctly, it may not cover all possible edge cases, particularly when dealing with more than two screenshots that could introduce contradictions.

Given the complexity and potential edge cases, it's challenging to definitively say the program is correct without a comprehensive proof or more extensive testing.
