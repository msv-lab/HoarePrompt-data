Postcondition: **`t` is incremented by 1, `n` must be at least 3, `m` remains the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding those equal to `a1`, `i` is 2. If `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` is 2, `idx2` is 2, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `idx1` is set to 2 and `p1` is set to 1. Otherwise, `idx2` is set to 2 and `p2` is set to 1.`**
