The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or conditions from the initial state. It simply prints the string `'no'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes a list named `val` that contains at least three tuples, all of which are identical and denoted as `(a3, l3)`. The third tuple in the list is also explicitly mentioned as `(a3, l3)`.
2. The code snippet contains only one statement: `print('no')`.
3. This statement directly outputs the string `'no'` without referencing any variables or performing any calculations.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
