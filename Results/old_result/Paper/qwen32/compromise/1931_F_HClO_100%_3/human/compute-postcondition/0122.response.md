The initial state describes a list named `val` that contains at least three tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)`. It also specifies that the current tuple `(a3, l3)` is the second tuple in the list. However, the `print` statement in the provided code snippet does not reference any variables or elements from the list `val`. Instead, it directly prints the string `'no'`.

Therefore, the execution of the `print` statement will output the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
