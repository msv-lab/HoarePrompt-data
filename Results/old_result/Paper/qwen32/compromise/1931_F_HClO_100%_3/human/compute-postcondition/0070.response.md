Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is 5 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `m` remains 1, `n` is at least 2, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `i_end + 2`, `idx1` is set to `i_end + 2` if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, otherwise `idx2` is set to `i_end + 2`, `p1` is set to 1 if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, otherwise `p2` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language Explanation: The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of `t`, `m`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` except for setting `idx1` to `i_end + 2` if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, otherwise setting `idx2` to `i_end + 2`, and setting `p1` to 1 if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, otherwise setting `p2` to 1.
