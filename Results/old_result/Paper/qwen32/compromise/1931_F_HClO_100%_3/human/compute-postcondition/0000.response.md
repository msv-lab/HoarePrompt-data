`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `t` is now an integer representing the number of test cases. The conditions on `n` and `k` for each test case remain unchanged as they are not yet defined or modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5. Each of the k lines contains n distinct integers a_{ij} each such that 1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n, where a_{i0} is the author of the screenshot and appears at the top of the list. All the authors of the screenshots are different.**
