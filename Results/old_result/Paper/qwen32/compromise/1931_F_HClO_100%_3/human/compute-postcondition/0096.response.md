The code snippet inserts `a1` into the list `l1` at the position specified by `idx2`. This means that the element at `idx2` and all subsequent elements in `l1` will be shifted one position to the right.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `l1`. All other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is 2 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `m` remains 1, `n` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `idx1` is either `n - 2` or -1, `idx2` is not -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first integer from the new input line, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`.**
