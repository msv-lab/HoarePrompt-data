Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the first integer from the input, `m` remains the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding those equal to `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is incremented by 1, `n` must be at least 2, `m` remains the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding those equal to `a1`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, the loop or if statement continues. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to `i`, `p1` and `p2` are both set to 0, and the loop or if statement breaks. Otherwise, `idx1` and `idx2` may not both be non-negative.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is incremented by 1, `n` must be at least 3, `m` remains the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding those equal to `a1`, `i` is 2. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, no further changes are made to `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, or `p2`. If `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` is 2, `idx2` is 2, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `idx1` is set to 2 and `p1` is set to 1. Otherwise, `idx2` is set to 2 and `p2` is set to 1.`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is incremented by 1, `n` must be at least 3, `m` remains the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding those equal to `a1`, `i` is 3. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, no further changes are made to `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, or `p2`. If `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]` and `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `idx1` is 3, `idx2` is 3, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, `idx1` is 3 and `p1` is 1, otherwise `idx2` is 3 and `p2` is 1. If `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
