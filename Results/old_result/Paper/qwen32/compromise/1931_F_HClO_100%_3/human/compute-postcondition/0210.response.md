The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value of `a2` at the position `idx1` in the list `l2`. This operation modifies the list `l2` by adding one more element at the specified index.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `l2`. The value of `a2` is inserted at the position `idx1` in `l2`.

Output State: **t is incremented by 1, n remains the first integer from the input, m remains the second integer from the input, a1 is the first integer from the new input, l1 is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, a2 is the first integer from the latest input, l2 is a list containing elements from the latest input with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, l11 is a list containing elements from l1 excluding those equal to a2, l22 is a list containing elements from l2 excluding those equal to a1. If `idx2 == -1 and idx1 != -1`, then `idx1` is set to `n - 2` and `idx2` is set to `n - 2`. Otherwise, `idx1` remains -1 and `idx2` remains unchanged. Additionally, `idx1 < idx2`. p1 is 0, p2 is 0, val is an empty list.**
