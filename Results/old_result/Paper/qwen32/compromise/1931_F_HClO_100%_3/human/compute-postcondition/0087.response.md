The code snippet inserts the value of `a1` into the list `l1` at the index specified by `idx2`. This means that the element at `idx2` and all subsequent elements in `l1` are shifted one position to the right.

Given the initial state, `idx2` is not -1, and `idx1` is greater than `idx2`. After the insertion, `idx1` will still be greater than `idx2` because the insertion does not affect the position of `idx1`.

Here's the updated state:
- `l1` now contains `a1` inserted at position `idx2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is 5 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `m` remains 1, `n` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at `idx2`, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `idx1` is either `n - 2` or -1, `idx2` is not -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is an empty list. If `idx2` was -1 and `idx1` was not -1, then both `idx1` and `idx2` are updated to `n - 2`. Additionally, `idx1` is greater than `idx2`.**
