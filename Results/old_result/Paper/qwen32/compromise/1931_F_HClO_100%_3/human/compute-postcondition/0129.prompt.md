Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, m is 5, n is an integer read from the input, a1 is the first integer from the new input line, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is the first integer from the new input line, l11 is a list containing elements from l1 excluding all occurrences of a2, l22 is a list containing elements from l2 excluding all occurrences of a1, idx1 is either n - 2 or -1, idx2 is not -1, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, val is a list containing three tuples [(a3, l3), (a3, l3), (a3, l3)], a3 is the first integer from the new input line, l3 is a list of integers from the new input line excluding the first integer.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `val` is a list containing at least one tuple, specifically `[(a3, l3), (a3, l3), (a3, l3)]`. If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `val` is a list containing at least one tuple, specifically `[(a3, l3), (a3, l3), (a3, l3)]`, and the current tuple `(a3, l3)` is the second tuple in the list. If `l3` is not equal to `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the control continues as per the subsequent code after the if-else block.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `val` is a list containing at least three tuples, specifically `[(a3, l3), (a3, l3), (a3, l3)]`, and the current tuple `(a3, l3)` is the third tuple in the list. If `l3` is not equal to the list `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change occurs in the control flow related to the if-else block.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
