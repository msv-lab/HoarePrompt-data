Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the first integer from the input, `m` remains the second integer from the input, `val` contains `m - 2` tuples `(a3, l3)` from the loop iterations, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and other variables (`a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l`) are updated based on the loop conditions but do not affect the final output state described here.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 3, `val` contains `m - 2` tuples `(a3, l3)`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed. If `l3` is not equal to the modified list, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 3, `val` contains `m - 2` tuples `(a3, l3)`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed. The current `(a3, l3)` is the next tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the first integer from the input, `m` is at least 3, `val` contains the remaining tuples `(a3, l3)`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and the current `(a3, l3)` is the next tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list obtained by removing `a3` from `l`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
