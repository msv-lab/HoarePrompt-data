To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's analyze the behavior of the loop based on the given conditions and the provided output states after the first three iterations.

### Key Points from the Loop Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs `n-1` times, but it can break early if certain conditions are met.
2. **Break Conditions**:
   - If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the loop breaks.
   - If `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1`, both `idx1` and `idx2` are set to `i`, and the loop breaks.
   - If `idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0`, the loop breaks.
3. **Variable Updates**:
   - `p1` and `p2` are updated based on whether `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1`.
   - `idx1` and `idx2` are set to `i` when specific matches are found.

### Final Output State Analysis:
Given the conditions and the behavior described, the loop will continue until one of the break conditions is met. Let's consider the possible scenarios:

1. **Scenario where the loop runs until completion without breaking**:
   - This happens if none of the break conditions are met within the `n-1` iterations.
   - In this case, `i` will reach `n-2`, and the loop will terminate naturally.

2. **Scenario where the loop breaks due to `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`**:
   - This condition ensures that the loop terminates early if the combined offset (`max(p1, p2)`) reaches the last index.

3. **Scenario where the loop breaks due to finding matching pairs**:
   - If `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1`, the loop breaks, and `idx1` and `idx2` are set to `i`.

4. **Scenario where the loop breaks due to `idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0`**:
   - If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, the loop breaks.

### Conclusion:
The final output state depends on which of these scenarios occurs. However, since the problem asks for the output state after all iterations, we assume the loop runs until completion unless explicitly broken.

### Final Output State:
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `t` is incremented by `m - 2` for each iteration.
- `val` remains unchanged unless `l11` equals `l22`.
- `p1` and `p2` are updated based on the conditions inside the loop.
- `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged.
- `l1` and `l2` remain unchanged.
- `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged.
- `idx1` and `idx2` are set to `i` if the matching condition is met; otherwise, they remain `-1`.
- `i` will be `n-2` if the loop completes all iterations.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `t` is incremented by `m - 2` for each iteration, `val` is unchanged unless `l11` equals `l22`, `p1` and `p2` are updated based on the conditions inside the loop, `a1` and `a2` are unchanged, `l1` and `l2` are unchanged, `l11` and `l22` are unchanged, `idx1` and `idx2` are set to `i` if the matching condition is met, otherwise `-1`, `i` is `n-2` if the loop completes all iterations.**

In simpler terms, the loop runs until it either finds matching pairs, reaches the maximum allowed iterations, or meets another break condition. The variables `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, and `idx2` are updated based on the loop's logic, while others remain unchanged.
