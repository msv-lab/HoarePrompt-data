The code snippet creates a new list `l11` by filtering out elements from `l1` that are equal to `a2`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, and `l2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **The loop completes all iterations and prints 'yes'. `t` is incremented by 1. `n` remains the first integer from the input. `m` remains the second integer from the input. `a1` is the first integer from the new input. `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input. `a2` is the first integer from the latest input. `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input. `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding those equal to `a2`.**
