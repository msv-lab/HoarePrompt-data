The code snippet assigns `-1` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the first integer from the input, `m` remains the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding those equal to `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1`.**
