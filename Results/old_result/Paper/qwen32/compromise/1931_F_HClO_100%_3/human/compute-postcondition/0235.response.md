The given code appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. This operation modifies the list `val` by adding a new element to it, which consists of the integer `a3` and the list `l3`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` is incremented by 1 (remains as per the precondition).
- `n` remains the first integer from the input (unchanged).
- `m` must be greater than 2 (unchanged).
- `a1` is the first integer from the new input (unchanged).
- `a2` is the first integer from the latest input (unchanged).
- `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding those equal to `a2` (unchanged).
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding those equal to `a1` (unchanged).
- `a3` is the first integer from the latest input (unchanged).
- `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input (unchanged).
- `idx1` remains -1 or is set to `n - 2` based on the condition (unchanged).
- `idx2` remains unchanged or is set to `n - 2` based on the condition (unchanged).
- `p1` is 0 (unchanged).
- `p2` is 0 (unchanged).
- `l1` and `l2` and `l` are defined based on the conditions involving `idx1`, `idx2`, `a1`, `a2`, and `l3` (unchanged).
- `val` now includes the new tuple `(a3, l3)`.

Output State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the first integer from the input, `m` must be greater than 2, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding those equal to `a1`, `a3` is the first integer from the latest input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `idx1` remains -1 or is set to `n - 2` based on the condition, `idx2` remains unchanged or is set to `n - 2` based on the condition, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `l1` and `l2` and `l` are defined based on the conditions involving `idx1`, `idx2`, `a1`, `a2`, and `l3`, `val` includes the new tuple `(a3, l3)`.**
