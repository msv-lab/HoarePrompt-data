The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `m - 2` times. Since `m` is given as 5, the loop will execute `5 - 2 = 3` times.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have completed one of its iterations. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that it reflects the beginning of the next iteration.

Let's break down the steps:

1. The loop iterates `m - 2` times, which means it will run 3 times in total.
2. After each iteration, the loop variable `_` is incremented by 1.
3. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` would have taken on the value of the number of completed iterations (0-indexed).

Given that the loop has just finished an iteration, the value of `_` would have been 0, 1, or 2 during the previous iterations. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` should be set to the next value in the sequence, which is 1, 2, or 3 respectively.

Since we are asked to provide the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `_` by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

If we assume the loop has just finished its first iteration (`_` was 0), then at the start of the next iteration, `_` should be 1. Similarly, if the loop has just finished its second iteration (`_` was 1), then at the start of the next iteration, `_` should be 2.

However, since we don't know exactly which iteration just finished, we can generalize that `_` should be incremented by 1 from its current value. Given that the loop runs 3 times in total, the possible values for `_` at the start of the next iteration are 1, 2, or 3.

For the sake of providing a concrete answer, let's assume the loop has just finished its first iteration, so `_` should be 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is 5, `n` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `idx1` is either `n - 2` or -1, `idx2` is not -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first integer from the new input line, `l3` is a list of integers from the new input line excluding the first integer, `_` is 1**
