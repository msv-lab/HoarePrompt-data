The given code snippet appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. This means that the list `val` will now include an additional element, which is the tuple consisting of `a3` and `l3`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the first integer from the input, `m` must be greater than 2, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding those equal to `a1`, `a3` is the first integer from the latest input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `idx1` remains -1 or is set to `n - 2` based on the condition, `idx2` remains unchanged or is set to `n - 2` based on the condition, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `l1` and `l2` and `l` are defined based on the conditions involving `idx1`, `idx2`, `a1`, `a2`, and `l3`, `val` includes the new tuple `(a3, l3)`**

In simpler terms, the only change is that `val` now contains an additional tuple `(a3, l3)`. All other variables retain their previous values and states.
