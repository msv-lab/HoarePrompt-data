The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state mentioned does not specify the values of `n` and `m` before this assignment, so we only know their values after the input operation. The values of `t` and the loop condition remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **the loop completes all iterations and prints 'yes', `t` is incremented by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input**.
