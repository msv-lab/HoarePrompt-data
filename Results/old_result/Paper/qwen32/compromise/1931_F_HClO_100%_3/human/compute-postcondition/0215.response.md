The code snippet assigns the list `l1` to the variable `l`. This means that `l` now holds the same list as `l1`, which includes the elements from the new input with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`.

Given the initial state, the values of `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `val` remain unchanged. Only the variable `l` is updated.

Output State: **t is incremented by 1, n remains the first integer from the input, m remains the second integer from the input, a1 is the first integer from the new input, l1 is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, a2 is the first integer from the latest input, l2 is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, l11 is a list containing elements from l1 excluding those equal to a2, l22 is a list containing elements from l2 excluding those equal to a1, if `idx2 == -1 and idx1 != -1`, then `idx1` is set to `n - 2` and `idx2` is set to `n - 2`. Otherwise, `idx1` remains -1 and `idx2` remains unchanged. Additionally, `idx1` is not less than `idx2` and `idx1 > idx2`. p1 is 0, p2 is 0, val is an empty list, l is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`.**
