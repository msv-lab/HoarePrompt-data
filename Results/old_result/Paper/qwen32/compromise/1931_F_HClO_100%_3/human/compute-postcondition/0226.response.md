The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value of `a2` into the list `l2` at the position specified by `idx1`. This means that the element currently at `idx1` and all subsequent elements in `l2` will be shifted one position to the right.

Given the initial state, `idx1` could be `-1` or `n - 2` depending on the conditions involving `m`, `idx2`, and `idx1`. However, since `idx1` is not less than `idx2` and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, the only feasible value for `idx1` under these constraints is `n - 2`.

Thus, `a2` is inserted into `l2` at position `n - 2`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the first integer from the input, `m` remains the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list containing elements from the latest input with `a2` inserted at position `n - 2`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding those equal to `a1`. If `m == 2` and `idx2 == -1` and `idx1 != -1`, then `idx1` is set to `n - 2` and `idx2` is set to `n - 2`. Otherwise, `idx1` remains -1 and `idx2` remains unchanged. Additionally, `idx1` is not less than `idx2`. `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is an empty list. Furthermore, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`. `a3` is the first integer from the latest input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input. The index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`.**
