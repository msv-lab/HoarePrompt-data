Given the initial state, let's break down the information:

- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- `t` is incremented by 1 compared to its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `val` contains `m - 2` tuples `(a3, l3)`.
- `p1` is 0.
- `p2` is 0.
- The loop prints 'yes'.

The `print('yes')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any specific variable or calculation described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'yes'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **yes**
