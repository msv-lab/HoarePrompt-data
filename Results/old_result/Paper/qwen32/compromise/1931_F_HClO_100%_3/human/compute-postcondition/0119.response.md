Output State: **`val` is a list containing at least one tuple, specifically `[(a3, l3), (a3, l3), (a3, l3)]`. The current value of `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of `val` and `l3` remain unchanged. The code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement without altering any variables.
