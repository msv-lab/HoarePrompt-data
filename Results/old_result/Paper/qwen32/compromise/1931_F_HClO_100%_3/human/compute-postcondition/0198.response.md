Postcondition: **`t` is incremented by 1, `n` must be at least 3, `m` remains the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding those equal to `a1`, `i` is 3, `idx1` is 3 if `l1[i + p1] == a2` otherwise `idx2` is 3, `p1` is 1 if `l1[i + p1] == a2` otherwise `p2` is 1. If `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no further changes are made to `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, or `p2`.**
