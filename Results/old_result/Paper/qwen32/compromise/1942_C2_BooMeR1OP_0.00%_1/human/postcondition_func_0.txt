The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the arrangement of the chosen vertices and the additional constraint `y`. The printed value represents a computed sum related to the gaps between the chosen vertices and the constraint `y`.
