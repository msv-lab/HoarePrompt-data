Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5); `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; `a` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to `n-1` sorted in ascending order.**

In simple terms, the list `a` has been sorted in ascending order, while all other variables remain unchanged.
