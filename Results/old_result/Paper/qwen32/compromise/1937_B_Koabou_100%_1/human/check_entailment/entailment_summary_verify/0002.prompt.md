You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is

- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. For each test case, it processes the binary strings and prints a modified binary string `s` and an integer `t`. The modified binary string `s` is derived based on specific conditions involving transitions between '0' and '1' in the input strings, and `t` is determined by the length of a matching substring.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by a grasshopper moving from the top-left cell (1, 1) to the bottom-right cell (2, n) in a 2 x n grid, and also count the number of paths that yield this string.

### Key Points:
1. **Movement:** The grasshopper can only move right or downwards.
2. **Lexicographically Smallest String:** This means the string formed by the path should be the smallest possible when compared lexicographically.
3. **Count Paths:** We need to count how many different paths can produce this smallest string.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program does not seem to correctly address the problem requirements. Let's break down the issues:
1. **Path Selection Logic:**
   - The program attempts to find a point `x` where it switches from the top row to the bottom row, and a point `y` where it could switch if the top row has a '0' and the bottom row has a '1' at that point.
   - However, this logic does not guarantee that the resulting string `s` will be the lexicographically smallest possible string.
   
2. **String Construction:**
   - The string `s` is constructed based on the first occurrence where the top row has a '1' and the bottom row has a '0'. This is not a general approach to finding the lexicographically smallest string.

3. **Path Counting:**
   - The program counts the number of paths based on a condition that does not necessarily reflect the number of ways to form the smallest string.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem:
1. **Dynamic Programming:** Use dynamic programming to find the lexicographically smallest string and the number of ways to achieve it.
2. **Path Tracking:** Track the paths that lead to the smallest string by maintaining a count of paths that form the same string up to each cell.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It fails to guarantee the lexicographically smallest string and does not correctly count the number of paths that yield this string.

**Correctness:** **False**
