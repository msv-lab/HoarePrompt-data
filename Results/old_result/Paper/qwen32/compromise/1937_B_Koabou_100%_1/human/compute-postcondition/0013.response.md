Given the initial state, the variables and their values are:

- `a` is a list containing the strings '1101' and '0110'.
- `n` is unchanged (its value is not specified, but it is not used in the print statement).
- `s` is the string '1110'.
- `x` is 0.
- `y` is 0.
- `t` is 1.

The `print` statement is:

```python
print(t)
```

Since `t` is explicitly given the value 1, the print statement will output the value of `t`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **1**
