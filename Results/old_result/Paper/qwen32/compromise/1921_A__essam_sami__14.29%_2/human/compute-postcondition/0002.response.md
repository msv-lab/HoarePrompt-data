To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, we need to understand what the loop does in each iteration and how the variables evolve.

In each iteration of the loop:
1. Four pairs of integers `(a, b)`, `(c, d)`, `(e, f)`, and `(g, h)` are read from the input.
2. Two variables `n` and `x` are calculated based on the Euclidean distance squared between the points `(a, b)` and `(e, f)`, and `(c, d)` and `(g, h)` respectively.
3. The loop then prints the smaller of the two calculated values `n` and `x`.

The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the initial integer input. After all iterations, the loop will have printed `t` values, each being the smaller of the two calculated distances squared for each respective iteration.

Since the loop does not modify any variables outside of its local scope in each iteration, and it only prints values, the state of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, `n`, and `x` at the end of the loop will not persist. The only thing that remains is the output, which is `t` printed values.

Output State: **The loop will have printed `t` lines, each line containing the smaller of the two calculated squared distances for each iteration.**
