The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. The initial state only mentions `t` as an input integer, which is not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, `x` are integers obtained from the input.**
