The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` subtracts twice the value of the element at index `i + x` in the array `a` from `ans1`.

Output State: **`ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[i]` minus twice `a[i + x]`; `ans2` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`; `ans` is the maximum value between the updated `ans1` and `ans2`; `n` and `a` are integers read from the input with `a` sorted in descending order; `k` must be greater than 0; `i + x` is less than `n`.**

In simpler terms: `ans1` has been updated to reflect the subtraction of twice the element at index `i + x` from its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
