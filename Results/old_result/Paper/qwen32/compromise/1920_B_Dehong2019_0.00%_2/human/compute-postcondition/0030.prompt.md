Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k` are integers obtained from the input, `x` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order obtained from the input, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    ans1 += a[i]
    if i + x < n:
        ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
    ans = max(ans1, ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k` are integers where `k` is greater than 0 and `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order. If `i + x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[i]` minus `a[i + x] * 2`. Otherwise, `ans1` remains unchanged. `ans2` retains its initial value throughout. `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k` are integers where `k` is greater than 0 and `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order. If `i + x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is updated to the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[i]` minus `a[i + x] * 2`. Otherwise, `ans1` is updated to its current value plus `a[i]`. `ans2` retains its initial value. `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`. `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `ans` is updated to `max(ans1, ans2)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k` are integers where `k` is greater than 0 and `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is updated to `ans1 + a[i]`, `ans2` retains its initial value, `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is further updated to `ans1 - a[i + x] * 2`. `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
