Output State: **`ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a`; `ans2` retains its initial value; `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`; `n`, `k`, and `x` are the integers read from the input; `a` is sorted in descending order.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `ans1` is now the sum of all elements in the list `a`. The values of `ans2`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and the sorted order of `a` remain unchanged.
