The code snippet `ans1 += a[i]` increments the value of `ans1` by the value of the element at index `i` in the list `a`. 

Given the initial state, `ans1` is initially the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`. After executing the code, `ans1` will be this initial value plus `a[i]`.

The values of `ans2` and `ans` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the operation on `ans1`. The variables `n`, `a`, and `k` also remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[i]`; `ans2` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`; `ans` is the maximum value between the updated `ans1` and `ans2`; `n` and `a` are integers read from the input with `a` sorted in descending order; `k` must be greater than 0.**
