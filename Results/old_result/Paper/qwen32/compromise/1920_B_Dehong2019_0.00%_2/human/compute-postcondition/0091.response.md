Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **List `a`**: It is sorted in descending order.
2. **`ans1` Calculation**:
   - Start with the sum of all elements in `a`.
   - Subtract twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` (i.e., `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`).
   - Add the sum of the first `k` elements of `a`.
   - Subtract twice `a[i + x]` for each `i` where `i + x < n`.

3. **`ans2`**: It is equal to `ans1`.
4. **`ans`**: It is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`, which, in this case, is `ans1` itself.
5. **`t`**: It is decremented by 1, but this does not affect the value of `ans`.
6. **`n`, `k`, and `x`**: These remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Explanation of `ans`:
- `ans1` is calculated based on the specific formula involving the elements of the sorted list `a`, the variables `k`, `x`, and `n`.
- `ans2` is set to be equal to `ans1`.
- `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, which simplifies to `ans1` in this case.

Since the exact values of `a`, `k`, `x`, and `n` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans1` and, consequently, `ans`. However, we can describe `ans` in terms of the given formula and variables.

### Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum value between ans1 and ans2, which is ans1 itself, calculated as the sum of all elements in a minus 2 times the sum of the first x elements of a plus the sum of the first k elements of a minus 2 times a[i + x] for each i where i + x < n)**
