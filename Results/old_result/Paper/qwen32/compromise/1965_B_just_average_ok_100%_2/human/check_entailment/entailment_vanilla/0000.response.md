Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
  - There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
  - For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Initialization of `nums`:**
   ```python
   nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]
   ```
   This creates a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\). These values are `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 1048576]`.

2. **Finding the appropriate index:**
   ```python
   idx = -1
   for i in range(len(nums)):
       if nums[i] > k:
           idx = i - 1
           break
   ```
   This loop finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to 1, `idx` will remain -1, but this scenario is not possible because `k` is at least 1.

3. **Modifying the list `nums`:**
   ```python
   nums.append(k - nums[idx])
   nums.append(k + 1)
   nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
   nums.remove(1 << idx)
   ```
   - `nums.append(k - nums[idx])`: Adds a value that, when combined with `nums[idx]`, sums to `k`. This ensures that no subsequence of `nums` sums to `k`.
   - `nums.append(k + 1)`: Adds a value greater than `k` to ensure it doesn't contribute to a sum of `k`.
   - `nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)`: Adds another value greater than `k` to further ensure no subsequence sums to `k`.
   - `nums.remove(1 << idx)`: Removes the power of 2 that was used to calculate `k - nums[idx]`.

4. **Output:**
   ```python
   print(len(nums))
   print(*nums)
   ```
   Prints the length of the modified list and the elements of the list.

### Verification:

- **Subsequences Summing to Values Other Than `k`:**
  - The initial list of powers of 2 allows for the formation of any sum from 1 to \(2^{21} - 1\) through subsequences.
  - By removing one power of 2 and adding specific values, the program ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while still allowing sums to all other values up to `n`.

- **Size Constraint:**
  - The list `nums` initially has 21 elements. After modifications, it has 24 elements (removing one and adding three), which is well within the limit of 25.

### Conclusion:
The program constructs a sequence that meets the criteria specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
