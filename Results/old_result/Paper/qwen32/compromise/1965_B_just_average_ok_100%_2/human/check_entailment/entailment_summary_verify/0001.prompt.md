You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]
        idx = -1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it constructs a list of numbers starting with powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\), modifies this list based on the value of `k`, and then prints the length of the modified list followed by its elements.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
- We need to find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
- There must be no subsequence of `a` that sums to `k`.
- For every integer `v` (where `1 ≤ v ≤ n` and `v ≠ k`), there must be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

### Analysis of the Given Program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Generating Initial Sequence**:
   - It initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\). This list represents the binary representation of numbers, which is useful because every number can be represented uniquely as a sum of distinct powers of 2.

3. **Finding the Largest Power of 2 Less Than `k`**:
   - It iterates through the list `nums` to find the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`. This is stored in `idx`.

4. **Modifying the Sequence**:
   - It appends three new numbers to `nums`:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This ensures that the sum `k` cannot be formed using the existing elements in `nums`.
     - `k + 1`: This ensures that `k + 1` can be formed.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This ensures that another number greater than `k` can be formed.
   - It removes the element `1 << idx` from `nums` to avoid forming the sum `k`.

5. **Output**:
   - It prints the length of the modified `nums` list.
   - It prints the elements of the modified `nums` list.

### Evaluation:

- **Subsequences Summing to `v` (where `1 ≤ v ≤ n` and `v ≠ k`)**:
  - The initial sequence of powers of 2 allows forming any sum up to \(2^{21} - 1\) (which is much larger than `n`).
  - By removing `1 << idx` and adding `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, the program ensures that `k` cannot be formed, but other sums remain possible.

- **Size Constraint**:
  - The initial sequence has 21 elements.
  - After modifications, it adds 3 more elements and removes 1, resulting in a maximum of 23 elements, which satisfies the constraint of having a sequence of size at most 25.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly generate a sequence that meets the problem's requirements for each test case.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
