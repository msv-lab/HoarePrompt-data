To determine the output of the `print(*nums)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and how the list `nums` is constructed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variables:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 1000 (not directly used in the construction of `nums`).
   - `n` and `k`: Integers read from the input.
   - `nums`: A list constructed based on specific rules involving powers of 2 and the value of `k`.

2. **Construction of `nums`:**
   - The list `nums` initially contains the following elements: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`.
   - Additionally, it includes two more elements: `k - nums[idx]` and `k + 1`.
   - It also includes `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - The element `1 << idx` (which is equivalent to \(2^{idx}\)) is removed from the list.
   - `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if `k` is less than 1.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine `idx`:**
   - `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - If `k` is less than 1, `idx` is -1.

2. **Construct the List `nums`:**
   - Start with the predefined list of powers of 2.
   - Add `k - nums[idx]` and `k + 1` to the list.
   - Add `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the list.
   - Remove the element `1 << idx` from the list.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(*nums)` statement will print all elements of the list `nums` separated by spaces.

### Example Calculation:

Let's consider an example where `k = 10`:

- The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 10 is 8, which is at index 3 in the predefined list.
- So, `idx = 3`.
- The element `1 << idx` is `1 << 3` which is 8.
- We add `k - nums[idx]` which is `10 - 8 = 2`.
- We add `k + 1` which is `10 + 1 = 11`.
- We add `k + nums[idx] + 1` which is `10 + 8 + 1 = 19`.
- We remove the element `8` from the list.

Thus, the final list `nums` would be:
\[ [1, 2, 4, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2, 11, 19] \]

### General Output Description:

Given the above analysis, the output will be the elements of the list `nums` after the specified modifications, separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 4 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 [k - nums[idx]] k+1 [k + nums[idx] + 1] (where idx is the index of the largest power of 2 in nums that is less than or equal to k, or -1 if k is less than 1)**

However, since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we cannot specify the exact numerical values of `[k - nums[idx]]` and `[k + nums[idx] + 1]`. Therefore, we describe them in terms of `k` and `idx`.

Output: **1 2 4 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 [k - nums[idx]] k+1 [k + nums[idx] + 1] (where idx is the index of the largest power of 2 in nums that is less than or equal to k, or -1 if k is less than 1)**
