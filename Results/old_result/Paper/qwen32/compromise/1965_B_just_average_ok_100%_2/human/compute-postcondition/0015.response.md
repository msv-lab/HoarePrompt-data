Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]; `i` is 2; `idx` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, or `i`. The value of `idx` remains 1 because the condition `if nums[i] > k` was not met (or evaluated), and thus `idx` was not updated to -2.
