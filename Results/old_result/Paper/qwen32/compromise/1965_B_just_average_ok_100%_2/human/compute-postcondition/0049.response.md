The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means that the values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the input provided, while the other variables (`t`, `nums`, `idx`) remain unchanged unless they are explicitly modified later in the code.

Given the initial state, the only changes occur to `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, `k + nums[idx] + 1`] with the element `1 << idx` removed; `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if `k` is less than 1**
In natural language: The values of `n` and `k` are now set to the integers read from the input, while the other variables remain unchanged.
