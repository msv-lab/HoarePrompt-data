The code assigns the value of `i - 1` to `idx`. Given that `i` is 1, `idx` will be `1 - 1`, which equals 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `idx` is 0, `i` is 1**
