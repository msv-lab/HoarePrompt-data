Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]. If `nums[i]` is greater than `k`, the loop or if statement breaks. Otherwise, `idx` is the index of the largest element in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`.**
