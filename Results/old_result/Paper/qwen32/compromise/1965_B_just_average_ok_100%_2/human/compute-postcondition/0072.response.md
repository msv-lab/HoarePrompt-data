Output State: **After all iterations, the loop will have processed `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads integers `n` and `k`. It constructs a list `nums` initially containing powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\). It then finds the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k` (or sets `idx` to -1 if `k` is greater than \(2^{20}\)). It modifies `nums` by removing this power of 2 and appending three new elements: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`. Finally, it prints the length of the modified `nums` list followed by its elements. This process repeats for all `t` test cases.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the program will have handled `t` different scenarios where for each scenario, it processes two numbers `n` and `k`, adjusts a predefined list of powers of 2 based on `k`, and outputs the modified list's length and contents.
