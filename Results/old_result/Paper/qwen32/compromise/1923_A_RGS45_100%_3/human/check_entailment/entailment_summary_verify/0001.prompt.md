You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string of `n` characters (each being either '0' or '1' with at least one '1' present). For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of '0's between the first and last '1' in the string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and compare it to the problem description to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Breakdown:
The goal is to move the chips so that they form a contiguous block, with the minimum number of operations. An operation involves moving a chip to the closest free cell to its left.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the configuration of chips/free cells `arr`.

2. **Finding Chip Positions:**
   - `x = arr.find('1')`: This finds the index of the first chip from the left.
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')`: This finds the index of the first chip from the right. Since it's a reversed string, this effectively finds the index of the last chip from the left.

3. **Calculating the Minimum Moves:**
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]`: This creates a substring from the first chip to the last chip.
   - `print(z.count('0'))`: This counts the number of free cells in the substring between the first and last chip.

### Reasoning:
The logic in the program is flawed. It does not correctly calculate the minimum number of moves required. The number of moves required is not simply the number of free cells between the first and last chip. 

For example, consider the input `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`. The first chip is at index 1, and the last chip is at index 6. The substring `arr[1:9-0]` is `1 1 0 0 0 1 1`, which has 3 free cells. However, the correct answer is 3 because you need to move the chips at positions 5 and 6 to the left, but the chip at position 2 does not need to move.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
1. Identify the positions of all chips.
2. Calculate the minimum number of moves required to bring all chips together. This can be done by calculating the cost of moving each chip to the median position of all chips.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to form a contiguous block of chips. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
