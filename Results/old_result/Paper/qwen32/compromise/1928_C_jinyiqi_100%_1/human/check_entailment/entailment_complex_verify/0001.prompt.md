You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)

            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))

    return output2 + output1



- Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incorrectly defined based on the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(n, x):` where `n` and `x` are integers such that `1 <= x < n <= 10^9`.
def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
        
    #State: output1 = [1, 2, 3], output2 = [12, 6, 4]
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
    #The program returns [12, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer parameter `x` and returns a list of integers consisting of the divisors of `x` in descending order, followed by the divisors in ascending order.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves finding the number of possible values of `k` such that in a sequence where positions are assigned in a repeating pattern, a given position `n` is assigned the number `x`. The pattern is:
- First `k` positions: 1, 2, ..., k
- Next `k-2` positions: k-1, k-2, ..., 2
- This pattern repeats every `2k-2` positions.

### Key Observations

1. **Pattern Length**: The pattern repeats every `2k-2` positions.
2. **Position Assignment**: For a given `k`, the position `n` can be mapped to a number `x` within the repeating pattern.
3. **Constraints**: `k > 1` and `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.

2. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The program checks if `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0`.
   - These conditions are used to determine potential values of `k`.

3. **Finding Divisors**:
   - The function `func_1(x)` finds all divisors of `x`.
   - The divisors are used to determine possible values of `k`.

4. **Generating Possible `k` Values**:
   - For each divisor `s` of `n + x - 2` and `n - x`, it checks if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, `(s + 2) / 2` is added to the list of possible `k` values.

5. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the number of unique possible `k` values.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return divisors of `x`, but it returns them in a specific order that is not necessary for the problem.
   - The function should return divisors of `x`, but the order of divisors does not affect the correctness of the solution.

2. **Logic for Determining `k`**:
   - The program uses the conditions `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` to determine potential values of `k`.
   - It then checks if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` for each divisor `s`.
   - These conditions are derived from the pattern and the problem constraints, but the implementation seems correct.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the constraint `k > 1` by ensuring `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic and implementation are correct. The program correctly determines the number of possible values of `k` that fit the given constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
