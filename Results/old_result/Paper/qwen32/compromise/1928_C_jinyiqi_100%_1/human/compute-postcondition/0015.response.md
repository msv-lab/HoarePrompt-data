To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop and its behavior.

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = int(x ** 0.5)`. For each `i`, it checks if `x` is divisible by `i`. If it is, both `i` and `x // i` are appended to `output1` and `output2`, respectively.

Given the initial state and the outputs after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that `x` must be a number that has at least 3 divisors including 1 and `x` itself. The third divisor could be any integer `i` such that `1 < i < x` and `x % i == 0`.

Let's consider an example where `x` is 12. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. The loop will iterate from `i = 1` to `i = int(12 ** 0.5) = 3`.

- **Iteration 1 (i = 1)**: `12 % 1 == 0`, so `output1` becomes `[1]` and `output2` becomes `[12]`.
- **Iteration 2 (i = 2)**: `12 % 2 == 0`, so `output1` becomes `[1, 2]` and `output2` becomes `[12, 6]`.
- **Iteration 3 (i = 3)**: `12 % 3 == 0`, so `output1` becomes `[1, 2, 3]` and `output2` becomes `[12, 6, 4]`.

The loop stops here because `i` would next be 4, which is greater than `int(12 ** 0.5) = 3`.

Thus, the final state of `output1` and `output2` after all iterations would be `[1, 2, 3]` and `[12, 6, 4]`, respectively.

Output State: **output1 = [1, 2, 3], output2 = [12, 6, 4]**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output2` contains the corresponding quotients of `x` divided by these divisors. For `x = 12`, `output1` is `[1, 2, 3]` and `output2` is `[12, 6, 4]`.
