The code appends the value of `i` to the list `output1`. Given that `i` is 2, `output1` initially contains the element 1, and `output2` contains the element `x`, the new state of `output1` will be `[1, 2]`. The values of `i`, `x`, and `output2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is at least 4, `output1` contains the elements [1, 2], and `output2` contains the element `x`.**
