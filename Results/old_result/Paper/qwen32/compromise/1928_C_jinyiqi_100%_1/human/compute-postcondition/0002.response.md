To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which includes the variables `i` and the range parameters `1` and `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

The loop will execute if the range has at least one value, meaning `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than `1`. This implies that `int(x ** 0.5)` must be at least `1`, which means `x ** 0.5` must be at least `1`. Therefore, `x` must be at least `1`.

Given the constraints `1 <= x < n <= 10^9`, `x` is already guaranteed to be at least `1`. However, we need to ensure that the loop starts with `i` set to its initial value, which is `1` according to the range.

The states `output1` and `output2` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `x` is at least `1` and `i` is set to `1` at the start of the loop.

State: **`func_1` is correctly defined as `def func_1(n, x):` where `1 <= x < n <= 10^9`, `output1` is an empty list, `output2` is an empty list, `i` is 1, and `x` is at least 1**. 

However, since `x` is already guaranteed to be at least `1` by the problem constraints, the final state focusing only on the loop head is:

State: **`i` is 1, `x` is at least 1**.
