Reasoning: Let's go through the program and the annotations to ensure that the logic is correct and matches the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts given two pricing options:
1. Buying one yogurt for `a` burles.
2. Buying two yogurts for `b` burles.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates the cost of buying `n` yogurts in two ways:
1. `ans1`: Cost if all yogurts are bought individually (`a * n`).
2. `ans2`: Cost if yogurts are bought in pairs as much as possible, with any remaining yogurt bought individually (`b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`).

The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

### Annotations Analysis
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- Before the function call, `t` is the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers within the given constraints.
- Inside the loop, `n`, `a`, and `b` are read for each test case.
- The logic correctly calculates `ans1` and `ans2` and prints the minimum cost.

### Example Verification
Let's verify the example cases provided in the problem description:

1. **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
   - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
   - Minimum cost is 9, which matches the expected output.

2. **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
   - Minimum cost is 14, which matches the expected output.

3. **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
   - Minimum cost is 15, which matches the expected output.

4. **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
   - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
   - Minimum cost is 20, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion
The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case based on the provided logic and the example verification confirms its correctness.

Final: **True**
