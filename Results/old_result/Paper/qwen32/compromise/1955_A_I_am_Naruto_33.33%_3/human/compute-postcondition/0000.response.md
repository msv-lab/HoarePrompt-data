In the provided task, the for loop iterates based on the input value `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head contains only the underscore `_` and `int(input())`. This means that the only state we can adjust to ensure the loop executes is the value of `t`.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the integer input.
2. The loop head does not contain any variables that we can directly adjust within the state (since `_` is a throwaway variable and `int(input())` is reading from input).
3. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `t` is set to a value that is at least 1, as the loop will not execute if `t` is 0.

Given the constraints `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, we can confirm that `t` is already within the range that ensures the loop will execute at least once. However, to adhere to the task's requirement of adjusting the state for the loop to execute, we can explicitly state that `t` should be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
