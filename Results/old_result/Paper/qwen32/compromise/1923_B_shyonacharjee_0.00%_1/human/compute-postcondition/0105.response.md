Output State: **`t` is at least 1 and has been decremented by `n` + 1; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is a new input integer; `healths` is a list of integers read from the input; `positions` is a list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple contains a position and a health value, sorted by the absolute value of the position; `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used` + `bullets_needed`; `i` is incremented by 1; `position` is the position value of the `i`-th monster in `monsters`; `health` is the health value of the `i`-th monster in `monsters`; `distance` is the absolute value of `position`; `time_available` is the absolute value of `position`; `bullets_needed` is `health`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` has been decremented by `n` + 1 and is still at least 1; `n` remains greater than 0; `k` is a new input integer; `healths` and `positions` remain as lists of integers read from the input; `monsters` remains a sorted list of tuples by the absolute value of the position; `total_bullets_used` is updated to its previous value plus the `health` of the current monster; `i` is incremented by 1; `position` and `health` are updated to the position and health of the `i`-th monster in `monsters`; `distance` and `time_available` remain as the absolute value of `position`; `bullets_needed` is set to the `health` of the current monster.
