Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `k` is an integer from the input, `healths` is a list of integers from the new input, `positions` is a list of integers from the new input, `monsters` is a sorted list of (position, health) tuples based on the absolute value of positions, `total_bullets_used` is `health + bullets_needed`, `position` is the position value from the `i`-th tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the health value from the `i`-th tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is `abs(position)`, `time_available` is `abs(position)`, `bullets_needed` is `health`, `i` is `i + 1`, `success` is False**
The variable `success` has been assigned the value `False`. All other variables retain their initial values as per the given initial state.
