Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1 and is decremented by 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is an integer from the input; `healths` is a list of integers from the new input; `positions` is a list of integers from the new input; `monsters` is a sorted list of (position, health) tuples based on the absolute value of positions; `total_bullets_used` is `health`; `position` is the position value from the `i`-th tuple in `monsters`; `health` is the health value from the `i`-th tuple in `monsters`; `distance` is `abs(position)`; `time_available` is `abs(position)`; `bullets_needed` is `health`; `i` is incremented by 1. If `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, `success` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `success` remains True.**
