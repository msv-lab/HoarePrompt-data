Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is an integer from the input; `healths` and `positions` are lists from the input; `monsters` is a sorted list of (position, health) tuples based on the absolute value of positions; `position` and `health` are the `i`-th tuple values from `monsters`; `distance` is the absolute value of `position`; `time_available` is the absolute value of `position`; `bullets_needed` is `health`. If `total_bullets_used` plus `bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, `success` is set to False and the loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `total_bullets_used` is updated by adding `bullets_needed`.**
