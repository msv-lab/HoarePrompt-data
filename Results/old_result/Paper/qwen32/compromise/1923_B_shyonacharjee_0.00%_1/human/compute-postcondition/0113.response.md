Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a list `x` of `n` integers. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. Specifically, if `x` is a list of `n` integers such that `-n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n` and `x_i ≠ 0` for each `i`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`, the function computes and returns a value based on these inputs. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
