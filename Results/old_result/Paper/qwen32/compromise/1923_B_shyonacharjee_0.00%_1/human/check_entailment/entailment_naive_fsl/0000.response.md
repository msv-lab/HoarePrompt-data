Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle the problem description in all cases. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that the player can shoot multiple bullets in a single second, and these bullets can be directed at different monsters. The program only checks if the total bullets used up to a certain monster exceed the time available for that monster, but it does not consider the possibility of shooting multiple monsters in the same second.

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
3 2
1 2 3
-1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation:**
- During the 1st second, you can fire 1 bullet at the 1st monster and 1 bullet at the 3rd monster. The 1st monster dies, and the 2nd and 3rd monsters move closer.
- During the 2nd second, you can fire 2 bullets at the 2nd monster. The 2nd monster dies, and the 3rd monster moves closer.
- During the 3rd second, you can fire 2 bullets at the 3rd monster. The 3rd monster dies.

However, the program will fail for this case because it does not correctly account for the ability to shoot multiple monsters in the same second. The program will incorrectly determine that it is not possible to kill the monsters in time.

To fix this, the program should consider the total number of bullets available per second and distribute them optimally among the monsters that are closest and need to be killed first. The current implementation does not do this and only checks the cumulative bullets used against the time available for each monster individually, which is not the correct approach.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
2 2
1 1
-1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Program Output:**
```
NO
```

In this case, the player can shoot one bullet at each monster in the first second, killing both before they move closer. However, the program will incorrectly conclude that it is not possible to kill both monsters in time because it does not account for the ability to shoot multiple monsters in the same second.
