### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step to confirm its accuracy:

1. **Function Summary Misalignment**:
   - The function summary provided states that `func_1` always returns the tuple `(0, 0)`, which is incorrect based on the code. The function does not explicitly return anything, and its behavior is to modify the `sequence` list in place and make recursive calls.

2. **Logic and Correctness of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to generate a sequence based on the number of increasing subsequences required, but its logic is flawed:
     - It calculates `size` and `value` based on the number of subsequences, but the way it does this does not guarantee that the final sequence will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
     - The recursive call and the way it modifies the sequence do not align with the problem's requirements.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle cases where it is impossible to construct an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. It should return `-1` in such cases, but the current implementation does not do this.

4. **Output Requirements**:
   - The program needs to output `-1` if it's impossible to find the required array, or the length and the array itself if it's possible. The current implementation does not meet these requirements.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the program is incorrect. The function `func_1` does not correctly generate the sequence to meet the problem's requirements, and the program does not handle cases where it's impossible to construct such an array.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
