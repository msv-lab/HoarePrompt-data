Reasoning:  
The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Let's break down the problems:

1. **Function `func_1` is not defined properly**: The function `func_1` is supposed to generate a sequence of numbers that results in exactly `X` increasing subsequences. However, the provided implementation does not correctly generate such a sequence. The logic inside the function is not aligned with the requirements of the problem.

2. **Incorrect use of `sequence`**: The `sequence` parameter in `func_1` is intended to be modified in place to build the result array. However, the function is not correctly appending elements to `sequence` to ensure that the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.

3. **Incorrect handling of base case**: The base case in `func_1` returns `0, 0`, which does not make sense in the context of the problem. The function should handle the base case by returning an empty sequence or a sequence that results in exactly one increasing subsequence.

4. **Incorrect loop and condition logic**: The loop and condition logic inside `func_1` are not correctly implemented to find the appropriate size and overlap that would result in `X` increasing subsequences.

5. **Lack of handling for large `X`**: The problem specifies that `X` can be as large as `10^18`, which means the function needs to handle very large numbers efficiently. The current implementation does not appear to be capable of doing so.

Given these issues, the provided program is not correct for solving the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
