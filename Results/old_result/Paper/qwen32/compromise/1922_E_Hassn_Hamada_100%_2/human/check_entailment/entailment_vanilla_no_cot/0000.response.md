Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly generate an array with exactly X increasing subsequences. The function `func_1` is intended to build the sequence, but the logic for determining the sequence elements and the recursive calls does not align with the problem requirements.

The program seems to be trying to construct the sequence based on powers of 2, which is a common approach for problems involving subsequences, but the implementation details are incorrect. Specifically, the calculation of `size` and `value` and the recursive call to `func_1` do not ensure that the final sequence will have exactly X increasing subsequences.

Here are some specific issues:
1. The base case for the recursion is incorrect. It returns a tuple `(0, 0)` which is not used properly.
2. The calculation of `size` and `value` does not correctly determine the elements to be added to the sequence.
3. The recursive call to `func_1` does not correctly reduce the problem size in a way that guarantees the final sequence will have exactly X increasing subsequences.

A correct approach would involve a more systematic way to build the sequence, possibly using a combination of binary representation and careful selection of sequence elements to ensure the desired number of increasing subsequences.
