The code snippet provided increments the value of `size` by 1. The other variables (`value`, `sequence`, `i`, and `number`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `size` is `previous_i + 1`
- `value` is `(3/2) * 2^(previous_i)`
- `sequence` is unchanged
- `i` is `previous_i - 1`
- `number` must be at least `(7/2) * 2^(previous_i)`

After executing `size += 1`, the value of `size` becomes `previous_i + 2`.

Output State: **`size` is `previous_i + 2`, `value` is `(3/2) * 2^(previous_i)`, `sequence` is unchanged, `i` is `previous_i - 1`, `number` must be at least `(7/2) * 2^(previous_i)`**
