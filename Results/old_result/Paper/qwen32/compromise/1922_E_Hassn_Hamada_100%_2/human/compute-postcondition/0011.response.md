The code snippet `size += 1` increments the value of the variable `size` by 1. Given that the initial value of `size` is 2, after executing the code, the value of `size` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`number` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18), `size_overlap` is `(0, 0)`, `size` is 3, `i` is 1, `value` is 3**.
