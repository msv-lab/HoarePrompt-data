Postcondition: **`size` is `previous_i + n`, `value` is `2^(previous_i + n) - 2^(previous_i - 1)`, `sequence` is unchanged, `i` is `previous_i - 1`. If `value` is less than or equal to `number`, `size_overlap` is set to (`previous_i + n`, `previous_i - 1`) and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
