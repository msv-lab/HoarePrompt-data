Postcondition: **`number` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18), `size` is 10, `i` is 1, and `value` is 1022. If `value` is less than or equal to `number`, `size_overlap` is (10, 1) and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `size_overlap` remains (0, 0).**
