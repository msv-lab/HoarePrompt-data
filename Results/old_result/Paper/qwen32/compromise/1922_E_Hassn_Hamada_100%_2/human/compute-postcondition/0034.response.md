The code snippet provided is:
```python
size_overlap = size, i
```
This line of code creates a tuple `size_overlap` where the first element is the value of `size` and the second element is the value of `i`. The variables `size` and `i` are not modified by this line of code, and no other variables are affected.

Thus, the output state will include the new tuple `size_overlap` along with the existing conditions and values of `size` and `value`.

Output State: **`size` is the smallest integer such that (1 << (size + 1)) - 1 > number, `value` is (1 << size) - 1, `size_overlap` is a tuple (`size`, `i`)**.
