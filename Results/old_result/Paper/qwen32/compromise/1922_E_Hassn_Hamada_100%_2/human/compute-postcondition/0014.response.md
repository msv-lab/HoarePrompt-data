Output State: **`number` must be at least 14, `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18), `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `size` is 4, `i` is 1, `value` is 6**

In this output state, the value of `size` has been incremented by 1, changing from 3 to 4. All other variables retain their initial values.
