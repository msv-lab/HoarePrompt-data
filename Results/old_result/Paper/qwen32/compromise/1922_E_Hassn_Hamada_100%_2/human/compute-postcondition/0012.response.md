The code snippet `value = (1 << size) - (1 << i)` calculates the new value of `value` based on the current values of `size` and `i`. Given that `size` is 3 and `i` is 1, we can compute the new value of `value` as follows:

- `(1 << size)` shifts the number 1 to the left by `size` places, which is 3 places in this case. This results in `1 << 3` being `8` (binary `1000`).
- `(1 << i)` shifts the number 1 to the left by `i` places, which is 1 place in this case. This results in `1 << 1` being `2` (binary `10`).
- Subtracting these two values, we get `8 - 2`, which equals `6`.

Thus, the new value of `value` is 6. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`number` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18), `size_overlap` is `(0, 0)`, `size` is 3, `i` is 1, `value` is 6**.
