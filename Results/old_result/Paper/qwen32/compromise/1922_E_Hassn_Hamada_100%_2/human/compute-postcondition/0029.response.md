To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition:

```
while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as the expression `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)` is less than or equal to `number`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `size` is increased by 1
- `value` is `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`

We need to adjust the states of `size` and `i` in such a way that the loop condition holds true for the next iteration.

Let's break it down:

1. **Current State Analysis**:
    - `size` has been incremented by 1 from the previous iteration.
    - `value` is calculated as `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`.

2. **Next Iteration Condition**:
    - For the loop to continue, `(1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i)` must be less than or equal to `number`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
    - Since `size` has already been incremented by 1, we need to ensure that the new value of `(1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i)` is still less than or equal to `number`.
    - This means we might need to adjust `i` to ensure the condition holds true.

4. **Adjusting `i`**:
    - If `i` is too large, the term `(1 << i)` will be too large, making the condition `(1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) <= number` false.
    - Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is such that `(1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i)` remains less than or equal to `number`.

Since we don't have a specific value for `number`, we need to ensure that the expression `(1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i)` is still valid for the loop to continue. The simplest adjustment would be to ensure that `i` is not too large, which can be done by setting `i` to a smaller value or keeping it the same if it satisfies the condition.

**Final Adjusted State**:
- `size` is already incremented by 1.
- `i` should be adjusted to ensure that `(1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) <= number`.

Given the constraints and the need to ensure the loop condition holds, we can assume `i` should be adjusted to a value that keeps the condition true. Without a specific value for `number`, we can assume `i` should be less than or equal to `size` to ensure the condition holds.

State: **`size` is increased by 1, `i` must be such that `(1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) <= number`**
