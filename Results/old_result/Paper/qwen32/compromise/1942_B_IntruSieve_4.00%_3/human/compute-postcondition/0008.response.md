The provided loop iterates over each element in the list `mex` and prints it followed by a space. This loop does not modify the values of `mex`, `minn`, or `maxx`. It only prints the elements of `mex`. Therefore, the values of `minn` and `maxx` remain unchanged after the loop execution.

Output State: **mex is a list of n integers, minn is the final value after all increments, and maxx is the maximum value of abs(arr[i] - minn) encountered during the loop.**
