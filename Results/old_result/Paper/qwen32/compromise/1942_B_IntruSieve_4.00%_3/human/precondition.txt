The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the permutation p and the array a. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the elements of array a. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
