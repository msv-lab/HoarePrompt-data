Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a non-negative integer representing the current time step, `player` is a dictionary where keys are player identifiers (strings in the format "R0", "B0", ..., "R9", "B9") and values are lists of two integers representing the player's position on the field, `blud` is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field, `out` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for p in player:
    if player[p] == blud:
        out.append(p)
        player[p] = [-1, -1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a non-negative integer representing the current time step, `player` is a dictionary where `player[p]` is `[-1, -1]` if `player[p]` was equal to `blud`, otherwise `player[p]` remains unchanged, `blud` is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field, and `out` is a list containing the value `p` if `player[p]` was equal to `blud`, otherwise `out` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a non-negative integer representing the current time step, `player` is a dictionary where `player[p]` is `[-1, -1]` if `player[p]` was equal to `blud`, otherwise `player[p]` remains unchanged, `blud` is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field, and `out` is a list containing the value `p` if `player[p]` was equal to `blud`, otherwise `out` remains an empty list. The variable `p` is the next key in the `player` dictionary after the current `p`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a non-negative integer representing the current time step, `player` is a dictionary where `player[p]` is `[-1, -1]` if `player[p]` was equal to `blud`, otherwise `player[p]` remains unchanged, `blud` is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field, `out` is a list containing the value `p` if `player[p]` was equal to `blud`, otherwise `out` remains an empty list, `p` is `next_p`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
