Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer representing the current time step, `player` is a dictionary where `player[p]` is `[-1, -1]` if `player[p]` was equal to `blud`, otherwise `player[p]` remains unchanged, `blud` is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field, `out` is a list containing the value `p` if `player[p]` was equal to `blud`, otherwise `out` contains the value `p`, `p` is `next_p`.**

In natural language: The value `p` has been appended to the list `out`. All other variables remain unchanged: `t` is still a non-negative integer, `player` still holds its original values except for `player[p]` if it was equal to `blud`, `blud` remains the same, and `p` is still `next_p`.
