Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code is incomplete and does not fully implement the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Incomplete Implementation**: The provided code only contains two functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) and does not handle the entire game logic as described in the problem statement. It does not handle the movement of players, catching and throwing the Quaffle, scoring goals, or updating the field state.

2. **Missing Logic**:
   - **Movement Handling**: The `func_1` function handles the movement of an object based on direction, but there is no code that processes the list of actions for each player or ball.
   - **Bludger Elimination**: The `func_2` function checks for bludger elimination but does not handle the case where a player carrying the Quaffle is eliminated, which would leave the Quaffle on the field.
   - **Quaffle Handling**: There is no code to handle the Quaffle being caught, thrown, or moved by players.
   - **Goal Scoring**: There is no code to check if a Quaffle has been placed in a goal and to update the score accordingly.
   - **Field State**: The code does not maintain the state of the field or the positions of players, balls, and goals.
   - **Output Events**: The code does not print the required events (e.g., scoring a goal, a player being eliminated) or the final score.

3. **Variable Initialization**: The code uses variables like `player` and `blud` which are not defined anywhere in the provided code snippet.

Given these issues, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description and cannot be considered correct. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
