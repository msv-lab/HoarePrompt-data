### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotations to determine if the program is correct based on the problem description.

#### Code Analysis:

1. **Initialization of the Field and Entities**:
   - The code does read the field and sets up the positions of players, goals, the Quaffle, and the Bludger. This is evident from the loop that processes the input grid:
     ```python
     for i in range(n):
         s = input().split()
         for j in range(m):
             if s[j] == 'RG':
                 rg.append([i, j])
             elif s[j] == 'BG':
                 bg.append([i, j])
             elif s[j] == '.Q':
                 ball = [i, j]
             elif s[j] == '.B':
                 blud = [i, j]
             else:
                 player[s[j]] = [i, j]
     ```
   - This part of the code is correctly implemented.

2. **Processing of Actions**:
   - The code processes each action in a loop:
     ```python
     for t in range(int(input())):
         (p, d) = input().split()[:2]
         if d == 'C':
             carry = p
         elif d == 'T':
             carry = None
             if ball in bg:
                 rs += 1
                 print(t, 'RED GOAL')
                 ball = [n // 2, m // 2]
             elif ball in rg:
                 bs += 1
                 print(t, 'BLUE GOAL')
                 ball = [n // 2, m // 2]
         elif p == '.Q':
             func_1(ball, d)
         elif p == '.B':
             func_1(blud, d)
             func_2(t)
         else:
             func_1(player[p], d)
             func_2(t)
             if carry == p:
                 ball = player[p]
     ```
   - The code handles the different types of actions (move, catch, throw) correctly. It updates the positions of entities and checks for scoring conditions.

3. **Scoring**:
   - The code correctly checks if the Quaffle has been thrown into a goal and updates the score accordingly:
     ```python
     if ball in bg:
         rs += 1
         print(t, 'RED GOAL')
         ball = [n // 2, m // 2]
     elif ball in rg:
         bs += 1
         print(t, 'BLUE GOAL')
         ball = [n // 2, m // 2]
     ```
   - The code also correctly handles the case where a player scores in their own goal.

4. **Final Score Output**:
   - The code prints the final score at the end of the game:
     ```python
     print('FINAL SCORE:', rs, bs)
     ```

5. **Elimination of Players by the Bludger**:
   - The function `func_2(t)` correctly checks if any player is on the same cell as the Bludger and marks them as eliminated:
     ```python
     def func_2(t):
         out = []
         for p in player:
             if player[p] == blud:
                 out.append(p)
                 player[p] = [-1, -1]
         for p in sorted(out):
             print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')
     ```

#### Annotations:

The annotations provided in the code match the expected behavior of the functions and the main loop. They describe the state of the program at key points, confirming that the functions and the main loop are correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of the provided code and the annotations, the program correctly implements all the functionalities required by the problem description. It initializes the field and entities, processes actions, handles scoring, and outputs the final score. The annotations also confirm the correctness of the program's behavior.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
