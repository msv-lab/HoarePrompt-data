Correctness: **False**

The provided code snippets do not fully implement the solution to the problem. Here are some key points that indicate the program is incomplete and incorrect:

1. **Initialization and Data Structures**: The code does not initialize the game field, the positions of players, the Quaffle, the Bludgers, or the goals. It also does not initialize the score counters for the teams.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly updates the position of an object (player, Quaffle, or Bludger) based on the direction ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R'). However, it does not handle the case where the object is a player who is carrying the Quaffle. Also, it does not check if the new position is valid (i.e., within the bounds of the field).

3. **Function `func_2`**: This function is intended to eliminate players who are in the same position as the Bludger. However, it assumes that the variable `blud` holds the position of the Bludger, which is not defined in the provided code. Additionally, it does not handle the case where the player carrying the Quaffle is eliminated.

4. **Handling Actions**: The code does not implement the logic to handle the actions of catching and throwing the Quaffle, or scoring goals. It also does not handle the logic to move the Quaffle to the center of the field after a goal is scored.

5. **Output Events**: The code does not generate the required output events for scoring goals or player eliminations.

6. **Final Score**: The code does not calculate and print the final score after all the actions have been processed.

To make the program correct, all the above points need to be addressed with appropriate logic and data structures.
