### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the provided code against the problem description using the annotated version to understand its behavior and reasoning.

#### Problem Description Key Points:
1. **Field Setup**: The field is initialized with players, goals, the Quaffle, and the Bludger.
2. **Actions**: Players and the Bludger can move, catch, or throw the Quaffle.
3. **Scoring**: A player scores by placing the Quaffle in the opposing team's goal.
4. **Elimination**: A player is eliminated if they are on the same cell as the Bludger.
5. **Output Events**: Events are printed in the order they occur, and the final score is printed at the end.

#### Code Analysis:

1. **Field Initialization**:
   - The field is read and parsed correctly.
   - Goals, players, the Quaffle, and the Bludger are correctly identified and stored.

2. **Movement Handling**:
   - The `func_1` function correctly updates the position of an entity based on the direction.
   - The movement of entities (players, Bludger, and Quaffle) is handled in the main loop.

3. **Bludger Elimination**:
   - The `func_2` function correctly identifies players on the same cell as the Bludger and eliminates them.
   - Players are removed from the game by setting their positions to `[-1, -1]`.

4. **Quaffle Handling**:
   - The Quaffle's position is updated when players move with it.
   - The Quaffle is correctly placed back to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.

5. **Goal Scoring**:
   - The code checks if the Quaffle is in a goal after it is thrown.
   - The score is updated and the correct event is printed when a goal is scored.
   - The Quaffle is moved back to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.

6. **Field State**:
   - The code maintains the state of the field by updating the positions of players, the Quaffle, and the Bludger.

7. **Output Events**:
   - The code prints the required events (scoring a goal, player elimination) and the final score at the end.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the problem description. It handles all the necessary actions, maintains the field state, and outputs the correct events and final score. The original assessment is incorrect as it claims the code is incomplete and does not fully implement the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
