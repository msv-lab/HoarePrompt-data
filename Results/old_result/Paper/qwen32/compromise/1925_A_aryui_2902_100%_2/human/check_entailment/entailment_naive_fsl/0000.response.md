Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. The current implementation simply repeats the first `k` letters of the alphabet `n` times, which does not guarantee that all possible subsequences of length `n` are present.

For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `k = 2`. The possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets are "aa", "ab", "ba", and "bb". The program would output "aabb", which does not contain "ba" as a subsequence.

A correct implementation would need to ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are included in the generated string `s`. One way to achieve this is by using De Bruijn sequences, which are cyclic sequences in which every possible string of a given length appears as a substring. However, the problem specifies that the sequence should be a subsequence, not a substring, so a different approach is needed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def generate_string(n, k):
    if n == 1:
        return ''.join(chr(ord('a') + i) for i in range(k))
    
    # Generate all possible strings of length n using the first k letters
    from itertools import product
    all_subsequences = [''.join(p) for p in product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k], repeat=n)]
    
    # Use a greedy approach to build the string
    s = all_subsequences[0]
    for subseq in all_subsequences[1:]:
        # Find the longest suffix of s that matches a prefix of subseq
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):
            if s[-i:] == subseq[:i]:
                s += subseq[i:]
                break
        else:
            s += subseq
    
    return s

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    print(generate_string(n, k))
```

This implementation generates all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` letters and then constructs a string `s` by ensuring that each new subsequence is added with the minimum number of additional characters. This guarantees that all possible subsequences are included in `s`.
