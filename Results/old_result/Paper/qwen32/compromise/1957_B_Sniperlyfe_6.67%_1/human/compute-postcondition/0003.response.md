Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9 (reduced by the sum of the largest numbers representable with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits for each iteration), and `nums` is a list of `n` elements, each being the largest number representable with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits at the time of its assignment, except the last element which is now the largest number representable with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits plus `k`.**

In simple terms, the last element of the `nums` list has been increased by `k`, while all other elements and variables remain unchanged.
