Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `rev_val` is an empty list, `list_len` is a string representing the first input value, `max_power` is a string representing the second input value, and `operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least one string. If `x_rev` is defined and the length of `str(x_rev)` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is set to the string value of `x`. Otherwise, `rev_res` is an empty string and a `NameError` is raised because `x` is not defined.**
