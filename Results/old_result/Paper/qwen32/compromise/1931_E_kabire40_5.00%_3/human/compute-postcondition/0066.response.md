Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `rev_val` is either an empty list or a list containing the string `'0'`, `list_len` is the first input value as a string, `max_power` is the second input value as a string, `x` is the next element in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`, `y` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the integer value of the input provided, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least one string. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is `'0' + x` if `rev_res` was `'0'` or `x` if `rev_res` was an empty string. Otherwise, `rev_val` contains the string `'0'` and `rev_res` is an empty string.**
