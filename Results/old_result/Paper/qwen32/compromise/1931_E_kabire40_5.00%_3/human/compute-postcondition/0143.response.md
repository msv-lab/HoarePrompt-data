Postcondition: **`x` is incremented by 1. If `x` is even, `val_in` is assigned the integer value of `rev_val[x]` and `rev_res` is updated to include the string representation of `val_in`. Otherwise, `val_in` is assigned the value of `rev_val[x]` and `rev_res` is updated to include the reverse of `val_in` appended to it.**
