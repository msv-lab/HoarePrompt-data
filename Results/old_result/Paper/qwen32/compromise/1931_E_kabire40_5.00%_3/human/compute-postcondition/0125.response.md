Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `list_len` is the first input value as a string, `max_power` is the second input value as a string, `rev_val` is a sorted list of reversed strings from `operational_list` where reversing changed the length and must have at least one element, `rev_res` is a concatenation of strings from `operational_list` where reversing did not change the length, `y` is equal to the length of `operational_list` + 1, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, and `x` is an even integer.**
