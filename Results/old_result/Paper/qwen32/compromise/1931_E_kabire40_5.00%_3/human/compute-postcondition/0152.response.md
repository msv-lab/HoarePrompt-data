Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a value for each test case based on the provided inputs. Specifically, Case_1: If `m` is 0, it returns a specific value or result based on the list `a`. Case_2: If `m` is greater than 0, it returns a different value or result based on the list `a` and the integer `m`.**
