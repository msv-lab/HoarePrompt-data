The code snippet `rev_res = rev_res + x` appends the value of `x` to the existing value of `rev_res`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state and the code, the updated state of `rev_res` will be the concatenation of its previous value and the value of `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `list_len` is the first input value as a string, `max_power` is the second input value as a string, `x` is the (y-1)-th element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of `x` read in reverse order, `y` is equal to the length of `operational_list` + 1, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line and must contain at least `y-1` strings, `rev_res` is the previous value of `rev_res` concatenated with `x`, and `rev_val` is either an empty list or contains ["0"] or `["0", x_reversed]` or `[x_reversed]` where `x_reversed` is the string `x` reversed.**
