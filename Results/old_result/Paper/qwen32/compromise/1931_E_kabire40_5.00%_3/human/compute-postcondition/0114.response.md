The code snippet `rev_res = rev_res + x` appends the value of `x` to the existing value of `rev_res`. Given the initial state, `rev_res` can either be an empty string or `'0'`. After the operation, `rev_res` will be the original value of `rev_res` concatenated with `x`.

If `rev_res` was an empty string, it will now be equal to `x`. If `rev_res` was `'0'`, it will now be `'0' + x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `rev_val` is either an empty list or contains ["0"], `list_len` is the first input value as a string, `max_power` is the second input value as a string, `x` is the y-th element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of `x` read in reverse order, `rev_res` is either `x` or `'0' + x`, `y` is equal to the length of `operational_list` + 2, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line and must contain at least `y` strings. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is `'0' + x` or `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` contains ["0"] and `rev_res` remains `x` or `'0' + x`.**
