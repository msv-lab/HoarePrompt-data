The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `rev_val`. This action does not affect the values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, and `a`). Therefore, the output state includes the newly initialized `rev_val` list along with the preconditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and `rev_val` is an empty list.**
