Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `rev_val` is an empty list, `list_len` is the first input value as a string, `max_power` is the second input value as a string, `x` is equal to the length of `rev_val` (which is now 0), `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x` (which is now 0), `rev_res` is an empty string, `y` is equal to the length of `operational_list` + 1, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line.
Code of the loop:
for x in operational_list:
    x_rev = int(x[::-1])
    if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
        rev_res = rev_res + x
    else:
        rev_val.append(x[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `rev_val` is either an empty list or contains ["0"], `list_len` is the first input value as a string, `max_power` is the second input value as a string, `x` is 0, `x_rev` is 0, `rev_res` is either an empty string or `'0'`, `y` is equal to the length of `operational_list` + 1, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line and must contain at least one string. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is `'0'`. Otherwise, `rev_val` contains ["0"] and `rev_res` remains an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `list_len` is the first input value as a string, `max_power` is the second input value as a string, `x` is the y-th element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of `x` read in reverse order, `y` is equal to the length of `operational_list` + 2, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line and must contain at least `y` strings. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is either `x` or `'0' + x` and `rev_val` is either an empty list or contains ["0"]. Otherwise, `rev_res` is an empty string and `rev_val` contains either `["0", x_reversed]` or `[x_reversed]` where `x_reversed` is the string `x` reversed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `list_len` is the first input value as a string, `max_power` is the second input value as a string, `x` is the (y-1)-th element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of `x` read in reverse order, `y` is equal to the length of `operational_list` + 1, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line and must contain at least `y-1` strings. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is the previous value of `rev_res` concatenated with `x`, and `rev_val` is either an empty list or contains ["0"] or `["0", x_reversed]` or `[x_reversed]`. Otherwise, `rev_res` is either `x` or `'0' + x` or an empty string, and `rev_val` contains either `["0"]` or `[x_reversed]` or `[x_reversed, x_reversed]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
