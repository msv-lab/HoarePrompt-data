Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input**:
   - The first line contains an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, there are four lines, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.

2. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program should output a single integer, which is the area of the square.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The square is guaranteed to have sides parallel to the coordinate axes.
   - The area of the square can be calculated by finding the side length and squaring it.
   - The side length can be determined by calculating the distance between two adjacent corners.

### Analysis of the Provided Program

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`n`) and then processes each test case.

2. **Reading Coordinates**:
   - For each test case, the program reads four coordinate pairs and stores them in a list `coord`.

3. **Sorting Coordinates**:
   - The program sorts the coordinates. Sorting the coordinates helps in easily finding adjacent corners of the square.

4. **Calculating Distances**:
   - The program calculates the squared distance between the first two sorted coordinates (`p1`) and the last two sorted coordinates (`p2`).
     ```python
     p1 = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2
     p2 = (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2
     ```
   - This approach assumes that the first two sorted coordinates and the last two sorted coordinates are adjacent sides of the square, which is not always true. For example, if the coordinates are sorted lexicographically, the first and last coordinates might not be adjacent.

5. **Calculating Area**:
   - The program calculates the area as the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`:
     ```python
     res = math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)
     ```
   - This approach is incorrect because the area of a square is the side length squared, not the product of the side lengths. Moreover, since the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be calculated directly as the absolute difference in either the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of adjacent corners.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the rounded result of the calculated area.

### Conclusion
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the side length of the square. It incorrectly calculates the area by taking the product of the square roots of the distances between the first two and the last two sorted coordinates, which does not correspond to the correct side length of the square.

**Correctness: False**
