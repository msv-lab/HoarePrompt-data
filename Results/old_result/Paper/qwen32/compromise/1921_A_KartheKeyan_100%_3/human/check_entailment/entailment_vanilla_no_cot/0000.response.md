Correctness: **False**

The provided program calculates the area of the square incorrectly. The program sorts the coordinates and then calculates the distances between the first two and the last two points, which is not guaranteed to give the correct side length of the square. Instead, the program should calculate the distances between all pairs of points to find the side length of the square.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        
        # Calculate the distances between all pairs of points
        distances = []
        for i in range(4):
            for j in range(i + 1, 4):
                distance_squared = (coord[i][0] - coord[j][0]) ** 2 + (coord[i][1] - coord[j][1]) ** 2
                distances.append(distance_squared)
        
        # The side length of the square will be the square root of the smallest non-zero distance
        side_length_squared = min(distances)
        side_length = math.sqrt(side_length_squared)
        area = side_length ** 2
        
        print(int(area))
        n -= 1

func()
```

This program calculates the squared distances between all pairs of points and finds the smallest non-zero distance, which corresponds to the side length of the square. The area is then calculated as the square of the side length.
