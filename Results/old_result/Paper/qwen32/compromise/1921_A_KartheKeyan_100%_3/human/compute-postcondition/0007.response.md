The code snippet appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the `coord` list. The variables `t`, `n`, `res`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, except for `coord` which now contains the tuple `(x, y)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is a non-zero integer; `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`; `res` is 0; `i` is the loop variable controlled by `range(4)`; `x` and `y` are integers read from the input.**
