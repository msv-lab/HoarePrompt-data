The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range `4`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range provided to the `range` function, which is `4` in this case. Since the range is fixed and non-zero, the loop will execute regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `coord`, and `res`. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute based on the loop head variables.

However, since the task specifies that we must adhere to the format and consider only the objects in the loop head, we can state that `i` is the loop variable and does not need any specific initial value as it is controlled by the `range` function.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be a non-zero integer; `coord` is an empty list; `res` is 0; `i` is the loop variable controlled by `range(4)`**
