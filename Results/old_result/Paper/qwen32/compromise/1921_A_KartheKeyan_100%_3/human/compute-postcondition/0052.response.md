Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be non-zero; `coord` is a list containing four tuples `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]`; `res` is 0; `i` is 4; `p1` is undefined; `p2` is undefined.`**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed all four iterations, the `coord` list will contain four tuples, each representing a pair of integers `(x, y)` obtained from the input. The variables `t`, `n`, `res`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged from their initial states, and the loop variable `i` will be 4, as the loop iterates over the range from 0 to 3 (inclusive).
