Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is a non-zero integer; `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)` and `(x, y)`; `res` is 0; `i` is 3; `x` and `y` are integers read from the input.**

In simple terms, the list `coord` now contains an additional tuple `(x, y)`, which was read from the input. All other variables retain their initial values.
