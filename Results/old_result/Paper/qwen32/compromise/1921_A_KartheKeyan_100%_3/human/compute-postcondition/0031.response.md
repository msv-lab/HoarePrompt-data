The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The previous values of `x` and `y` are overwritten by the new values read from the input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `coord`, `res`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is 1; `coord` is a list containing two elements `[(original_x, original_y), (x, y)]` where `x` and `y` are the new values read from the input; `res` is 0; `i` is 2; `x` and `y` are the new integers read from the input.**
