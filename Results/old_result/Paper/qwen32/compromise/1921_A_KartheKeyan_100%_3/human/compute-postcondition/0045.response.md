The code snippet `coord.append((x, y))` appends a tuple containing the values of `x` and `y` to the list `coord`. Since `coord` was initially an empty list, it will now contain one tuple `(x, y)`. The values of `t`, `n`, `res`, `i`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be non-zero; `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`; `res` is 0; `i` is 3 (but will be overwritten by the loop); `p1` is undefined; `p2` is undefined; `x` and `y` are integers provided by the input.**
