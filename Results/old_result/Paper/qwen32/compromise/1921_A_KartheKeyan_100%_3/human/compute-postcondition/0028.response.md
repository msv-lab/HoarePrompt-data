The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The initial state specifies that `x` and `y` are the new integers read from the input, but before this line, `x` and `y` were part of the tuple in the `coord` list. After executing the code, `x` and `y` will hold the newly read integer values, and the `coord` list will still contain the original tuple `(x, y)` that was there before the input operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is 1; `coord` is a list containing one element `(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are the original values; `res` is 0; `i` is 1; `x` and `y` are the new integers read from the input**.
