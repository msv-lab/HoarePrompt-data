Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is 1; `coord` is an empty list; `res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`; `i` is 3; `x` and `y` are the new integers read from the input; `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between `coord[0]` and `coord[1]`; `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between `coord[3]` and `coord[2]`.**

In simple terms, the list `coord` has been emptied, while all other variables retain their initial values.
