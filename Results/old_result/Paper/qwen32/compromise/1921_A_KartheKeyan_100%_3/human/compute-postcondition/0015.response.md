The code snippet sorts the list `coord` which contains tuples of `(x, y)`. The sorting is based on the default sorting behavior of tuples in Python, which sorts primarily by the first element and secondarily by the second element if the first elements are equal.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `coord` as it gets sorted. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is a non-zero integer; `coord` is a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`; `res` is 0; `i` is 3; `x` and `y` are the new integers read from the input.**
