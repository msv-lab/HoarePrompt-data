The code appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `res`, `i`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is a non-zero integer; `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`; `res` is 0; `i` is 3; `x` and `y` are the new integers read from the input.**
