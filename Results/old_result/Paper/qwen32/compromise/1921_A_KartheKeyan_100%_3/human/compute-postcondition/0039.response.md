Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is 0; `coord` is a sorted list of four elements `[(sorted_x1, sorted_y1), (sorted_x2, sorted_y2), (sorted_x3, sorted_y3), (sorted_x4, sorted_y4)]`; `res` is `math.sqrt((coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) * (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]))`; `i` is 3; `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`; `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been decremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
