The code snippet `coord = []` reassigns the `coord` variable to an empty list. This means that the previous sorted list of four elements is no longer valid, and `coord` is now an empty list. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `res`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be non-zero; `coord` is an empty list; `res` is `math.sqrt((coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) * (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]))`; `i` is 3; `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`; `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.**

However, since `coord` is now an empty list, the expressions for `res`, `p1`, and `p2` are no longer valid as they rely on elements of `coord` that no longer exist. Therefore, the expressions for `res`, `p1`, and `p2` should be considered undefined in this context.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be non-zero; `coord` is an empty list; `res` is undefined; `i` is 3; `p1` is undefined; `p2` is undefined.**
