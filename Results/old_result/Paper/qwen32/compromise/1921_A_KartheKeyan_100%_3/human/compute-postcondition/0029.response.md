The code appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is 1; `coord` is a list containing two elements `[(original_x, original_y), (x, y)]` where `x` and `y` are the new values read from the input; `res` is 0; `i` is 1; `x` and `y` are the new integers read from the input.**
