Output State: **t** is the integer input value such that 1 <= **t** <= 500; **n** is an integer such that 2 <= **n** <= 100, and for each of the **t** iterations, a list of **n** integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9 has been processed. The output for each iteration is the sum of the two largest integers in the respective list. The state of **t** and the lists themselves remain unchanged after the loop, but the output consists of **t** lines, each containing the sum of the two largest integers from the corresponding list.
