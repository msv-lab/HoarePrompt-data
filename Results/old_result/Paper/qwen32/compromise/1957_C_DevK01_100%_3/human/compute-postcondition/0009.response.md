The code `dp.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `dp`. Initially, `dp` is `[3, 7, 57]`. After removing the first element (`3`), `dp` becomes `[7, 57]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n, each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i` where 1 <= `r_i`, `c_i` <= `n`, `dp` is [7, 57], `i` is 4**.
