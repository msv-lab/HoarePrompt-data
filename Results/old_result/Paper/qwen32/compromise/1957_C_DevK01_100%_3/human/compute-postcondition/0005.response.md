The code snippet modifies the list `dp` by appending a new value calculated based on the last two elements of `dp` and the current value of `i`. The new value is calculated as `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 3 * 10^5
- `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n
- Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i` where 1 <= `r_i`, `c_i` <= `n`
- `dp` is [1, 3]
- `i` is 3

Let's compute the new value to append to `dp`:
- `dp[-1]` is 3 (the last element of `dp`)
- `dp[-2]` is 1 (the second last element of `dp`)
- `i` is 3

The new value is calculated as:
\[ (3 + 2 * (3 - 1) * 1) \% (7 + 10^{9}) \]
\[ = (3 + 2 * 2 * 1) \% (7 + 10^{9}) \]
\[ = (3 + 4) \% (7 + 10^{9}) \]
\[ = 7 \% (7 + 10^{9}) \]
\[ = 7 \% 1000000016 \]
\[ = 7 \]

So, `dp` will be updated to `[1, 3, 7]`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n, each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i` where 1 <= `r_i`, `c_i` <= `n`, `dp` is [1, 3, 7], `i` is 3**
