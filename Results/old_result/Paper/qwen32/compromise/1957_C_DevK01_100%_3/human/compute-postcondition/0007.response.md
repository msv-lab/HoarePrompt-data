The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the loop statement, `i` starts at 2 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 4, and it must still be less than or equal to `n`.

Given that the loop condition is `i in range(2, n + 1)`, we need to ensure that `i` is 4 and that `n` is at least 4 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n, each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i` where 1 <= `r_i`, `c_i` <= `n`, `dp` is [3, 7], `i` is 4**
