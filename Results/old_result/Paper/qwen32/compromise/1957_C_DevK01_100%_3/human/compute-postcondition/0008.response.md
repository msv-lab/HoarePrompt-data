Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n, each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i` where 1 <= `r_i`, `c_i` <= `n`, `dp` is [3, 7, 57], `i` is 4**

Explanation: The list `dp` has been updated by appending a new value calculated as `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`. The new value is `57`, which is `(7 + 2 * (4 - 1) * 3) % 1000000016`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`, and `i` remain unchanged.
