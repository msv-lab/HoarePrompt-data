Output State: **`a` is a list with at least two elements where `a[i - 1]` is at least 2 more than `a[i]`, `counter` is a `Counter` object with `a[i - 1]` appearing at least once, `cnt` is `n - len(a)` where `n` is greater than the length of `a`, `ans` is a list with the new element `a[i - 1] - j - 1` appended twice, `i` is a valid index in the range of `a`, `adv` is calculated as `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])` and must be greater than 0, `j` is 0`**

In natural language: The list `ans` now has an additional element `a[i - 1] - j - 1` appended to it, making it so that this element appears twice in the list. All other variables retain their initial values.
