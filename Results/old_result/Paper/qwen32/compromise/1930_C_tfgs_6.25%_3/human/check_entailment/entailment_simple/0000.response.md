### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to determine its correctness.

**Problem Breakdown:**
1. **Input:** Multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n` and an array `a` of size `n`.
2. **Operations:**
   - Perform `n` operations where in each operation:
     - Choose an index `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n).
     - Insert `a[i] + i` into a set `S` (sets do not allow duplicate elements).
     - Remove `a[i]` from `a` (this shifts indices).
3. **Output:** After all operations, construct an array `b` from `S` sorted in decreasing order. The goal is to maximize the lexicographical order of `b`.

**Code Analysis:**
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Modifying Array `a`:**
   - It modifies each element `a[i]` to `a[i] + i + 1` (note the code uses `i + 1` instead of `i` as in the problem statement, which seems to be a discrepancy).
   - This transformation is crucial because it effectively changes the values that will be inserted into the set `S`.

3. **Handling Duplicates and Sorting:**
   - The code uses a `Counter` to keep track of the frequency of each element in the modified `a`.
   - It then converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in decreasing order.
   - The code then constructs the final array `ans` by inserting additional elements between consecutive elements of the sorted set based on the frequency of the previous element in the original array.

4. **Constructing the Final Array `ans`:**
   - The code iterates through the sorted unique elements of `a` and inserts additional elements between them based on the frequency of the previous element and the remaining count `cnt`.
   - After processing all unique elements, it appends any remaining elements to `ans`.

5. **Printing the Result:**
   - The final array `ans` is printed.

**Key Points:**
- The transformation `a[i] + i + 1` in the code (instead of `a[i] + i` as per the problem statement) seems to be a mistake.
- The logic for inserting additional elements between unique elements is based on the frequency of the previous element, which is intended to maximize the lexicographical order of `b`.

**Conclusion:**
The code seems to have a discrepancy in the transformation step (`i + 1` vs `i`) and the logic for inserting additional elements is based on the assumption that `a[i] + i` is used, which is not the case in the code. This discrepancy could lead to incorrect results.

### Correctness: **False**
