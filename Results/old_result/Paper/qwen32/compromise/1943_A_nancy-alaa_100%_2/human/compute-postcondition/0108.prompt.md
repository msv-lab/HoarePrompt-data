Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mpp = Counter(arr)
    first = False
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i not in mpp.keys():
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1:
            first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop prints the first integer `i` that is not in `mpp.keys()` or the first integer `i` such that `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`. The variable `first` will be `True` if an integer `i` with `mpp[i] == 1` has been encountered, and the variable `i` will be the last value it took before the loop broke.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop completes all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = n`. If `n` is not in `mpp.keys()` or `mpp[n] == 1` and `first` is `True`, it prints `n` and breaks. Otherwise, it completes all iterations without printing anything.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `mpp` remains unchanged, `first` is `False` if no integer with a frequency of 1 was encountered after the first occurrence of such an integer, and `i` is `n + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
