Output State: **`n` must be at least `i + 1`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split by spaces, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each integer in `arr`. If `i` was not a key in `mpp` before the if statement, `first` is True and `i` becomes a key in `mpp` with a frequency of 1. Otherwise, `first` remains unchanged. `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and we exit the most internal loop or if statement. The other variables remain unchanged.
