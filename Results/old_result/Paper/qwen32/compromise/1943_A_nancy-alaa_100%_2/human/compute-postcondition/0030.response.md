To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state:

1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4.
2. `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0.
3. `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input line and converting each split component to an integer.
4. `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
5. `first` is a boolean.
6. `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).
7. There is a condition that if `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

The `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i` at the point of execution. However, the exact value of `i` is not explicitly given in the initial state. We know that `i` is incremented by 1 at some point, but the initial value of `i` is not specified. Therefore, we can describe the output in terms of the value of `i` at the point where the print statement is executed.

Given the information, the most precise description of what will be printed is the value of `i` at the point of execution, which is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Output: **i (where i is the value of i after it has been incremented by 1)**
