The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these two variables. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value, and `n` must be such that `i` is still less than `n + 1`.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input line and converting each split component to an integer; `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`; `first` is a boolean. If `first` is True and `i` is a key in `mpp` with `mpp[i]` equal to 1, then `first` remains True. Otherwise, `first` remains True and the condition inside the if statement is not satisfied.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, we adjust `i` to be `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input line and converting each split component to an integer; `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`; `first` is a boolean; `i` is `i + 1`**
