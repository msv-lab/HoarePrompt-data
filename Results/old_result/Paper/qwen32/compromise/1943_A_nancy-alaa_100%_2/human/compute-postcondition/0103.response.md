Output State: **`n` must be at least `i + 2`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split by spaces, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is `True`, `i` is `i + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, and `i` remain the same, but we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
