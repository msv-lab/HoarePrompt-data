To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, let's break down the behavior of the loop based on the provided conditions and the given output states after the first 3 iterations.

The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n` (inclusive). The main conditions inside the loop are:
1. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, the loop breaks, and `i` is printed.
2. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`, the loop breaks, and `i` is printed.
3. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `False`, `first` is set to `True`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- After the first iteration (`i = 0`), `i` was in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[0]` was not equal to 1.
- After the second iteration (`i = 1`), `i` was in `mpp.keys()`, `mpp[1]` was equal to 1, and `first` was `False`, so `first` was set to `True`.
- After the third iteration (`i = 2`), `i` was in `mpp.keys()`, `mpp[2]` was not equal to 1, and `first` remained `True`.

The loop will continue until one of the break conditions is met. The loop will either break when it finds an `i` not in `mpp.keys()` or when it finds an `i` such that `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`.

The output state after all iterations will be determined by the first `i` that meets one of the break conditions. Since the loop runs up to `i = n`, the final value of `i` will be the smallest integer not in `mpp.keys()` or the smallest integer `i` such that `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`.

To determine the exact output, we need to know the values of `n` and the contents of `arr` (and thus `mpp`). However, based on the loop's behavior, we can describe the final state as follows:

- The loop will print the first integer `i` that is not in `mpp.keys()` or the first integer `i` such that `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`.
- The variable `first` will be `True` if an integer `i` with `mpp[i] == 1` has been encountered during the loop.
- The variable `i` will be the last value it took before the loop broke.

Given the loop's nature, the final output state will be when the loop breaks, and it will print the value of `i` that caused the break.

Output State: **The loop prints the first integer `i` that is not in `mpp.keys()` or the first integer `i` such that `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`. The variable `first` will be `True` if an integer `i` with `mpp[i] == 1` has been encountered, and the variable `i` will be the last value it took before the loop broke.**

In simpler terms, the loop will print the smallest integer `i` that either does not exist in `arr` or is the first unique integer encountered after another unique integer has already been found.
