Postcondition: **`n` must be at least `i + 2`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split by spaces, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each integer in `arr`, and `i` is `i + 2`. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking out of the loop or if statement.**
