Output State: **`n` is at least -1, `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp`, `mpp[i]` is equal to 1, and `first` is true, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The values of `n`, `i`, `mpp[i]`, and `first` remain unchanged. The code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
