Let's analyze the given information step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is at least 1.
- `i` is initialized to the value of `n`.
- `mpp` and `first` remain unchanged.
- The code snippet contains a print statement: `print(i)`.

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is directly set to the value of `n` as per the initial state.
- The values of `mpp` and `first` are mentioned but do not affect the value of `i` directly.
- The condition `if mpp[i] == 1 and first is True` is mentioned but it only affects the control flow (breaking loops or if statements) and not the value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
- Since `i` is directly assigned the value of `n` and there are no operations that modify `i` before the print statement, the value of `i` remains `n`.
- The print statement `print(i)` will output the value of `i`, which is `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **n (where n is the initial value assigned to i)**
