Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split by spaces; `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each integer in `arr`.**

In simple terms, `n` remains the input integer, `arr` retains its list of integers, and a new variable `mpp` is created, which is a Counter object that holds the count of each integer in the list `arr`.
