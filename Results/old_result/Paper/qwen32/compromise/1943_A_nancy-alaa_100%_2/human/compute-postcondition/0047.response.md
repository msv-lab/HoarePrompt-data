Given the initial state, we have the following information:
- `n` is at least -1 (though `n` is not used in the print statement, it is mentioned for completeness).
- `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp`.
- `mpp[i]` is equal to 1 (this indicates that the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `mpp` is 1).
- `first` is true (though `first` is not used in the print statement, it is mentioned for completeness).

The print statement is:
```python
print(i)
```

Since `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp`, and the exact value of `i` is not specified, the output will be the value of `i` itself, which is a key in the dictionary.

Output: **i (where i is a key in the dictionary mpp)**
