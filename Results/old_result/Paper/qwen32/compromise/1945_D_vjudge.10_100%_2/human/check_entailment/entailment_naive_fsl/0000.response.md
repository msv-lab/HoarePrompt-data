Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach a position among the first `m` people in the queue. However, the current implementation is flawed and does not correctly account for the costs associated with bribing people to move up the queue.

Here are a few issues with the current implementation:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Costs**:
   - The program incorrectly calculates the total cost `x` by adding the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each person. This does not correctly account for the fact that Kirill needs to pay `a[i]` to move past the `i-th` person and `b[k]` for each person `k` between `j` and `i` when moving from position `i` to `j`.
   
2. **Incorrect Use of `pergunta`**:
   - The variable `pergunta` is initialized to `float('inf')` and is supposed to store the minimum number of coins needed to reach a position among the first `m` people. However, the way it is updated in the loop does not correctly reflect the minimum cost to reach any of the first `m` positions.

3. **Logic Error in Loop**:
   - The loop iterates from the end of the queue to the beginning, updating `pergunta` and `x` based on the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This logic does not correctly simulate the process of bribing people to move up the queue and does not account for the cumulative cost of bribing multiple people.

Here is a potential counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness of the program:

**Input:**
```
1
5 3
10 20 30 40 50
1 2 3 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Kirill can bribe the person at position 5 (cost 1) to move to position 4, and then bribe the person at position 4 (cost 1) to move to position 3. The total cost is 1 + 2 = 3.

**Actual Output of Provided Program:**
The provided program will not produce the correct output for this case because the logic for calculating the minimum cost is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the output is `False`.
