The function `func_1` calculates and prints the minimum value of `x + a[i]` for all `i < m` after processing the lists `a` and `b` and the integer `n`. Here, `x` is the cumulative sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` from index `0` to `n-1`. The function does not modify the input lists `a` and `b`, nor the integers `n` and `m`.
