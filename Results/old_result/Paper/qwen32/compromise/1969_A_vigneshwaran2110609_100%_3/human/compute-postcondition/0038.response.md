The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `x`, or `flag`. It only terminates the nearest enclosing loop or conditional statement. Therefore, the values of `i`, `x`, and `flag` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is greater than 2, `flag` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
