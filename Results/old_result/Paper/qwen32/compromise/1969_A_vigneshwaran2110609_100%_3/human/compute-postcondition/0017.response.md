The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `2`. The initial state provides a detailed description of various variables and their conditions, but the `print` statement is independent of these variables and directly outputs the number `2`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print(2)`.
2. This statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `x`, `l`, `i`, `flag`) mentioned in the initial state.
3. The value to be printed is explicitly `2`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply `2`.

Output: **2**
