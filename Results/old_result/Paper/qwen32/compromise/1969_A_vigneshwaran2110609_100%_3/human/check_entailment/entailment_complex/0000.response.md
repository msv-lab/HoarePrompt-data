Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program is supposed to determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party. However, the logic implemented in the program is flawed.

The program checks if there exists an index `i` such that `p[p[i] - 1] == i + 1`. If such an index exists, it prints `2`, indicating that only two invitations are needed. Otherwise, it prints `3`.

However, this logic does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations needed. The condition `p[p[i] - 1] == i + 1` checks if there is a mutual best friendship, but it does not consider other possible configurations that might require fewer than 3 invitations.

For example, in the second test case provided in the problem statement:
```
4
2 3 4 1
```
The program would print `3` because there is no mutual best friendship. However, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2, and 3, and friends 1 and 2 will attend, which means only 3 invitations are needed, but the program correctly identifies this as the minimum in this case. However, the program does not correctly handle all cases where fewer than 3 invitations might be needed.

The correct approach would involve checking all possible pairs of friends and determining if sending invitations to those pairs is sufficient to bring at least 2 friends to the party. If no such pair exists, then 3 invitations are necessary.

Given the current implementation, the program does not always produce the correct output for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
