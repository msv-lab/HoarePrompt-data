Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp must send so that at least 2 friends attend the party. A friend will attend if both the friend and their best friend receive an invitation.

### Key Observations:
1. If there is a pair of friends (i, j) such that i is the best friend of j and j is the best friend of i (i.e., `p_i = j` and `p_j = i`), then sending invitations to both friends will ensure both attend.
2. If no such pair exists, Monocarp must invite at least 3 friends to ensure at least 2 attend (since inviting 2 friends might not guarantee both of their best friends are also invited).

### Code Analysis:
Let's break down the provided code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)
```

1. The outer loop runs `n` times, where `n` is the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, `x` (the number of friends) is read.
3. The list `l` contains the best friends of each friend.
4. The inner loop checks if there exists a pair of friends (i, j) such that `p_i = j` and `p_j = i`. This is checked by `if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`.
5. If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop.
6. If no such pair is found after the loop, it prints `3`.

### Issues in the Code:
1. The variable `flag` is set but never used. This is not a critical issue but is unnecessary.
2. The logic for checking if there exists a pair of mutual best friends is correct, but the code does not handle the case where there are multiple such pairs efficiently.
3. If a pair is found, the code correctly prints `2` and breaks out of the loop.
4. If no pair is found, the code correctly prints `3`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of invitations required. It correctly identifies if there exists a pair of mutual best friends and handles the case where no such pair exists. The code does not have any logical errors based on the problem statement.

Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **True**
