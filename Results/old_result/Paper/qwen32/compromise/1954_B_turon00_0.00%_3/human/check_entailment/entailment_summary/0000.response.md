Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The task is to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. The program instead calculates the minimum length of any contiguous subarray that contains only the most frequent element, which is not the correct approach.

The key issue is that the program does not actually check if the array stops being beautiful after removing a certain number of elements. Instead, it focuses on finding the shortest subarray of identical elements and assumes that removing elements from this subarray will make the array not beautiful, which is not necessarily true.

For example, in the fourth test case, the array is `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`. The program will find that the shortest subarray of identical elements is of length 1 (the `5`), and it will output `1`. However, removing just the `5` does not make the array stop being beautiful, as the remaining array `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]` is still beautiful. The correct answer for this test case is `3`, as removing the first three `3`s results in the array `[5, 3, 3, 3]`, which is not beautiful.

To correctly solve the problem, the program would need to simulate the removal of elements and check if the resulting array is still beautiful, which is a more complex task.

Correctness: **False**
