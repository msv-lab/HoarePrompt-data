You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

        aa = set(a)
        if len(aa) == 1:
            print(-1)
        cnt = 0
        ans = n
        for i in range(n):

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. The logic in the program has several issues:

1. **Logic for Counting Consecutive Elements**: The program attempts to count consecutive elements and finds the minimum count of such consecutive elements. However, this approach does not correctly address the problem of making the array stop being beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where the array has multiple segments of consecutive elements correctly. It only considers the length of the longest segment of identical elements and does not consider the possibility of removing elements from different segments to break the beautiful property.

3. **Example Case Failure**: Consider the following test case:
   ```
   1
   7
   1 2 1 2 1 2 1
   ```
   The program will output `1`, but the correct answer is `3`. Removing any single element will not make the array stop being beautiful. The correct approach would be to remove three elements to break the alternating pattern.

4. **General Case Failure**: The program does not account for the possibility of breaking the beautiful property by removing elements from different segments. It only considers the length of consecutive elements and does not consider the overall structure of the array.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect. A correct solution would involve analyzing the structure of the array and determining the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beautiful property.
