Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `tmp` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, `ans` is `n` if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `ans` is 0, and `cnt` is 1 if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0.**
