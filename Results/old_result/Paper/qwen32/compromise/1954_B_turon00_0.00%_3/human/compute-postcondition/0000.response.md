Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 3 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**

Natural Language: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of the input integer, which is within the range of 1 to 10^4. The other variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
