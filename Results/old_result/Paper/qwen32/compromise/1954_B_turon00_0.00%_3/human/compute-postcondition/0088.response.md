The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and `cnt`; `cnt` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` if the loop ended with such a sequence; `t` is `t - 1` and is greater than 0; `n` is the input integer; `a` is the input list of integers; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `aa` is the set containing unique elements from `a`.**
