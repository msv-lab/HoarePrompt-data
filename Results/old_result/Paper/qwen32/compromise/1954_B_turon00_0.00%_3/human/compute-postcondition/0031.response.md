The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable in this context and does not affect the loop's continuation, the only variable we need to adjust is `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must have been decremented by 1, so to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, `t` is greater than 0**
