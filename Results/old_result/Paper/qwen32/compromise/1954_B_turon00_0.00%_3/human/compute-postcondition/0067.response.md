Postcondition: **`ans` is the minimum of its current value and `cnt`; `t` is `t - 1` and remains greater than 0; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is the new input list of integers; `tmp` remains `a[0]`; `aa` is the set containing unique elements from `a`; `cnt` remains the count of the last sequence of `tmp` values. If `len(aa) == 1`, then the conditions stated above hold without any change. Otherwise, the conditions stated above also hold without any change since there is no else part to modify them.**
