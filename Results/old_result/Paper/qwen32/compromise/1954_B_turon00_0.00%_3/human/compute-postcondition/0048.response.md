The code snippet provided increments the variable `cnt` by 1. None of the other variables (`ans`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, `i`) are modified by this code. Therefore, their states remain the same as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`ans` is `n` if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, `i` is `i + 1`, `cnt` is incremented by 1.**
