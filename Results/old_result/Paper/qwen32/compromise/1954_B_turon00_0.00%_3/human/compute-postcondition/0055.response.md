The code snippet sets `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the value of `i` or the calculation of `ans`, which is the minimum value between its previous value and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is now 0, `ans` will be the minimum of its previous value and 0.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and 0, `cnt` is 0.**
