Postcondition: **`ans` is the new input integer `n`, `t` is `t - 1` and remains greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the new input list of integers, `tmp` remains `a[0]`, `aa` is the set containing unique elements from `a`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 1; otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is the minimum between the new input integer `n` and 0.**
