To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop's behavior and the given information.

The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the following steps are performed:
1. Read the integer `n` and the list `a` of `n` integers.
2. Initialize `tmp` to the first element of `a`, `aa` to the set of unique elements in `a`, and `cnt` to 0.
3. If all elements in `a` are the same, print `-1` and continue to the next test case.
4. Iterate over the list `a` to find the minimum length of consecutive elements equal to `tmp`. Store this minimum length in `ans`.
5. Print `ans` for the current test case.

After all `t` iterations, the loop will have processed all test cases, and the final output state will reflect the results of these iterations.

Given the information about the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can deduce the final state after all `t` iterations:
- `t` will be 0, as all iterations will have been completed.
- `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, `cnt`, and `ans` will reflect the state of the last iteration, but they are not relevant for the final output state since the loop does not retain these values between iterations.

The only relevant output after all iterations is the sequence of `ans` values printed for each test case.

Thus, the final output state is simply the sequence of `ans` values printed for each of the `t` test cases.

Output State: **the sequence of `ans` values printed for each of the `t` test cases.**

In natural language, after all the iterations, the output state consists of the series of results (`ans` values) printed for each test case. Each result is the minimum length of consecutive elements equal to the first element of the list `a` for that test case, or `-1` if all elements in `a` are the same.
