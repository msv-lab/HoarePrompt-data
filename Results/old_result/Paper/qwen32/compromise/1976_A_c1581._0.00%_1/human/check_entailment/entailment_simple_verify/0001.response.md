### Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the program and verify its behavior against the problem requirements using the annotated code.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It correctly identifies the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case accordingly.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password (`n`) and the password string itself.

2. **Function `func_1(password)`:**
   - **Separating Digits and Letters:**
     - The function initializes two empty lists: `digits` and `letters`.
     - It iterates over each character in the password:
       - If the character is a digit, it appends it to the `digits` list.
       - If the character is a letter, it appends it to the `letters` list.
     - This step is correctly implemented and aligns with the problem requirements.
   
   - **Checking Order of Digits and Letters:**
     - The function initializes `last_digit_index` to `-1`.
     - It iterates over each character in the password with its index:
       - If the character is a digit, it updates `last_digit_index` to the current index.
       - If the character is a letter and `last_digit_index` is not `-1` (indicating a digit has been seen before), it returns 'NO' because a letter follows a digit.
     - This step ensures that no letter comes after a digit, which is a requirement.

   - **Checking Sorted Order:**
     - The function checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
     - The function checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
     - If both conditions are met, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
     - This step ensures that all digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order, which is also a requirement.

3. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations provided in the annotated version accurately describe the state of the program at key points.
   - They confirm that the program correctly separates digits and letters, checks the order, and verifies the sorted condition.

4. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a password is strong according to the problem's requirements.
   - The annotations validate each step of the function, ensuring that the program behaves as expected.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if a password is strong according to the problem's requirements. The original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
