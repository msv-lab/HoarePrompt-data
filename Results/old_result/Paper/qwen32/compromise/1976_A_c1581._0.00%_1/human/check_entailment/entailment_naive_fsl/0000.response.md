Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it does not correctly check the condition that all digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order and all letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order. The code checks if the digits and letters in the password are sorted, but it does not ensure that the digits and letters themselves are sorted within their respective groups in the password.

Let's consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
6
a1b2c3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation of the Test Case:**
- The password contains both letters and digits.
- The letters 'a', 'b', 'c' are in non-decreasing order.
- The digits '1', '2', '3' are in non-decreasing order.
- However, the digit '1' comes after the letter 'a', and the digit '2' comes after the letter 'b', which violates the condition that there should be no digit that comes after a letter.

**Program Output:**
The provided program will output "YES" for this input because it checks the sorted order of digits and letters separately but does not enforce the condition that all digits must come after all letters.

### Corrected Code:
To fix the issue, we need to ensure that all digits come after all letters and that both groups are sorted. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    
    # Check if all letters are before any digits
    if any(char.isdigit() for char in letters):
        return 'NO'
    
    # Check if all digits are after any letters
    if any(char.isalpha() for char in digits):
        return 'NO'
    
    # Check if letters are sorted
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    
    # Check if digits are sorted
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    
    return 'YES'
```

This corrected code ensures that all letters come before any digits and that both groups are sorted.
