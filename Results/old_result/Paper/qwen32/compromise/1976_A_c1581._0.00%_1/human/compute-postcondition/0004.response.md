The code snippet only initializes a variable `last_digit_index` to `-1` and does not affect the values of `password`, `digits`, or `letters`. Therefore, the values of `password`, `digits`, and `letters` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `digits` is a list containing all the digit characters from the `password`; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the `password`; `last_digit_index` is -1.**
