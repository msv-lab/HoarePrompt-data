Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` is between 1 and `n` and `p_i` is not equal to `i`. The function returns a value for each test case based on the given constraints, but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.**
