The code snippet provided initializes the variable `alphabet` with the lowercase letters of the English alphabet using `string.ascii_lowercase`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78; `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.**
