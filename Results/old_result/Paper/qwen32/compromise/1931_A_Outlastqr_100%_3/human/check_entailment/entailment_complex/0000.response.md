Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the given problem description and the provided execution states.

### Problem Breakdown
The task is to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to a given integer `n` when the positions of the letters in the alphabet are summed up. The letters are indexed from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, and so on up to 'z' which is 26. 

### Program Analysis
The program reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78). It then constructs a 3-letter word based on the value of `n` and prints it. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program uses `string.ascii_lowercase` to get a string of all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.

2. **Loop through Test Cases:**
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
   - It initializes an empty string `word` which will store the resulting 3-letter word.

3. **Constructing the Word:**
   - If `n > 52`, the word is constructed as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. 
     - This means the first letter is determined by `n - 53`, and the remaining two letters are 'z'. 
     - This makes sense because the maximum sum for 'zz' is 26 + 26 = 52, so any `n > 52` would need the first letter to make up the difference.
   - If `27 < n ≤ 52`, the word is constructed as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
     - Here, the first letter is 'a', the second letter is determined by `n - 28`, and the third letter is 'z'.
     - This works because the sum of 'a' and 'z' is 1 + 26 = 27, so any `n` in this range would need the second letter to make up the difference.
   - If `n == 27`, the word is `'aay'`.
     - This is a specific case where the sum of 'a' + 'a' + 'y' is exactly 27.
   - If `n < 27`, the word is constructed as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.
     - Here, the first two letters are 'a', and the third letter is determined by `n - 3`.
     - This works because the sum of 'aa' is 1 + 1 = 2, so any `n` in this range would need the third letter to make up the difference.

### Verification Against Example
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1: n = 24**
   - `n < 27`, so the word is `'aa' + alphabet[24 - 3]` which is `'aa' + 'u'` = `'aau'`. 
   - However, the expected output is `'aav'`, which means there's a mistake in the program for this specific case.

2. **Test Case 2: n = 70**
   - `n > 52`, so the word is `alphabet[70 - 53] + 'zz'` which is `alphabet[17] + 'zz'` = `'rzz'`.
   - This matches the expected output.

3. **Test Case 3: n = 3**
   - `n < 27`, so the word is `'aa' + alphabet[3 - 3]` which is `'aa' + 'a'` = `'aaa'`.
   - This matches the expected output.

4. **Test Case 4: n = 55**
   - `n > 52`, so the word is `alphabet[55 - 53] + 'zz'` which is `alphabet[2] + 'zz'` = `'bzz'`.
   - However, the expected output is `'czz'`, which means there's a mistake in the program for this specific case.

5. **Test Case 5: n = 48**
   - `n > 52` is false, but `n > 27` is true, so the word is `'a' + alphabet[48 - 28] + 'z'` which is `'a' + 'u' + 'z'` = `'auz'`.
   - This matches the expected output.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when `n` is close to the boundaries of the conditions. For example, it incorrectly handles `n = 24` and `n = 55`.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
