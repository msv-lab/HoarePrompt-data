Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for all possible input values. Let's analyze the program logic and identify the issues:

1. **Handling of the Input Range**: The program uses hardcoded conditions to construct the word based on the value of `n`. These conditions do not cover all possible cases for `n` in the range 3 to 78.

2. **Constructing the Word**:
   - For `n > 52`, the program constructs the word as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. This logic is incorrect because it does not ensure the smallest lexicographical order.
   - For `n > 27`, the program constructs the word as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. This is also incorrect for the same reason.
   - For `n == 27`, the program constructs the word as `'aay'`. This is correct but only covers a specific case.
   - For `n <= 27`, the program constructs the word as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`. This is incorrect because it does not handle all cases correctly, especially when `n` is close to 27.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should iterate through possible combinations of three letters and find the combination that sums to `n` and is lexicographically smallest. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        for a in range(1, 27):
            for b in range(1, 27):
                for c in range(1, 27):
                    if a + b + c == n:
                        current_word = chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96)
                        if word == '' or current_word < word:
                            word = current_word
        print(word)

func()
```

This approach ensures that we check all possible combinations of three letters to find the lexicographically smallest word that sums to `n`.
