### Reasoning:

The goal of the problem is to maximize the sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting that sum anywhere in the array. The final result should be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Key Observations:
1. **Sum of the Array (`s`)**: The initial sum of the array is `s`. This is a baseline value that we start with.
2. **Maximum Positive Subarray Sum (`t`)**: We need to identify the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within the array. This is done using Kadane's algorithm, which efficiently finds the maximum subarray sum in linear time.
3. **Doubling the Maximum Positive Subarray Sum**: Each operation can potentially double the maximum positive subarray sum found (`t`). This is because the best strategy is to keep adding the maximum positive subarray sum back into the array repeatedly.
4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the results can be very large, we use modulo \(10^9 + 7\) throughout our calculations to ensure they fit within standard integer limits.

#### Explanation of the Code:
- **Reading Input**: The code reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n`, the number of operations `k`, and the array `a`.
- **Initial Sum Calculation**: It calculates the initial sum of the array `s`.
- **Finding Maximum Subarray Sum (`t`)**: Using Kadane's algorithm, it finds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in `a`.
- **Calculating the Final Answer**:
  - The initial answer `ans` is set to `(s + t) % MOD`.
  - For each subsequent operation (up to `k-1`), the maximum subarray sum `t` is doubled and added to `ans`, taking care to apply the modulo operation at each step to prevent overflow.
- **Output**: The final value of `ans` for each test case is printed.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the strategy to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations. It uses Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum and strategically doubles this sum in each operation while handling large numbers with modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Therefore, the code is correct.
