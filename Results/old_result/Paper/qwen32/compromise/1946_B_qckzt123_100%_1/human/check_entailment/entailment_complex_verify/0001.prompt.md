You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

For each test case, it calculates a specific value based on the sum of the list and the maximum subarray sum, then prints the result modulo `1000000007`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations. Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array. The final result should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Key Observations

1. **Maximizing the Sum**: To maximize the sum, we should focus on adding the largest possible positive sums repeatedly. The best strategy is to identify the maximum subarray sum (using Kadane's algorithm) and use it in subsequent operations.
2. **Kadane's Algorithm**: This algorithm helps in finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray efficiently.
3. **Doubling the Maximum Subarray Sum**: Once we have the maximum subarray sum (`t`), each subsequent operation can double this sum (since we can add the entire array sum and the previously added maximum subarray sum).
4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the sum can become very large, we need to take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at each step to prevent overflow and ensure the result fits within standard integer limits.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the program:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `T`, and for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the number of operations `k`, and the array elements `a`.
2. **Calculating Initial Sum**: It calculates the initial sum of the array `s`.
3. **Finding Maximum Subarray Sum**: Using a loop similar to Kadane's algorithm, it finds the maximum subarray sum `t`.
4. **Initial Answer Calculation**: The initial answer is calculated as `(s + t) % MOD`.
5. **Doubling the Maximum Subarray Sum**: For each of the remaining `k-1` operations, it doubles the maximum subarray sum `t` and adds it to the answer, taking modulo `MOD` at each step.
6. **Printing the Result**: Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

### Correctness Verification

- **Kadane's Algorithm**: The program correctly implements Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum.
- **Doubling Strategy**: The strategy of doubling the maximum subarray sum and adding it to the total sum is correct for maximizing the array sum after `k` operations.
- **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation is applied correctly at each step to ensure the result does not overflow.

Given these points, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
