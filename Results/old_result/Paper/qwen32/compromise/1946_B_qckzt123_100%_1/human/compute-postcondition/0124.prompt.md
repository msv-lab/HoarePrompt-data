You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
        
        s = sum(a)
        
        t, tmp = 0, 0
        
        for x in a:
            tmp += x
            if tmp < 0:
                tmp = 0
            t = max(tmp, t)
        
        ans = ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD
        
        for i in range(k - 1):
            t *= 2
            t %= MOD
            ans += t
            ans %= MOD
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The final value of `ans` after all `T` iterations, which is the accumulated sum of `ans` values from each iteration, modulo `MOD`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. Specifically, if the conditions defined in the problem are met, it returns a particular value or performs a specific operation, otherwise, it adheres to the problem's specified behavior for those conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
