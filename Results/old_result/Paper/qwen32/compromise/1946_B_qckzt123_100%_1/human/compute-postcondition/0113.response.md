The code snippet `ans += t` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `t`. Given the initial state, `ans` was initially calculated as `((s + 2*t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`. After adding `t` to `ans`, the new value of `ans` becomes `((s + 2*t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `n` and `k` are integers where `k` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `((twice the maximum accumulated sum of any contiguous subarray within `a`) % MOD * 2) % MOD`, `tmp` is 0, `ans` is `(((s + 2*t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t)`, `i` is 1**.
