The code snippet updates the value of `t` to be the maximum of `tmp` and the current value of `t`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `max(0, 2 * x)`
- `tmp` is `0` if it was initially less than 0, otherwise `tmp` remains `2 * x + x`
- `T` is greater than 0
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element
- `s` is the sum of the list `a`
- `x` is the next element in the list `a`

After executing `t = max(tmp, t)`, the new value of `t` will be the larger of the two values `tmp` and `t`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is `max(tmp, max(0, 2 * x))`; `tmp` is `0` if it was initially less than 0, otherwise `tmp` is `3 * x`; `T` is greater than 0; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element; `s` is the sum of the list `a`; `x` is the next element in the list `a`.**
