The code snippet provided sets `tmp` to 0. This changes the value of `tmp` from its previous state (which was 0 + `x` and less than 0) to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `s` is the sum of the list `a`.**
