The code snippet sets `tmp` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, or `x`. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `tmp`.

Output State: **`t` is `max(0, 2 * x)`, `tmp` is 0, `T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, and `s` is the sum of the list `a`, `x` is the next element in the list `a`**.
