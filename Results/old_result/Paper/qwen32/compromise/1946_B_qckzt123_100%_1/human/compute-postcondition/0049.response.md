Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 2; `n` is an integer read from input; `k` is an integer read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input that has at least one element; `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `t` is 0; `tmp` is an integer such that `tmp` is less than 0; the current value of `tmp` is the result of adding `n` to its previous value, which makes it negative.**
