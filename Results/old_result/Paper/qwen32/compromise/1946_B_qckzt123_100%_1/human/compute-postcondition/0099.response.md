The code snippet `tmp += x` adds the value of `x` to `tmp`. Since `x` is the next element in the list `a`, and `tmp` was previously `max(tmp, 0)`, the new value of `tmp` will be the old value of `tmp` plus `x`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `tmp`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `max(tmp, 0)`, `tmp` is `max(tmp, 0) + x`, `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + sum(t * 2^i % MOD for i in range(k-1))) % MOD`, `x` is the next element in `a` (specifically, `x` is `a[i+1]` if `x` was `a[i]` in the previous iteration)**.
