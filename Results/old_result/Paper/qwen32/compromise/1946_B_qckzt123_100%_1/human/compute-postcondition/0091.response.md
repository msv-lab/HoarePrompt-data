Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from the new input, `a` is a new list of integers read from input that must have at least 1 element, `s` is the sum of the elements in the new `a`, `t` is 0, and `tmp` is 0 if `tmp` was originally less than 0. `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + sum(t * 2^i % MOD for i in range(k-1))) % MOD`.**
