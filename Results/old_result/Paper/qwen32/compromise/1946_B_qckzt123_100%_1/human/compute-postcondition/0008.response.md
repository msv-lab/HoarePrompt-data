The code snippet `tmp += x` increments the value of `tmp` by the value of `x`. However, `x` is not defined in the given initial state, which means its value is unknown. Therefore, the only thing we can determine is that `tmp` will be increased by whatever value `x` holds.

Since `x` is not specified, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for `tmp`. We can only express the new state of `tmp` in terms of `x`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `tmp` is 0 + `x`, `T` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `s` is the sum of the list `a`.**
