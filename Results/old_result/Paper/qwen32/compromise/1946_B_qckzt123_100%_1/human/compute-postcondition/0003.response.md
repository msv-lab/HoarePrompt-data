The code reads a line from standard input, splits it into two parts, converts these parts to integers, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state does not specify the values of `n` and `k`, but it does specify that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, and `T` must be greater than 0. After executing the code, `n` and `k` will have the values read from the input, while `t` and `T` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.**
