Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `((twice the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within `a`) * 2) % MOD`, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative sums, `ans` is `(((s + (twice the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within `a`) % MOD) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.`**

Explanation: The value of `t` has been updated to be `t % MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged.
