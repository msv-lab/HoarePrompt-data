Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is twice the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within `a`, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative sums, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `t` has been doubled. All other variables remain unchanged, including `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, `tmp`, and `ans`.
