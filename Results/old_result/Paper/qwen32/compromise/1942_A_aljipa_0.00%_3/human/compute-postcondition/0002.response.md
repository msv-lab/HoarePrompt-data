To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.

The loop runs `t` times, and for each iteration:
- It reads two integers `n` and `k`.
- Depending on the values of `n` and `k`, it initializes the list `res` as follows:
  - If `k == n`, `res` is initialized to a list of `n` ones: `[1] * n`.
  - If `k == 1`, `res` is initialized to a range from 0 to `n-1`: `range(n)`.
  - If neither condition is met (`k != n` and `k != 1`), `res` is initialized to a list containing a single element `-1`: `[-1]`.
- It prints the contents of `res`.

The output state after all iterations will be a series of printed lists corresponding to each test case. Since the loop does not modify any variables outside of its scope and the initial state of `t`, `n`, and `k` are not altered by the loop, the output state will simply be the sequence of printed results.

Given that the loop prints the results directly and does not store them, the output state can be described as a series of printed lists for each test case.

Output State: **a series of printed lists for each test case, where each list is determined by the conditions on `n` and `k` for that test case.**
