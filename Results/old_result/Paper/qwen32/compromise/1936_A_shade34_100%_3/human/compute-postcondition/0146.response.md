In this task, the loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's continuation. The number of iterations is determined by the value of `int(input())`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `n` is an integer greater than 1
- `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received
- `mak` is the highest index `i` in `pans` (from index 1 to the end) for which the input response was `'>'`, or 0 if no such response was received
- `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='`

None of these variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, `mak`, `pans`) directly influence the loop's continuation since they are not part of the loop head. The loop will continue based on the number of times specified by `int(input())`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration does not require adjustments to `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `mak`, or `pans` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, `mak` is the highest index `i` in `pans` (from index 1 to the end) for which the input response was `'>'`, or 0 if no such response was received, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='`**
