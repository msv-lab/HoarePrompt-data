To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

- `t`: An integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `n`: An integer greater than 1.
- `mak2`: The highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received.
- `mak`: Set to 4 if the input was `'<'`, otherwise it remains 0.
- `pans`: A list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='`.
- `i`: Incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

We need to determine the values of `mak` and `i` at the time of execution.

### Analysis:
1. **`mak`**: This variable is set to 4 if the input was `'<'`. If the input was not `'<'`, `mak` remains 0. Since there's no specific information about the input being `'<'`, we assume the worst-case scenario where `mak` could be either 0 or 4. However, without additional context, we consider the general case where `mak` could be 0 (if no `'<'` input was received).

2. **`i`**: This variable is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. Since `i` is not explicitly initialized in the initial state, we assume `i` starts from 1 (as it is common for loop counters to start from 1). After the first iteration, `i` would be 2, after the second iteration, `i` would be 3, and so on.

### Conclusion:
Without specific details about the inputs and iterations, we can only provide a general answer. Assuming `mak` remains 0 (no `'<'` input received) and `i` is 1 (start of the first iteration):

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**

However, since the exact value of `mak` and `i` can vary based on the input and iterations, we should consider the general form:

Output: **? [mak] [mak] [i] [i] (where [mak] is 4 if the input was '<', otherwise 0, and [i] is the current iteration index starting from 1)**

Given the lack of specific input details, the most precise description we can provide is:

Output: **? [mak] [mak] [i] [i] (where [mak] is 4 if the input was '<', otherwise 0, and [i] is the current iteration index starting from 1)**

For simplicity and based on the typical initial conditions, if no specific input is given, we can assume `mak` is 0 and `i` is 1:

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
