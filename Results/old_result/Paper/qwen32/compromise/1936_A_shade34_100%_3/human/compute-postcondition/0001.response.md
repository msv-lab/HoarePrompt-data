The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. This means that `n` will take on the integer value provided by the user input. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and for each test case, `n` is an integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\). After executing the code, `n` will be updated to the user-provided integer value, while `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), and `n` is the integer value provided by the user input.**
