Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the string input by the user, `pans` now includes the current value of `i`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `i` remains incremented by 1 from its previous value. The condition that `n` is greater than 0 still holds. The string `s` remains the same as the input by the user. The list `pans` now contains the current value of `i` appended to it.
