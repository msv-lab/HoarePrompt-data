The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value such that \(1 \leq i < n\). For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Since `mak` is determined based on the input string and does not appear in the loop head, it should remain unchanged.

Given these points, let's adjust the state:

- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value \(k\) such that \(1 \leq k < n\).
- For the next iteration, `i` should be \(k + 1\).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is `i` if the input string is `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `i` is \(k + 1\)**

However, since we don't know the exact value of `k`, we can generalize it to say that `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. Thus, the most accurate state representation without knowing the exact previous `i` value is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is `i` if the input string is `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

For simplicity and adherence to the format, we can represent it as:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is `i` if the input string is `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `i` is incremented by 1**

But to be more precise in the context of the loop:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is `i` if the input string is `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**.

So, if we assume the previous `i` was `k`, then:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is `i` if the input string is `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `i` is \(k + 1\)**

Since we don't have the exact `k`, we can just say:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is `i` if the input string is `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `i` is incremented by 1**

Thus, the final answer is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is `i` if the input string is `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `i` is incremented by 1**
