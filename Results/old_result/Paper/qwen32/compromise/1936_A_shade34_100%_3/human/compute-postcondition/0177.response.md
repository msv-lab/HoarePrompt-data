The given code snippet appends the variable `i` to the list `pans`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state. Since `i` is not provided, we cannot determine its exact value. We can only state that `pans` will now contain one additional element, which is `i`.

Given that `pans` was initially an empty list, after executing the code, `pans` will be a list containing one element, `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, `mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, and `pans` is a list containing the value `i`; `s` is the input string and `s` is equal to `'='`.**
