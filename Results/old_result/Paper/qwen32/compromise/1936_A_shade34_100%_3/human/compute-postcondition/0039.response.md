Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is `i`, `mak2` is equal to the previous value of `mak`, `pans` is `[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `s` is the string input.**

Explanation: The value of `pans` is updated to be a list containing the current value of `i`. All other variables retain their previous values except for `pans`, which now holds the new list `[i]`.
