Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input was `'='`, and possibly the last index `i` for which the input was `'<'`. If the input was `'<'`, `mak` is now equal to `i`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0. `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.**
