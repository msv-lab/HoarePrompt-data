The code snippet sets `mak` to 0. This means that the value of `mak` is explicitly updated to 0, regardless of its previous value. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, and `pans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is the integer value provided by the user input; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input was `'='`, and possibly the last index `i` for which the input was `'<'`; `mak` is 0.**
