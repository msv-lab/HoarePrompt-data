Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received.
- `mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received.
- `pans` is an empty list.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `mak` and `mak2`:**
   - Both `mak` and `mak2` are described as the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received.
   - Since there is no additional information about any inputs being received, we assume that no such input was received.
   - Therefore, both `mak` and `mak2` will be 0.

2. **Variable `i`:**
   - The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state.
   - Since `i` is not initialized or assigned any value, it would typically result in a `NameError` if the code were to run as-is.
   - However, since the task is to determine what will be printed based on the given information, and assuming there might be a context where `i` is defined but not provided here, we cannot definitively determine the value of `i`.
   - For the sake of this task, we'll assume that `i` is not defined and thus cannot be printed without causing an error. However, since the question asks us to describe the output based on the given information, we'll treat `i` as an undefined variable.

Given the above analysis, the print statement will attempt to print `?`, `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` again. Since `mak` and `mak2` are both 0, and `i` is undefined, the output will reflect that `mak` and `mak2` are 0, and `i` will cause an error if the code were to execute. However, based on the given information:

Output: **? 0 0 i 0 (where i is undefined)**

Since the task requires a precise description based on the given information and `i` is not defined, we can only describe `mak` and `mak2` accurately.

Output: **? 0 0 [undefined] 0**
