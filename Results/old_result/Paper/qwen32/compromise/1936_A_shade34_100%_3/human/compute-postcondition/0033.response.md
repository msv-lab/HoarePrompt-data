Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `i` if `s` is `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `pans` is `[i]` if `s` is `'<'`, or a list containing the value of `i` if `s` was `'='`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list.**
