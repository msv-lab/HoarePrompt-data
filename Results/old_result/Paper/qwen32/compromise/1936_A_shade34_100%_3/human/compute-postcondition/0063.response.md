The code assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. Given that `i` is 2, `mak` will now hold the value 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing at least two elements, `mak` is 2, `i` is 2**.
