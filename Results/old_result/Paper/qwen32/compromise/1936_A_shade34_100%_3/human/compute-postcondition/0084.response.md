The given Python code snippet includes a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all output is written to the standard output immediately. However, this operation does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `pans`, `mak`, or `i`.

Since none of the variables are modified in the provided code snippet, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input was `'='`, and possibly the last index `i` for which the input was `'<'`; `mak` is set to `i` if the current input is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0; `i` is `i + 1`.**
