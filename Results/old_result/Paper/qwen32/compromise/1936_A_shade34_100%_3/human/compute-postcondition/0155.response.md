To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received.
- `mak` is `i` if the input was `'<'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0.
- `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='`.

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration. The variable `n` does not change within the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, say `k`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

The other variables (`t`, `mak2`, `mak`, and `pans`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted based on the loop's iteration logic.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, `mak` is `i` if the input was `'<'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='`, `i` is `previous_i + 1`**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we express it as `previous_i + 1`. If we assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` becomes `k + 1`.

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, `mak` is `i` if the input was `'<'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='`, `i` is 4** (assuming `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration).

However, since we do not have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, the most accurate way to express the state is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, `mak` is `i` if the input was `'<'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='`, `i` is `previous_i + 1`**. 

For the sake of providing a concrete example, let's assume `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, so:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, `mak` is `i` if the input was `'<'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='`, `i` is 4**.
