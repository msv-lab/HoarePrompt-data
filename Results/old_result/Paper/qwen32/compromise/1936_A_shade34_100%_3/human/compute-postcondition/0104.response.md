The code snippet `pans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `i`, we cannot determine the exact value being appended. However, we know that `pans` was initially an empty list and now contains one element, which is `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `pans` is a list containing one element `i`; `mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `s` is the input string, and `s` is equal to `'='`**.
