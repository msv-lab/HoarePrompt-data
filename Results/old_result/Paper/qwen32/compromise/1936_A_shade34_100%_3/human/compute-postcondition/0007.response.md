The given code snippet assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state. Since `i` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, we will represent the new value of `mak` as `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is `i`, and the input string is `'<'`.**
