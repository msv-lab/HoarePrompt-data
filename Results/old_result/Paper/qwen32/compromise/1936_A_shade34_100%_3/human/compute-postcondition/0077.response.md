Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `mak2` is initialized to 0.
- `pans` is a list that contains all indices `i` for which the input was `'='`, and possibly the last index `i` for which the input was `'<'`.
- `mak` is initialized to 0.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement outputs a string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak`, `i`, and `i`.
- From the initial state, we know that `mak` is explicitly set to 0.
- The variable `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, based on the context, it seems that `i` is likely an index related to the list `pans`. Since `pans` contains indices from the input, `i` could be one of those indices.
- Given the lack of specific information about the value of `i`, we can only say that `i` is an index from the list `pans`.

### Conclusion:
- The first two values after `'?'` are both `mak`, which is 0.
- The last two values are both `i`, which is an index from the list `pans`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is an index from the list pans)**
