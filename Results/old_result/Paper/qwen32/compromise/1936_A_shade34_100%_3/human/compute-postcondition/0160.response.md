To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (exclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, and `n` is greater than 1.

From the loop statement `for i in range(1, n):`, we know that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

No other variables (`t`, `mak2`, `mak`, `pans`) are part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted based on the loop statement alone.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k` (where `1 <= k < n`). At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize that `i` should be incremented by 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, `mak` is 4 if the input was `'<'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**

If we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `k`, then at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, `mak` is 4 if the input was `'<'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='`. `i` is \(k + 1\).**

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we can simply say that `i` is incremented by 1:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, `mak` is 4 if the input was `'<'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**

For simplicity, if we assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, `mak` is 4 if the input was `'<'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='`. `i` is \(k + 1\).**

Given that `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration (as an example):
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, `mak` is 4 if the input was `'<'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='`. `i` is 4.**

However, without the specific value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, the most accurate general answer is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, `mak` is 4 if the input was `'<'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
