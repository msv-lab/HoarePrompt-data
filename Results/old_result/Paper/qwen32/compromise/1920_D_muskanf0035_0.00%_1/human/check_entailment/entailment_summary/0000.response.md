### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code functions and their behavior in the context of the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`:
This function is responsible for processing the operations to build the array `a` and then answering the queries based on the final state of the array.

- **Operations Processing**:
  - For `b = 1`, it appends the integer `x` to the end of the array `a`.
  - For `b = 2`, it appends `x` copies of the current array `a` to the end of `a`. However, the current implementation incorrectly duplicates the array `x` times by extending it with itself `x` times, which is not what the problem statement requires. The correct approach would be to extend the array by the current array repeated `x` times, but the current implementation only extends it by itself, which is equivalent to `x=2`.
  
- **Queries**:
  - For each query `k`, it returns the element at position `k-1` in the array `a` (since Python uses 0-based indexing). If `k` is greater than the length of the array, the modulo operation ensures it wraps around the array, which is the correct behavior.

#### Function `func_2`:
This function reads the input for multiple test cases, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

- **Input Reading**:
  - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`.
  - It then reads the `n` operations and `q` queries.
  - It calls `func_1` with the operations and queries and prints the results.

### Issue:
The critical issue lies in the implementation of the second type of operation (`b = 2`). The current implementation in `func_1` does not correctly handle the operation of appending `x` copies of the current array to the end of the array. Instead, it only appends the array to itself once, which is equivalent to `x=2`.

### Correctness:
Given the incorrect handling of the second type of operation, the program does not correctly build the array `a` as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
