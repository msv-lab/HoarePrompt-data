Reasoning: 

Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `array` and a list `result` to store the answers to the queries.
   
2. **Processing Operations**:
   - The program iterates through each operation. 
   - If the operation type `op_type` is 1, it appends the value `value` to the `array`.
   - If the operation type `op_type` is 2, it attempts to extend the `array` by duplicating its current contents `value` times. However, the code provided does not actually duplicate the array `value` times but instead duplicates it only once. This is a critical error in the program as it does not correctly implement the second type of operation as described in the problem statement.

3. **Answering Queries**:
   - The program then processes each query. For each query `k`, it calculates the `(k - 1) % len(array)` index and appends the element at that index to the `result` list. This part of the code is correct assuming the `array` has been constructed correctly according to the problem statement.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

Given the analysis, the primary issue lies in the implementation of the second type of operation. The code does not correctly handle the operation of appending `x` copies of the array to itself. Instead, it only appends the array once to itself, which results in incorrect array constructions and, consequently, incorrect answers to the queries.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
