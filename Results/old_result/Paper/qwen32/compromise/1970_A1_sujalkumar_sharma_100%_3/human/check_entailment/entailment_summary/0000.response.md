### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to perform a balanced shuffle operation on a balanced parentheses sequence. The operation involves creating a table of prefix balances for each character in the sequence, sorting these entries based on specific criteria (increasing order of prefix balance and decreasing order of position for ties), and then forming a new sequence from the sorted characters.

Let's break down the provided program to see if it correctly implements this operation:

1. **Prefix Balance Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a `balance` variable to 0.
   - It iterates through the input string `s`, appending a tuple `(balance, i, s[i])` to the `prefix_balance` list for each character.
   - The `balance` is incremented by 1 for each '(', and decremented by 1 for each ')'.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the `prefix_balance` list using a lambda function as the key.
   - The lambda function sorts primarily by the prefix balance (`x[0]`), and in case of ties, by the negative position (`-x[1]`), which ensures that higher positions come first (since we are sorting in ascending order).

3. **Result Construction**:
   - After sorting, the program constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `prefix_balance` list.

### Verification Against the Example:

Given the example input `(()(()))`:

- **Prefix Balance Calculation**:
  - `Prefix balance`: 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1
  - `Position`: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
  - `Character`: (, (, ), (, (, ), ), )

- **Sorting**:
  - Sorted by prefix balance and position:
    - `Prefix balance`: 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3
    - `Position`: 1, 8, 4, 2, 7, 5, 3, 6
    - `Character`: (, ), (, (, ), (, ), )

- **Result**:
  - The characters in the sorted order form the string `()(()())`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. The execution summary confirms that the function `func_1` performs the required steps accurately.

**Correctness: True**
