    #State: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; n is the length of s; prefix_balance is a list of tuples (balance_before, index, character) for each character in s; balance is 0.

    #The program returns a string `result` which is a balanced parentheses sequence formed by joining the characters from `prefix_balance` in the specified order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence `s` as input and returns a new balanced parentheses sequence formed by rearranging the characters in `s` based on their balance and index values.
