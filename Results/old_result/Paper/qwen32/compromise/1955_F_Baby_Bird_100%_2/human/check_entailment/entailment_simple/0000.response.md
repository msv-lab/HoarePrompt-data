To determine the correctness of the given program, let's break down the problem and analyze the provided solution.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Determine the maximum number of times Bob can win, given that Bob wins if the XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
2. **Constraints**: Each number in the sequence is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. The XOR of a sequence is zero if the number of 1s, 3s, and the parity of the number of 2s and 4s (both even or both odd) result in a zero XOR.
3. **Eve's Role**: Eve removes one number at a time to maximize Bob's wins.

### Insights:
- **XOR Properties**:
  - XOR of 1 and 1 is 0.
  - XOR of 3 and 3 is 0.
  - XOR of 2 and 2 is 0.
  - XOR of 4 and 4 is 0.
  - XOR of 1 and 3 is 2.
  - XOR of 1 and 2 is 3.
  - XOR of 1 and 4 is 5 (which is 1 in binary, so it doesn't contribute to a zero XOR).
  - XOR of 2 and 3 is 1.
  - XOR of 2 and 4 is 6 (which is 2 in binary, so it doesn't contribute to a zero XOR).
  - XOR of 3 and 4 is 7 (which is 3 in binary, so it doesn't contribute to a zero XOR).
- **Strategy for Bob to Win**:
  - Bob wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
  - To achieve this, Eve should aim to remove numbers in such a way that the parity of 1s and 3s and the parity of 2s and 4s are balanced.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by considering the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence. The formula used in the program is:
```python
sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3
```
Let's break down this formula:
- `x // 2` calculates the number of pairs of each number (1s, 2s, 3s, 4s). Each pair can be removed without affecting the XOR result.
- `x % 2` checks if there is an odd number of any of these numbers. If there is, and the number is either 1 or 3 (`i < 3`), it contributes to the possibility of achieving a zero XOR.
- `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)` calculates the potential contributions to achieving a zero XOR.
- Finally, dividing by 3 gives the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by considering the optimal removal strategy of Eve. The formula used effectively calculates the number of pairs and the odd counts of 1s and 3s, which are crucial for achieving a zero XOR.

**Correctness: True**
