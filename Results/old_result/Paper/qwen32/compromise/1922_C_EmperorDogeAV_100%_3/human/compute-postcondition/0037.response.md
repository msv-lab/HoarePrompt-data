Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `cities`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` representing the number of cities and a list of `n` integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order. The function also accepts an integer `n` (though this seems redundant as `n` is already part of the `cities` tuple). For each city (excluding the first and last), the function determines whether the closest city is the one immediately before or after it in the list. If the closest city is the one after, it appends `1` to the result list `prog_cities`. Otherwise, it appends the absolute difference between the city and the closest city before it. The function returns `prog_cities`, a list of `n - 1` integers representing these determinations for each city.**
