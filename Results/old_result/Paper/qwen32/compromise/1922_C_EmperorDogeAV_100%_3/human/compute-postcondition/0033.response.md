The code modifies the value of `prog_cities[i]` by setting it to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`. The values of `i`, `back`, `forward`, and `cities` remain unchanged except for `prog_cities[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1. If `i` is greater than 0, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `back` remains -99999999999999999999. If `i < n - 1`, `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `forward` remains 999999999999999999. `prog_cities[i]` is set to `abs(forward - cities[i])`.**

In natural language: The value of `prog_cities[i]` is updated to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`. All other variables retain their initial values or states.
