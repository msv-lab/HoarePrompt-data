Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1. If `i` is greater than 0, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `back` remains -99999999999999999999. If `i < n - 1`, `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `forward` remains 999999999999999999`. If `abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back)`, then `prog_cities[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is set to `abs(forward - cities[i])`.**
