#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of cities, and the second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order. Additionally, there are m queries (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5), each represented as a tuple of two integers (x_i, y_i) (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i) indicating the cities between which the minimum travel cost is to be calculated. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each city, the closest city is uniquely determined.
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        
        forward = 999999999999999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    #State: `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` integers where the `i`-th element is `1` if the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`, otherwise the `i`-th element is `abs(forward - cities[i])`.
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns `prog_cities`, which is a list of `n - 1` integers. Each `i`-th element in `prog_cities` is `1` if the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`. Otherwise, the `i`-th element is `abs(forward - cities[i])`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of city coordinates and determines for each city (except the first and last) whether the closest city is the one immediately after it. If it is, the function records `1` in the result list; otherwise, it records the absolute difference between the city and the closest city before it. The function returns this list of `n - 1` integers.
