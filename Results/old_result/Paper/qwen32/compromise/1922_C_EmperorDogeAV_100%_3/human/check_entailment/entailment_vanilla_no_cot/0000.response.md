Correctness: **False**

The given program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Closest Cities**: The `func_1` function is supposed to determine the closest city for each city and return the cost to travel to that closest city. However, the logic within `func_1` is flawed:
   - The comparison `if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back)` is used to determine whether the closest city is forward or backward. However, the `prog_cities` array is populated with `1` if the closest city is forward and the distance otherwise. This is incorrect because:
     - The problem requires that each city has a unique closest city. The given logic does not guarantee this.
     - The function should return `1` when the closest city is forward or backward, not the distance.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Prefix Sums**: The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are calculated based on the values returned by `func_1`. Given the incorrect logic in `func_1`, these prefix sums are also incorrect.

3. **Incorrect Query Handling**: The program calculates the cost of a query by subtracting prefix sums. This logic assumes that the prefix sums correctly represent the minimum cost to travel from one city to another using the closest city strategy. Since the prefix sums are incorrect, the results of the queries are also incorrect.

To fix these issues, the program needs to correctly determine the closest city for each city and ensure that the closest city is unique for each city. Then, the prefix sums should be calculated based on the correct closest city information. Finally, the query handling logic should correctly use these prefix sums to compute the minimum cost for each query.
