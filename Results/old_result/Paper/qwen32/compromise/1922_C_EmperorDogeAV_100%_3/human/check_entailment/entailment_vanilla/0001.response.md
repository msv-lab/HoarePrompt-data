Let's examine the program step by step to verify its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the list of city coordinates `cities`, and the number of queries `m`.
   - It also reads the queries themselves.

2. **Finding Closest Cities:**
   - The function `func_1` is called twice:
     - Once with the list of cities in their original order to determine the closest city for each city when moving forward.
     - Once with the list of cities in reverse order to determine the closest city for each city when moving backward.
   - Inside `func_1`, for each city, it determines the closest city by comparing the distance to the next city and the previous city.
   - If the next city is closer, it sets the value to `1` (indicating a move to the closest city costs 1 coin). Otherwise, it sets the value to the distance to the next city.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for the forward and backward closest city costs.
   - This allows for efficient calculation of the total cost to move from one city to another using the closest city strategy.

4. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query, it calculates the minimum cost to travel from city `a` to city `b`:
     - If `a < b`, it uses the forward prefix sums.
     - If `a > b`, it uses the backward prefix sums.
   - The cost is calculated as the difference in prefix sums between the two cities.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Closest City Costs:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly compute the closest city costs. It sets the cost to `1` only when the next city is closer, but it should set the cost to `1` for moving to the closest city regardless of whether it's the next or previous city.
   - The cost should be `1` if the closest city is the next city or the previous city, and the distance otherwise.

2. **Off-by-One Errors:**
   - The prefix sums are calculated incorrectly. The prefix sums should be calculated based on the correct closest city costs, not the incorrect values computed by `func_1`.

3. **Reverse Logic for Backward Costs:**
   - The backward costs are calculated by reversing the list of cities and then reversing the prefix sums, which is incorrect. The backward costs should be calculated directly from the reversed list of cities without reversing the prefix sums again.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified in the handling of closest city costs and prefix sums, the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of coins needed to travel between cities.

**Correctness: False**
