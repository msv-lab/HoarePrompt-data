Let's break down the problem and the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding
The task is to determine the minimum number of coins required to travel between two cities, given that there are two types of moves:
1. Travel to the closest city for 1 coin.
2. Travel to any other city for the distance between the cities in coins.

### Program Analysis
The program aims to preprocess the data to efficiently answer multiple queries. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case:
     - The number of cities `n` is read.
     - The positions of the cities are read and stored in a list `cities`.
     - The number of queries `m` is read.
     - Each query is read and processed.

2. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is called twice:
     - Once with the original list of cities to calculate the closest city going forward.
     - Once with the reversed list of cities to calculate the closest city going backward.
   - The function `func_1` calculates the cost to move to the closest city for each city.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - Two prefix sum arrays, `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`, are created to store the cumulative costs of moving to the closest city forward and backward, respectively.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program determines the direction of travel (forward or backward) and calculates the cost using the prefix sum arrays.

### Issues in the Program
Let's identify the issues in the provided code:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function is supposed to calculate the cost to move to the closest city for each city.
   - The loop in `func_1` iterates from `0` to `n-1`. However, the logic inside the loop is incorrect:
     - The `forward` variable is set to the next city, but the condition `if i < n - 1` is redundant because the loop already ensures `i < n-1`.
     - The `back` variable is set to the previous city, but the condition `if i > 0` is redundant because the loop already ensures `i > 0`.
     - The condition `if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back)` is incorrect. It should be checking the closest city, not just the forward and backward cities. The problem states that the closest city is unique, so the logic should be comparing the distances to the closest city, not just the forward and backward cities.
   - The return value of `func_1` is incorrect. It should return the closest city indices, not the distances.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The prefix sum arrays `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are calculated based on the incorrect values returned by `func_1`.
   - The prefix sum arrays are used to calculate the cost for each query, but the values in the prefix sum arrays are incorrect due to the incorrect values returned by `func_1`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - The query processing logic is correct in terms of using the prefix sum arrays, but the values in the prefix sum arrays are incorrect due to the issues in `func_1`.

### Conclusion
The program is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the closest city indices, and the prefix sum arrays are calculated based on incorrect values. Therefore, the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of coins required to travel between the cities.

**Correctness: False**
