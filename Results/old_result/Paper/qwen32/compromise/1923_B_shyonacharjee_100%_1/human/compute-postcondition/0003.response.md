The code reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The list `a` is now a list of integers of length `n` as per the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers of length `n` read from the input.**
