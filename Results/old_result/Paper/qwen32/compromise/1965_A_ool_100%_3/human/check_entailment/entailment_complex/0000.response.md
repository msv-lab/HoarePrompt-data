Reasoning:  
The logic in the provided code does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules described. The game is essentially a variant of the Nim game, where the key to determining the winner lies in the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). In this specific game, the winning strategy is determined by the number of piles with a specific property, but the current implementation incorrectly interprets this property.

The function `func_1` incorrectly assumes that the winner can be determined by checking the sorted unique values of the pile sizes and their consecutive nature. Specifically, it checks if the smallest pile size is 1 and if the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are all 1, which is not the correct approach to solve this problem.

The correct approach to determine the winner is to count the number of piles with an odd number of stones. If this count is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. This is because each move reduces the number of piles with an odd number of stones by an even number, and the player who faces a situation with zero piles with an odd number of stones will lose.

Given the incorrect logic in `func_1`, the program will not always produce the correct output.

Correctness: **False**
