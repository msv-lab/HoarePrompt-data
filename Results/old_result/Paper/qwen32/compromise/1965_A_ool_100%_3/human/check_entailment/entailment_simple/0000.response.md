### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to determine the winner of the game based on the initial configuration of the piles of stones. The game is a variant of the Nim game, and the winning strategy can be determined by analyzing the sorted unique pile sizes.

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of stones in each pile `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1(arr)`:**
   - The function aims to determine the winner based on the sorted unique pile sizes.
   - It first converts the list of stones into a set to remove duplicates and then sorts this set.
   - If the smallest pile size is not 1, it returns 'Alice' immediately. This is incorrect because the game rules and Nim theory suggest that the game's outcome depends on the parity of the number of piles and the differences between sorted unique pile sizes, not solely on the smallest pile size.
   - If the smallest pile size is 1, it checks if the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are all 1 or less.
   - If all consecutive differences are 1 or less, it toggles the boolean `A` based on the count of unique pile sizes.
   - If any difference is greater than 1, it sets `not_c` to False and breaks out of the loop.
   - Finally, it toggles `A` again if `not_c` is True and returns 'Alice' if `A` is True, otherwise 'Bob'.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Initial Check:** The check `if (set_[0] != 1): return 'Alice'` is incorrect. The game's outcome does not depend solely on whether the smallest pile size is 1. It depends on the overall configuration of the piles.
- **Logic for Determining the Winner:** The logic for determining the winner based on the sorted unique pile sizes and their differences is incorrect. The correct approach involves using the Grundy number (Nim-sum) for each pile size, but the provided code does not implement this correctly.

### Correctness:
Given the issues described above, the program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the provided problem description and examples.

**Correctness: False**
