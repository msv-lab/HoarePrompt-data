Let's analyze the provided code and the problem statement step by step to determine if the given program is correct.

### Problem Understanding:
- The goal is to make a binary string `s` sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on any substring. Each cyclic shift operation on a substring of length `r-l+1` incurs a cost equal to `r-l+1`.
- The task is to find the minimum total cost to achieve this for multiple test cases.

### Code Analysis:
- The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_1` is intended to compute the minimum cost for a single binary string.
- `func_2` handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Issues in `func_1`:
1. **Input Handling**: The line `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` is incorrect for reading a binary string. `input().split()` splits the input by whitespace, which is not appropriate for reading a string without spaces. Instead, it should be `s = list(map(int, input().strip()))` to read a line and convert each character to an integer.
2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**: The logic in `func_1` is flawed. The current implementation simply counts the number of 1s encountered before a 0 and adds `n+1` to the answer, where `n` is the count of 1s. This does not correctly simulate the cost of cyclic shifts required to sort the string.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to determine the minimum cost to sort the string by cyclic shifts. Here is a high-level outline of the correct approach:
1. Traverse the string and identify segments of 1s and 0s.
2. Calculate the cost of converting each segment into a sorted sequence by cyclic shifts.
3. Sum up the costs for all segments.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the required logic to compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
