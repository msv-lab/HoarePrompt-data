You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

    #State: s is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, n is 0, ans is 9.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: 9

def func_2():
    t = int(input())

    #State: `t` is unchanged from the initial input integer.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code and the problem statement step by step to determine if the given program is correct.

### Problem Understanding:
- The goal is to make a binary string `s` sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on any substring. Each cyclic shift operation on a substring of length `r-l+1` incurs a cost equal to `r-l+1`.
- The task is to find the minimum total cost to achieve this for multiple test cases.

### Code Analysis:
- The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_1` is intended to compute the minimum cost for a single binary string.
- `func_2` handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Issues in `func_1`:
1. **Input Handling**: The line `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` is incorrect for reading a binary string. `input().split()` splits the input by whitespace, which is not appropriate for reading a string without spaces. Instead, it should be `s = list(map(int, input().strip()))` to read a line and convert each character to an integer.
2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**: The logic in `func_1` is flawed. The current implementation simply counts the number of 1s encountered before a 0 and adds `n+1` to the answer, where `n` is the count of 1s. This does not correctly simulate the cost of cyclic shifts required to sort the string.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to determine the minimum cost to sort the string by cyclic shifts. Here is a high-level outline of the correct approach:
1. Traverse the string and identify segments of 1s and 0s.
2. Calculate the cost of converting each segment into a sorted sequence by cyclic shifts.
3. Sum up the costs for all segments.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the required logic to compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
