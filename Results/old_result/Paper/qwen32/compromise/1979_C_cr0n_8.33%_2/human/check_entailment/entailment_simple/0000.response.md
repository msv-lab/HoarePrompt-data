Reasoning:
The provided program is attempting to solve the problem by calculating a set of bets such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. The program calculates the product of all multipliers and then determines the bets based on the product divided by each multiplier. However, the logic implemented in the program is flawed.

The key issue lies in the calculation of `den` (denominator). The program calculates `den` as `prod - sum(vprod)`, which is intended to ensure that the total bets are less than the amount received back for each winning outcome. However, this approach does not guarantee that the total bets will be less than the amount received back for each outcome. Instead, it should ensure that for each outcome `i`, the sum of all bets except the bet on outcome `i` is less than `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the bet on outcome `i`.

The correct approach would be to set each bet `x_i` to 1 and then check if the sum of all bets (which is `n`) is less than `k_i` for each `i`. If this condition is not met for any `i`, it means that it's impossible to distribute the bets as required, and the program should output `-1`. If the condition is met for all `i`, the program can output `1` for each bet.

Given the annotated program, it does not correctly implement the logic to ensure that the total bets are strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
