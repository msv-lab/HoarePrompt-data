Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding
The task is to distribute a certain number of coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. If such a distribution is possible, the program should output the distribution; otherwise, it should output `-1`.

### Program Analysis
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i`.

2. **Calculating the Product:**
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers `prod = k_1 * k_2 * ... * k_n`.

3. **Calculating `vprod`:**
   - For each multiplier `k_i`, it calculates `vprod[i] = prod // k_i`, which is the product of all multipliers except `k_i`.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - It calculates `den = prod - sum(vprod)`.
   - If `den <= 0`, it prints `-1`, indicating that it's not possible to distribute the coins as required.

5. **Printing the Result:**
   - If `den > 0`, it prints the values in `vprod`.

### Verification of Logic
The logic of the program is based on the following idea:
- The sum of `vprod` represents the total amount bet if we distribute the coins as `vprod`.
- For each outcome, the amount received back is `k_i * vprod[i] = prod`.
- To ensure that the total bet (`sum(vprod)`) is less than the amount received back for each outcome, we need `prod > sum(vprod)`.
- This condition is equivalent to `prod - sum(vprod) > 0`, which is checked by the program.

### Edge Cases
- **All `k_i` are equal:** In this case, `prod - sum(vprod)` will be `0`, and the program correctly outputs `-1`.
- **`k_i` values vary:** The program ensures that the distribution is feasible by checking if `prod - sum(vprod) > 0`.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the distribution of coins and handles the edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Final Answer
Reasoning: The program correctly calculates the distribution of coins and checks the feasibility of the distribution based on the given multipliers.
Correctness: **True**
