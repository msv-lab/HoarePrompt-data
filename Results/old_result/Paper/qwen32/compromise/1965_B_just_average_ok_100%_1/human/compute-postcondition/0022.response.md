To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(nums))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the `nums` list.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input.
- `nums` is a list constructed with specific elements:
  - It starts with the powers of 2 up to \(2^{20} = 1048576\).
  - It includes `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
  - The element `1 << idx` (which is \(2^{idx}\)) is removed from the list.
- `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such element exists.

### Construction of `nums`:
1. **Powers of 2**: The list initially contains the following powers of 2: 
   \[
   [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]
   \]
   This gives us 21 elements.

2. **Additional Elements**:
   - `k - nums[idx]`: This depends on the value of `k` and `nums[idx]`.
   - `k + 1`: This is simply `k` incremented by 1.
   - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This is `k` plus the value of `nums[idx]` plus 1.

3. **Removal of `1 << idx`**:
   - The element `1 << idx` (which is \(2^{idx}\)) is removed from the list.

### Calculating the Length of `nums`:
- Initially, there are 21 elements in the list of powers of 2.
- Three additional elements (`k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, `k + nums[idx] + 1`) are added.
- One element (`1 << idx`) is removed.

Thus, the total number of elements in `nums` is:
\[ 21 + 3 - 1 = 23 \]

### Final Output:
The `print(len(nums))` statement will print the length of the `nums` list, which is 23.

Output: **23**
