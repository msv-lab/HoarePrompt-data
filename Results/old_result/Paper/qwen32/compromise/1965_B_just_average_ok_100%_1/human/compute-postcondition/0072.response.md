To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and modifies the list `nums` based on the inputs `n` and `k`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, the list `nums` is initialized with powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\).
2. **Finding `idx`**: The code finds the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`. This is stored in `idx`.
3. **Modifying `nums`**:
   - It appends `k - nums[idx]` to `nums`.
   - It appends `k + 1` to `nums`.
   - It appends `k + nums[idx] + 1` to `nums`.
   - It removes the element `1 << idx` (which is `2^idx`) from `nums`.
4. **Output**: The length of the modified `nums` list and the elements of the list are printed.

After processing all `t` test cases, the state of the variables outside the loop remains unchanged, while the loop itself processes each test case independently and prints the results.

### Final Output State

Since the loop processes each test case independently and does not maintain any state between iterations, the final output state after all iterations is simply the sequence of outputs for each test case.

**Output State: **For each of the `t` test cases, the output consists of two lines:
- The first line is the length of the modified `nums` list.
- The second line contains the elements of the modified `nums` list, separated by spaces.

This means that the final output state is a concatenation of the outputs for each individual test case.

In natural language: The final output state consists of the results of processing each test case one by one. For each test case, it outputs the length of the modified list `nums` followed by the elements of the modified list `nums`. This process repeats for all `t` test cases.
