Output State: **After all iterations, the program will have processed `t` test cases. For each test case, it will output the length of the modified list `nums` followed by the elements of `nums`. The list `nums` starts with the first 21 powers of 2 (from 2^0 to 2^20), then modifies this list based on the value of `k` by removing the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and adding three new elements: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.**

In simpler terms, for each test case, the program will print the number of elements in the modified list `nums` and then print the elements themselves. The list initially contains the first 21 powers of 2, but it gets adjusted by removing one power of 2 and adding three new numbers based on the value of `k`. This process repeats for all `t` test cases provided as input.
