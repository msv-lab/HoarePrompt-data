To determine what will be printed, let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the List `nums`:**
   - The initial list `nums` contains powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{21}\).
   - Additionally, it includes two more elements: `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - One element from this list is removed, specifically the element `2^idx`, where `idx` is the largest index `i` such that `nums[i] <= k`.

2. **Determining `idx`:**
   - `idx` is the largest index `i` such that `nums[i] <= k`.
   - If no such index exists, `idx` is `-1`.

3. **Calculating the Length of `nums`:**
   - Initially, `nums` contains 23 elements (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{21}\)).
   - Two additional elements (`k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1`) are added to `nums`.
   - Therefore, before any removal, `nums` has 25 elements.
   - Since one element is removed (`2^idx`), the final length of `nums` is 24.

Given this understanding, the `print(len(nums))` statement will output the length of the modified `nums` list, which is 24.

Output: **24**
