The code snippet assigns the value of `i - 1` to the variable `idx`. Given that the initial value of `i` is 0, the new value of `idx` will be `-1`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]; `idx` is -1; `i` is 0; `nums[i]` is greater than `k`.**
