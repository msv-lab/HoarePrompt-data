The code assigns the value of `i - 1` to the variable `idx`. Since `i` is `i + 1` from the initial state, we can infer that `idx` will be equal to the original value of `i`.

Given that `i` was incremented by 1, and now `idx` is set to `i - 1`, `idx` will hold the original value of `i` before it was incremented.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `i` is `i + 1`, `idx` is the original value of `i`**.
