Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]; `idx` is -1.**

Explanation: The value of `idx` has been explicitly set to -1 by the code snippet. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the given code.
