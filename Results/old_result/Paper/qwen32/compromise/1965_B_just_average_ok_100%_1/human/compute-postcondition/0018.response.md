The code appends a new value to the list `nums`. This new value is calculated as `k - nums[idx]`, where `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`.

Given that `nums` initially contains powers of 2 up to 1048576, and `idx` points to the largest power of 2 in `nums` that does not exceed `k`, the new element added to `nums` is the difference between `k` and this largest power of 2.

Therefore, the updated list `nums` will include this new element, while `t`, `n`, `k`, and `idx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, `k - nums[idx]`]; `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such element exists.**
