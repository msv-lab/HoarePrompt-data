To determine the output of the `print(*nums)` statement, let's break down the initial state and how the list `nums` is constructed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variables `t`, `n`, and `k`:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (though `t` does not affect the construction of `nums` directly).
   - `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input. The exact values of `n` and `k` are not specified, but `k` is used in constructing the `nums` list.

2. **List `nums`:**
   - `nums` is a predefined list of powers of 2: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`.
   - Additionally, `nums` includes two more elements: `k - nums[idx]` and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - The element `1 << idx` (which is equivalent to `2^idx`) is removed from the list, where `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`.

### Steps to Construct `nums`:

1. **Identify `idx`:**
   - `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in the predefined list that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - For example, if `k = 10`, then `idx` would be 3 because `2^3 = 8` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 10.

2. **Calculate Additional Elements:**
   - `k - nums[idx]`: Subtract the value of `2^idx` from `k`.
   - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: Add the value of `2^idx` to `k` and then add 1.

3. **Construct `nums`:**
   - Start with the predefined list of powers of 2.
   - Remove the element `2^idx`.
   - Append `k - nums[idx]` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the list.

### Example Calculation:

Let's assume `k = 10` for illustration:
- `idx` would be 3 because `2^3 = 8` is the largest power of 2 ≤ 10.
- `nums[idx]` is `8`.
- `k - nums[idx]` is `10 - 8 = 2`.
- `k + nums[idx] + 1` is `10 + 8 + 1 = 19`.

So, `nums` would be:
- Original list without `2^3` (which is 8): `[1, 2, 4, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`.
- Adding `2` and `19` to the list: `[1, 2, 4, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2, 19]`.

### General Case:

Given the above steps, the output will be the modified list `nums` after removing `2^idx` and adding `k - nums[idx]` and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.

### Final Output:

Output: **[1, 2, 4, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, k - 2^idx, k + 2^idx + 1] (where idx is the index of the largest power of 2 in the predefined list that is less than or equal to k)**
