To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which is just `i` in this case.

Here's the given information:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input.
- `nums` is a predefined list of powers of 2.
- `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
- The loop breaks if `nums[i] > k`, otherwise, it continues.

Given that the loop increments `i` by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `x`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since we know `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we can express the new state as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1**.

If we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `x`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `i` is `i + 1`**. 

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we can simply say:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1**.

Thus, the final answer is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `i` is `i + 1`**.
