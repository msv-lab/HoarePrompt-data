In the given for loop, the loop variable is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable when its value is not used within the loop body. The loop runs for a number of times specified by the integer input.

Since the loop variable `_` is not used inside the loop, it does not affect the state of the program in terms of variables like `t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, and `idx`. The loop simply iterates a certain number of times based on the input.

Given this, the only thing that needs to be considered is the number of iterations left for the loop. Since the loop variable `_` is not modified or used within the loop, the state of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, `idx`) remains unchanged from the end of the previous iteration to the start of the next iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be exactly the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, `k + nums[idx] + 1`] with the element `1 << idx` removed; `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if no such element exists.**
