Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n = len(a)`, `left` is a list containing a single element `0`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times, and `last` is a list of length `n` where each element after the first is either the index `i` where a change was observed or the last index where a change was observed.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    left.append(left[-1] + i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes and must have at least one element; `left` has an additional element which is the sum of its last element and `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes and must have at least one element; `left` has an additional element which is the sum of its last element and the current `i`, and another element which is the sum of the new last element of `left` and the next `i` from `a`. `i` is the next element in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes and must have at least one element; `i` is the next element in the list `a`; `left` has a new element appended, which is the sum of `left[-1]` and `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
