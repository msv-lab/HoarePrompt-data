The `continue` statement in the given code snippet does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there are no other changes to the variables in this snippet, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is at least 2, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0` and ending with the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times except `ans[2]` which is `1`, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element after the first is either the index `i` where a change was observed or the last index where a change was observed, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, and `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`. If `inx` is less than `0`, the values of `inx` and `inx2` remain unchanged, `i` is 2.**
