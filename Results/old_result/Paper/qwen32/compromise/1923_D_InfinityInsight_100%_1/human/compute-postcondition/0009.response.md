The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is the length of the list `a`, which is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2, and `n` remains the same (length of `a`).

State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n = len(a)` and `n >= 2`, `left` is a list containing a single element `0`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `last` is a list containing two elements `[-1, i]`. Otherwise, `last` is a list containing two elements `[-1, -1]`, `i` is 2**
