The code snippet appends the sum of the last element in the list `left` and the variable `i` to the list `left`. Therefore, the list `left` will have one more element, which is the sum of the previous last element of `left` and `i`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes and must have at least one element; `i` is the next element in the list `a`; `left` has a new element appended, which is the sum of `left[-1]` and `i`.**
