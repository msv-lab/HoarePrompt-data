Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n = len(a)` and `n >= 2`, `left` is a list containing a single element `0`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times, `i` is 3, and `last` is a list that can be either `[-1, 3, 3]` or `[-1, 2, 2]` depending on whether `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`.**
