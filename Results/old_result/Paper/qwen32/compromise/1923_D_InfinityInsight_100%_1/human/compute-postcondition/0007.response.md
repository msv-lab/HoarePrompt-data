The code snippet `last.append(last[-1])` appends the last element of the list `last` to itself. Initially, `last` is a list containing a single element `-1`. After appending the last element (`-1`) to `last`, the list `last` will contain two elements: `[-1, -1]`.

The other variables (`a`, `n`, `left`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n = len(a)` and `n >= 2`, `left` is a list containing a single element `0`, `last` is a list containing two elements `[-1, -1]`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times, and `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]`.**
