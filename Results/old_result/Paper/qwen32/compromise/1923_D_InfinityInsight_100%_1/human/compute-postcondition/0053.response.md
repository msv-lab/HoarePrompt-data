The code snippet `ans[i] = 1` modifies the list `ans` by setting the element at index `i` (which is 3) to the value `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is at least 4, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0` and ending with the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times except `ans[2]` which is `3 - inx` and `ans[3]` which is `1`, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element after the first is either the index `i` where a change was observed or the last index where a change was observed, `x` is `left[2] - a[2] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[1]`, `i` is 3**.
