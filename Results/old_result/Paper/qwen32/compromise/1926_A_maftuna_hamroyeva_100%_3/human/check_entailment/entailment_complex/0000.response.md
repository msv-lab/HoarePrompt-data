### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem as described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a loop that runs `t` times.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads a string `a` of length 5.
   - Two counters, `l` and `h`, are initialized to zero. These counters will be used to count the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', respectively.
   - The program then iterates through each character in the string `a`.
     - If the character is 'A', it increments the counter `l`.
     - Otherwise, it increments the counter `h`.

3. **Determining the Most Frequent Character:**
   - After counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string, the program compares the values of `l` and `h`.
   - If `l` (the count of 'A') is greater than `h` (the count of 'B'), it prints 'A'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'B'.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where the string consists entirely of 'A's or entirely of 'B's.
   - Since all test cases are distinct and the string length is fixed at 5, the logic ensures that the comparison between `l` and `h` will always yield the correct result.

### Conclusion:

The program accurately implements the logic required to determine the most frequent character ('A' or 'B') in each of the given strings. Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the program will produce the correct output for all valid inputs.
