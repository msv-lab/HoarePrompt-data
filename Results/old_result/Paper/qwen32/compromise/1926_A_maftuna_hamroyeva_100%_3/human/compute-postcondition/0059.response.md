The only variable in the loop head is `j`, which iterates over each character in the string `a`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `j` and how it changes during each iteration.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is either 'A' or not 'A'.
- `a` is a non-empty string.

Since `j` iterates over each character in `a`, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will take the next character in the string `a`.

Let's break down the possibilities:
- If `j` was 'A' in the previous iteration, it means the previous character in `a` was 'A'.
- If `j` was not 'A' in the previous iteration, it means the previous character in `a` was something other than 'A'.

In both cases, `j` will now hold the next character in the string `a`. The values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `l`, and `h` do not change based on the loop head, so they remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `t` remains an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive.
- `i` remains 2.
- `a` remains a non-empty string.
- `j` will be the next character in the string `a`.
- `l` and `h` will depend on the new value of `j`: if `j` is 'A', then `l` is 1 and `h` is 0; otherwise, `l` is 0 and `h` is 1.

Since we don't know the exact next character in `a`, we can only describe `j` as the next character in the string `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive; `i` is 2; `a` is a non-empty string; `j` is the next character in the string `a`; if `j` is 'A', then `l` is 1 and `h` is 0; otherwise, `l` is 0 and `h` is 1.**
