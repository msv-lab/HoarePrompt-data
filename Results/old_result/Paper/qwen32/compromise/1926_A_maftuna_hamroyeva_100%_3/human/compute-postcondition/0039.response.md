The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`, which iterates over the string `a`. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was the second character of `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should now be the third character of `a`.

No other variables in the loop head (`a`) need adjustment. The values of `t`, `i`, `l`, and `h` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive; `i` is 1; `a` is a non-empty string; `j` is the third character of `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is 2 and `h` is 0. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `h` is 2.**
