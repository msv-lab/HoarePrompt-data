The value of `h` is incremented by 1. Given the initial conditions, `h` was either 0 or 1. If `j` (the second character of `a`) is 'A', `h` was initially 0 and now becomes 1. Otherwise, if `j` is not 'A', `h` was initially 1 and now becomes 2. The values of `t`, `i`, `a`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive; `i` is 1; `a` is a non-empty string; `j` is the second character of `a`; if `j` is 'A', then `l` is 1 and `h` is 1; otherwise, `l` is 0 and `h` is 2.**
