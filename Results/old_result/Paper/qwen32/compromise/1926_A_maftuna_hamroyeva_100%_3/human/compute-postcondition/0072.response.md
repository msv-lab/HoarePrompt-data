Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive; `i` is 2; `a` is the input string; `l` is the number of 'A's in the string `a`; `h` is the number of characters in the string `a` that are not 'A'. If `l` is greater than `h`, then `l` is indeed greater than `h`. Otherwise, `l` is less than or equal to `h`.**
