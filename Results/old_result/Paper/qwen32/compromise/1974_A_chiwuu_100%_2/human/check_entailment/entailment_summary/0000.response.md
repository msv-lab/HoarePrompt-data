### Reasoning:

Let's break down the given program and see if it correctly calculates the minimal number of required screens for each test case.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads `t`, the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`.

2. **Calculation of Screens:**
   - The program first calculates the number of screens needed to accommodate all 2x2 icons. Since each screen can hold a maximum of 4 2x2 icons (as the screen is 5x3, and a 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, we can fit a maximum of 4 such icons on a screen without overlapping), the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons is `ceil(y / 4)`, which is calculated as `t = b // 2 + 1` if `b` (the number of 2x2 icons) is odd, and `t = b // 2` if `b` is even.
   
3. **Accommodating 1x1 Icons:**
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, the program calculates the remaining space available on the screens used for 2x2 icons. This is done by calculating `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`, which represents the total number of 1x1 cells available on the screens used for 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a` (the number of 1x1 icons), no additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons.
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, the program calculates how many additional screens are needed to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons. This is calculated as `t2 = a - t1`, and the number of additional screens needed is `ceil(t2 / 15)`. This is done by `t = t + t2 // 15 + 1` if `t2` is not a multiple of 15, and `t = t + t2 // 15` otherwise.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of screens needed for each test case.

### Issues:
- The logic for calculating the number of screens for 2x2 icons seems incorrect. The number of screens needed for 2x2 icons should be `ceil(y / 4)`, but the program calculates it as `b // 2 + 1` for odd `b` and `b // 2` for even `b`, which is incorrect. For example, if `y = 5`, the program calculates `t = 3`, but it should be `2` (since 5 2x2 icons can fit in 2 screens).
- The calculation of `t1` and the logic for accommodating 1x1 icons seems to be based on the incorrect assumption about the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the logic for calculating the number of screens for 2x2 icons and the subsequent calculations, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
