The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons, respectively. It then calculates and prints the minimum number of 2x2 slots needed to accommodate all the icons for each test case.
