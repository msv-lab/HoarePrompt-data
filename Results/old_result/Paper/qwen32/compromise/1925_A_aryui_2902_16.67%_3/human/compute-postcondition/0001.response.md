The code snippet assigns a string to the variable `s`. The string assigned is `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'`. This change affects the variable `s` but does not affect the other variables `t`, `n`, or `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 676; `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, where 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26; `s` is `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'`.**
