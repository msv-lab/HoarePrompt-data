The provided code snippet is:

```python
pos = -1
```

This line of code reassigns the value of the variable `pos` to `-1`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `arr`, `low`, `high`, and `st`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is -1, `low` is 0, `high` is n-1, `st` is a set used to store midpoints visited during the binary search.**
