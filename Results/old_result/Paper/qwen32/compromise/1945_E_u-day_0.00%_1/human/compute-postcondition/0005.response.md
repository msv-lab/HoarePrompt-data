Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `low` is 0, `high` is `n-1`, `st` is a set used to store midpoints visited during the binary search.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `low` to 0 and `high` to `n-1`. The values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, and `st` remain unchanged.
