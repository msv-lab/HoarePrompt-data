### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python code and compare it with the problem description to determine if it is correct.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - `func_1` reads a line of input and strips any leading/trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2` reads an integer from the input (the number of test cases).
   - `func_3` reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - `func_4` processes each test case:
     - It reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x`.
     - It initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x`.
     - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
     - Depending on the direction, it updates the set `ans` with the new possible positions of the ball after the throw:
       - If `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to the set.
       - If `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to the set.
     - After processing all throws, it checks if `0` is in the set `ans` and replaces it with `n` if necessary (since player positions are 1-indexed).

3. **Output:**
   - It prints the number of unique players who could have the ball.
   - It prints the sorted list of these player numbers.

### Correctness:

The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here are the key points that confirm its correctness:

- **Input Parsing:** The input is parsed correctly using `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.
- **Set Operations:** The use of a set `ans` to keep track of possible positions of the ball ensures that only unique positions are considered.
- **Handling Directions:** The code correctly handles both clockwise ('0'), counterclockwise ('1'), and unknown ('?') directions.
- **Modulo Operation:** The modulo operation `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` correctly handle the circular nature of the players.
- **Output:** The output is formatted correctly, with the number of possible players followed by their sorted identifiers.

### Conclusion:

The code correctly implements the problem's requirements and handles all edge cases as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
