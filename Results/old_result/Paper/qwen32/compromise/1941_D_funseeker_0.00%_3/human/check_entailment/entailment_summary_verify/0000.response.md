### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment to determine if the assessment is accurate.

**Program Analysis:**

1. **Handling of Modulo Operation:**
   - The program uses the modulo operation to determine the new position of the ball after each throw.
   - If the result of the modulo operation is `0`, it converts `0` to `n` before adding it to the set `ans`.
   - This conversion is done correctly within the loop, ensuring that `ans` always contains valid player numbers (from `1` to `n`).

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The problem constraints specify that `n` is at least `2`, and the code does not explicitly handle the edge case where `n` is `1`. However, since this edge case is not possible based on the problem statement, this is not a critical issue.

3. **Output Order:**
   - The program uses a set to store possible player numbers, which does not guarantee any order.
   - Before printing, the set `ans` is converted to a sorted list `sorted_ans` to ensure the output is in increasing order.
   - The sorted list is then printed, which satisfies the requirement of the problem description.

**Function Summary:**
- The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_4`. It determines the set of players who could potentially have the ball after a series of throws, based on the initial player and the rules for passing the ball. It prints the number of such players and their identifiers.

**Original Assessment:**
- The original assessment identifies two issues:
  1. The conversion of `0` to `n` should be done before printing.
  2. The output needs to be in increasing order.
- However, the code already handles these points correctly:
  - The conversion of `0` to `n` is done within the loop, ensuring that `ans` always contains valid player numbers.
  - The set `ans` is converted to a sorted list before printing, ensuring the output is in increasing order.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment incorrectly identifies issues that are already handled in the code. The program correctly handles the modulo operation, ensures valid player numbers, and outputs the player numbers in the required order.

**Final: **True**
