Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Handling of Modulo Operation**: When calculating the new position of the ball, the modulo operation can result in `0`. However, the problem specifies that player numbers range from `1` to `n`. Therefore, when the modulo operation results in `0`, it should be mapped to `n` instead.

2. **Discarding `0` and Adding `n`**: The program correctly identifies that a result of `0` modulo `n` should be mapped to `n`, but the logic to handle this is placed after the loop, which means it only applies to the final result set. However, it should be handled within the loop to ensure all intermediate positions are correctly mapped.

3. **Sorting the Output**: The problem requires the output player numbers to be in increasing order. The program does not sort the set before printing it.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
from functools import lru_cache

# Function 1:
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()

# Function 2:
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())

# Function 3:
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))

# Function 4:
def func_4():
    (n, m, x) = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        (r, c) = func_1().split()
        r = int(r)
        temp = set()
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                new_pos = (q + r) % n
                temp.add(n if new_pos == 0 else new_pos)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                new_pos = (q - r) % n
                temp.add(n if new_pos == 0 else new_pos)
        ans = temp
    print(len(ans))
    print(*sorted(ans))

# Main function to handle multiple test cases
def main():
    t = func_2()
    for _ in range(t):
        func_4()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This version ensures that all positions are correctly mapped and sorted before printing.
