The code snippet `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds a new value to the set `temp`. The value added is the result of `(q + r) % n`.

Given the initial state, we know that:
- `n` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `m` is still greater than 0.
- `x` and `ans` are sets containing at least one value.
- `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[0]`.
- `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[1]` and `c` is either '0' or '?'.
- `temp` is an empty set.

The value of `q` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `temp` will contain the result of the expression `(q + r) % n` after the code is executed.

Since `temp` was initially an empty set, after the execution of the code, `temp` will contain one element, which is `(q + r) % n`.

Output State: **`n` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration, `m` is still greater than 0, `x` and `ans` are sets containing at least one value, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[0]`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[1]` and `c` is either '0' or '?', and `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n`.**
