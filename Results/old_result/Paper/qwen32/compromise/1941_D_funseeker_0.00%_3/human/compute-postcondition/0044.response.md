Output State: **`n` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration, `m` is still greater than 0, `x` and `ans` are sets containing at least one value, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[0]`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[1]`, `q` is the next element in the set `ans` (after the current `q`), `temp` contains the additional element `(q - r) % n`.**

In this output state, the set `temp` has been updated to include the new element `(q - r) % n`. All other variables retain their initial states as described.
