Output State: **`n` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration, `m` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration and still greater than 0, `x` is unchanged, `ans` contains all computed values `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` based on the value of `c`, `r` is the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[0]` (now as an integer), and `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[1]` (now as a string)**

In simpler terms: The value of `r` has been converted from a string to an integer, while all other variables remain unchanged.
