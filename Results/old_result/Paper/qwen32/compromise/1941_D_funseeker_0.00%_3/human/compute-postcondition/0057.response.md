The code snippet adds the result of `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Given the initial state, the value of `temp` will now include both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.

Output State: **`n` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration, `m` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration and still greater than 0, `x` is unchanged, `ans` contains at least one element, `r` is the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[0]` (now as an integer), `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[1]` (now as a string), and `c` is either '1' or '?'. `temp` contains the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.**
