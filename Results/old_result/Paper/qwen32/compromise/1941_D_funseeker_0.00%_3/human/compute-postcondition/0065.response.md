Output State: **`n` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration, `m` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration and still greater than 0, `x` is unchanged, `ans` contains at least two elements, `r` is the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[0]` (now as an integer), `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[1]` (now as a string). `q` is the next element in `ans`. `temp` contains the element `(q + r) % n`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `temp` now includes the element `(q + r) % n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
