Output State: **`n` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration, `m` is still greater than 0, `x`, `ans` is a set containing all values `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the previous `ans` based on the value of `c`, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[0]`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[1]`, and `temp` is an empty set.**

In simple terms: The variable `temp` is now an empty set, while all other variables retain their previous values.
