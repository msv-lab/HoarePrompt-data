The code adds a new element to the set `temp`. The element added is calculated as `(q + r) % n`. Since `n`, `r`, and `q` are variables whose specific values are not provided, we can only express the new element in terms of these variables.

The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, `c`, and the fact that `temp` was initially an empty set remain unchanged except for `temp` itself, which now contains the new element.

Output State: **`n` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration, `m` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration and still greater than 0, `x` is unchanged, `ans` contains at least one element, `r` is the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[0]` (now as an integer), `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[1]` (now as a string) and `c` is either '0' or '?', `temp` contains the element `(q + r) % n`.**
