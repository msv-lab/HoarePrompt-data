Let's analyze the given program and the original assessment step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions, considering that the friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time it is chosen. The expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers, and the result is \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)\).

### Program Analysis

The provided program has the following key components:
1. **Reading Input**: It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by `m` lines of friendship pairs with their initial friendship values.
2. **Calculating Probability**: It calculates the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs (`n * (n - 1) // 2`), which is the probability of choosing any specific pair.
3. **Summing Initial Friendship Values**: It sums up the initial friendship values of all friend pairs.
4. **Calculating Expected Increase**: It attempts to calculate the expected increase in friendship values over `k` excursions.
5. **Computing Final Expected Value**: It computes the final expected value and prints it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Issues in the Program

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues in the program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Probability**: The probability `c` is calculated correctly as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs, but it is used incorrectly in the subsequent calculations.
2. **Incorrect Expected Value Calculation**: The program does not correctly calculate the expected increase in friendship values. The expected increase should consider the probability of each friend pair being chosen and the expected increase in their friendship values over `k` excursions.
3. **Incorrect Handling of Non-Friend Pairs**: The program should return 0 for cases where there are no friend pairs (`m = 0`), but the current implementation might not handle this correctly.
4. **Incorrect Use of Modular Inverse**: The modular inverse is used incorrectly in the loop that calculates `s`.

### Corrected Program

The corrected version of the program provided in the original assessment addresses these issues:
- It correctly calculates the probability of choosing any specific pair.
- It calculates the expected increase in friendship values by considering the probability of each friend pair being chosen and the expected increase in their friendship values over `k` excursions.
- It handles cases where there are no friend pairs correctly by summing the initial friendship values and the expected increase.

### Final Evaluation

Given the analysis and the corrected version provided, the original program is indeed incorrect. The original assessment accurately identifies the flaws in the program and provides a corrected version that should work as intended.

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect, and the original assessment is accurate.
