Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Here's a breakdown of the problem:

1. **Input:**
   - `n`: Number of children.
   - `m`: Number of pairs of friends.
   - `k`: Number of excursions.
   - `m` lines each containing `a_i`, `b_i`, `f_i` representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions, expressed as `p * q^-1 mod (10^9 + 7)`.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - Each pair of children can be chosen with equal probability.
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair `(a_i, b_i)` in any given excursion is `1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`.
   - The friendship value of a pair increases by 1 for every subsequent excursion if they are chosen.
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions needs to be computed.

### Program Analysis

Let's analyze the provided code line by line:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)  # This line seems incorrect
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a  # This line is incorrect
        print(s % M)
```

1. **Initialization:**
   - `M` is set to `10^9 + 7` as required.
   - `c` is supposed to be the modular inverse of the number of possible pairs, which is `1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`. However, `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)` is incorrect because `n * (n - 1) // 1` is just `n * (n - 1)`. It should be `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - `a` is the sum of all initial friendship values. This part is correct.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The loop `for i in range(k)` is intended to calculate the expected value over `k` excursions. However, the expression `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect.
   - The correct expected value calculation involves summing up the expected contributions of each pair over `k` excursions, considering their initial friendship values and the incremental increase.

### Correct Approach

The correct approach involves:
1. Calculating the expected contribution of each pair over `k` excursions.
2. Summing these contributions and computing the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Conclusion

The provided program contains incorrect logic for calculating the expected value and the modular inverse. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
