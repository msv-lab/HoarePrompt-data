To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop's behavior and how the variables change with each iteration.

The loop runs for `k` iterations, where `k` is 1000000007. The loop updates the variable `s` in each iteration according to the formula:
\[ s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a \]
where `i` starts from `m - 1` and increments by 1 in each iteration.

Let's break down the changes step-by-step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n`, `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `k` is 1000000007.
   - `M` is 1000000007.
   - `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`.
   - `s` is 0.
   - `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input.
   - `i` is `m - 1`.
   - `u`, `v`, `f` are the integers read from the input in the last iteration.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - In each iteration, `s` is updated by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to it.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration.

The loop runs for `k` iterations, so `i` will take values from `m - 1` to `m + k - 2` (which is `m + 1000000005`).

The final value of `s` will be the sum of the series:
\[ s = \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} \left( c * (m - 1 + j) * c * m + c * a \right) \]

This can be simplified as:
\[ s = c * m * c * \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} (m - 1 + j) + c * a * k \]

The sum of the arithmetic series \(\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} (m - 1 + j)\) is:
\[ \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} (m - 1 + j) = k * (m - 1) + \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} j = k * (m - 1) + \frac{(k-1) * k}{2} \]

Substituting this into the equation for `s`:
\[ s = c * m * c * \left( k * (m - 1) + \frac{(k-1) * k}{2} \right) + c * a * k \]

Since `k` is 1000000007, we can compute the final value of `s` using modular arithmetic to ensure it stays within the bounds of `M`.

**Output State:**
- `n`, `m` must be greater than 0.
- `k` is 1000000007.
- `M` is 1000000007.
- `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`.
- `s` is computed as described above.
- `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input.
- `i` is `m + k - 1` (which is `m + 1000000006`).
- `u`, `v`, `f` are the integers read from the input in the last iteration.

The final output state in the required format:

Output State: **`n`, `m` must be greater than 0; `k` is 1000000007; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`; `s` is `c * m * c * (1000000007 * (m - 1) + (1000000006 * 1000000007) // 2) + c * a * 1000000007` modulo `M`; `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input; `i` is `m + 1000000006`; `u`, `v`, `f` are the integers read from the input in the last iteration.**
