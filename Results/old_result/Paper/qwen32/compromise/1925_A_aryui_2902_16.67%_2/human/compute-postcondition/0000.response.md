The code reads a single line of input, which contains two integers separated by a space, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that the input is provided through standard input and consists of multiple test cases, but the code snippet provided only reads one test case at a time.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from standard input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 26` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 26`.**
