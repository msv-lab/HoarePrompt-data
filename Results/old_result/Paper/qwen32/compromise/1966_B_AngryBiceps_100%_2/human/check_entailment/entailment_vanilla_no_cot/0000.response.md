Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color based on the given operations. 

The program checks if the first and last rows are uniform (all squares in the row are the same color) and if the first and last columns are uniform, and if both the rows and columns are uniform but different from each other, it outputs "NO". However, this logic is not sufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made uniform.

For example, consider a grid like this:

```
W B
B W
```

According to the program's logic, the first and last rows are not uniform, and the first and last columns are not uniform, so it would output "YES". However, it is impossible to make all squares the same color with the given operations.

A correct approach would involve checking if there exists a connected component of the same color that can be expanded to cover the entire grid. This is a more complex problem that involves checking connectivity within the grid, which the provided program does not handle.
