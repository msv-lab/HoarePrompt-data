Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the specified operations. Here is an example that demonstrates a failure of the program:

Consider the following grid:
```
3 3
WWW
WBW
WWW
```
In this example, it is possible to make all squares the same color by selecting the positions (1, 1) and (3, 3) to color all squares in the subrectangle between them white. However, the provided program will output "NO" for this case.

Let's see why the program fails with this example:
- The first row is "WWW", which is all the same color.
- The last row is "WWW", which is all the same color.
- The first column is "WWW", which is all the same color.
- The last column is "WWW", which is all the same color.
- Since the first row and the last row are the same, and the first column and the last column are the same, the program will not output "NO" based on the conditions it checks. However, the program's logic is insufficient to handle cases where the grid can be made uniform by selecting other pairs of squares.

The program only checks if the first and last rows or columns are uniform and different from each other, which is not sufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made uniform. The program needs a more comprehensive approach to check the entire grid for uniformity or the possibility of making it uniform.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case and potentially other similar cases.
