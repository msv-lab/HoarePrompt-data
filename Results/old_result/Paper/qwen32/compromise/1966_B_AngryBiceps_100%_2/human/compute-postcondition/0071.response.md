Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings, `first_row` is a string containing the first characters of each of the `n` input strings concatenated in order, `last_row` is a string containing the last characters of each of the `n` input strings concatenated in order, `i` is `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is an integer between 1 and 10,000.
- `n` remains the same as it is the number of iterations the loop runs.
- `m` remains unchanged as it is the second integer from the new input.
- `a` is a list that contains all `n` input strings.
- `first_row` is a string formed by concatenating the first character of each input string in the order they were input.
- `last_row` is a string formed by concatenating the last character of each input string in the order they were input.
- `i` is `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, and after the loop, `i` holds the last value it was assigned, which is `n-1`.
