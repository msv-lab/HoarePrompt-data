The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element in the list `a` to `first_row`.

Given the initial state, `first_row` is the concatenation of its initial value and the first character of the newly appended input. After executing the code, `first_row` will be its previous value concatenated with the first character of the newly appended input again.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a list containing `input_value` and the newly appended input, `first_row` is the concatenation of its initial value and the first character of the newly appended input (twice), `last_row` is the last character of the newly appended input concatenated with the last character of the last element in the list `a`, `i` is 2**.
