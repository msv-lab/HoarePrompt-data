The code snippet modifies the `last_row` variable by appending the last character of the last element in the list `a` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing three elements which are the input values, `first_row` is the first character of the first input value concatenated with the first character of the second input value and the first character of the third input value, `last_row` is the last character of the first input value concatenated with the last character of the second input value and the last character of the third input value, `i` is 2.**
