Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements which are the input values, `first_row` is a string consisting of the first characters of each of the `n` input values concatenated together, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last characters of each of the `n` input values concatenated together, `i` is `n-1`. `first_row` consists of all identical characters, `last_row` consists of all identical characters, and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`. At least one of the following is true: the first element of `a` does not consist of all identical characters, the last element of `a` does not consist of all identical characters, or the first and last elements of `a` are the same.**
