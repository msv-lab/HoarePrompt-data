The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element in the list `a` to the current value of `first_row`. 

Given the initial state, `a` is a list containing two elements which are the input values, and `first_row` is the first character of the first input value. Let's denote the two elements in `a` as `a[0]` and `a[1]`. Thus, `a[-1]` refers to `a[1]`.

The first character of `a[1]` is `a[1][0]`, and this character is appended to `first_row`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing two elements which are the input values, `first_row` is the first character of the first input value concatenated with the first character of the second input value, `last_row` is the last character of the first input value, `i` is 1**.
