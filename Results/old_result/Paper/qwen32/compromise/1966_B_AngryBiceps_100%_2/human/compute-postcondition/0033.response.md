The code snippet `a.append(input())` appends the input value to the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Given that `a` was initially an empty list, after the execution of the code, `a` will contain one element, which is the input value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input value, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is 0**.
