The code snippet `s.append('1')` appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. 

Given that `s` initially contains either `'1'` or `'0'` for each of its 30 elements, representing the bits of the integer `x`, the new state of `s` will have 31 elements, with the last element being `'1'`.

The values of the other variables (`t`, `x`, `flag`, `nalla`, and `length`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `length` is 30, and `s` is a list containing either the string `'1'` or `'0'` for the first 30 elements and `'1'` as the 31st element. `i` is 30.**
