Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of strings where each string is either '1', '0', or '-1', `flag` is either 0 or 1, `nalla` is unchanged, `length` is greater than 1. The current element `s[i]` is '-1' and the previous element `s[i - 1]` is '1'.**
