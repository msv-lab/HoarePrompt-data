Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each being either the string `'1'` or the string `'0'` depending on whether the corresponding bit of `x` is set or not. If `flag` was 0 and `s[0]` was originally `'0'`, then `s[0]` is now `'1'`. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i] == s[i + 1] == '1'`, then `s[i]` is now `'-1'`, `flag` is set to 1, and `s[i + 1]` is `'1'`. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0 or is 1 if it was already set to 1, and either `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]` or `s[i]` is not `'1'`. `i` remains 0.**
