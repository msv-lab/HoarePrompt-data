Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `length` is 30, `s` is a list of 30 strings, where `s[0]` is `'0'` if `flag` was initially 1, or `'1'` if the 0-th bit of `x` is set, or `'0'` if the 0-th bit of `x` is not set, `s[1]` is `'0'` if `flag` was initially 1 and `s[1]` was `'0'`, otherwise `'1'`, and all other `s[j]` for `j` from 2 to 29 remain either `'1'` or `'0'`. `i` is 1.**
