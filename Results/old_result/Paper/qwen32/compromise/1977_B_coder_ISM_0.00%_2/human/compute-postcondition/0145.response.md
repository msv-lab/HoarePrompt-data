Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 31 strings where each string is either '1', '0', or '-1' and `s[30]` is now '1', `length` is 30, `flag` is 1, and `nalla` is unchanged.**

In simple terms, the list `s` has been updated to include an additional element '1' at the end, making its length 31. All other variables remain unchanged.
