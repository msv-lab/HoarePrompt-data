Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 strings where each string is either '1' or '0' depending on whether the corresponding bit (from 0 to 29) of `x` is set or not, `length` is 30, `flag` is 0, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, and `i` is 0. Additionally, `flag` is 0, `s[i]` is '1', and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]`.**
