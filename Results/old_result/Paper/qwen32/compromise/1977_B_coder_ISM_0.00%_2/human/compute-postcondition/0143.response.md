Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 strings where each string is either '1', '0', or '-1' depending on the loop's modifications, `length` is 30, `flag` is 1, and `nalla` is unchanged. Additionally, either `flag` is 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'. The current value of `flag` is 1.**
