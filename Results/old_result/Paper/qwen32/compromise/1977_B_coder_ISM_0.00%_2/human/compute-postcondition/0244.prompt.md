Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `flag` is 0 if `s[29]` is `'0'` or if the else part is taken, otherwise `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is `'1'`. `s` is a list of 30 strings where each `'1'` that was part of a consecutive pair of `'1'`s has been replaced by `'-1'`, the next `'0'` after such a pair has been replaced by `'1'`, and all other `'1'`s that are not part of such pairs remain `'1'`. If `flag` is not 0, the 31st string in `s` is `'1'` and `length` is 31, otherwise `length` is 30.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `flag` is 0 if `s[29]` is `'0'` or if the else part is taken, otherwise `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is `'1'`, `s` is a list of 30 strings. If `s[i] == '-1'` and `s[i - 1] == '1'`, then `s[i - 1]` is updated to `'-1'`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged. `length` is at least 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `flag` is 0 if `s[29]` is `'0'` or if the else part is taken, otherwise `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is `'1'`, `s` is a list of 30 strings where if `s[i] == '-1'` and `s[i - 1] == '1'`, then `s[i-1]` is set to `'-1'` and all other `s[j]` for `j != i-1` are `'0'`, otherwise `s` remains unchanged, `length` is at least 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `flag` is 0 if `s[29]` is `'0'` or if the else part is taken, otherwise `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is `'1'`, `s` is a list of 30 strings where if `s[i] == '-1'` and `s[i - 1] == '1'`, then `s[i-1]` is set to `'-1'` and all other `s[k]` for `k != i-1` are `'0'` unless `s[j] == '-1'` and `s[j - 1] == '1'` for `j != i`, in which case `s[j-1]` is `'-1'` and all other `s[k]` for `k != i-1` and `k != j` are `'0'`. `length` is at least 2, `i` is `i + 1`. If `s[i] == '-1'` and `s[i - 1] == '1'`, then `s[i-1]` is set to `'-1'` and all other `s[k]` for `k != i-1` are `'0'`, otherwise `s` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
