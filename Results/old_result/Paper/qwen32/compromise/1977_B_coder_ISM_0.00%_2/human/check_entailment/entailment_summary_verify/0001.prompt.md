You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    1
    
    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

        for i in range(30):

            s[29] = '0'
            s.append('1')
            length += 1
        for i in range(1, length):
            if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
                s[i] = '0'

- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `x`. For each `x`, it generates a binary representation of length 30, modifies it to ensure no consecutive '1's and '-1's, and then outputs the modified length and the modified binary representation.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Array Constraints**:
   - The array length \( n \) should be between 1 and 32.
   - Each element \( a_i \) in the array should be either 1, 0, or -1.
   - The sum of the array elements, each multiplied by \( 2^i \), should equal the given integer \( x \).
   - No two consecutive elements in the array should be non-zero.

2. **Input**:
   - The first line contains an integer \( t \) representing the number of test cases.
   - Each subsequent line contains a positive integer \( x \) (where \( 1 \le x < 2^{30} \)).

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, print the length of the array \( n \).
   - Print the array elements \( a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} \).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `s` to store the binary representation of `x`.
   - It sets the maximum length of the array to 30, which is reasonable since \( x < 2^{30} \).

2. **Binary Conversion**:
   - The program converts `x` to its binary representation by iterating over the bits from 0 to 29.
   - If the \( i \)-th bit of `x` is set, it appends '1' to `s`; otherwise, it appends '0'.

3. **Modification to Meet Constraints**:
   - The program then modifies the binary array to ensure that no two consecutive elements are non-zero.
   - It introduces a `flag` variable to track if the previous element was non-zero.
   - If the current element and the next one are both '1', it changes the current one to '-1' and sets the next one to '0'.
   - If the last element is '-1' and the next one would be '1' (which doesn't exist), it adjusts the last element and appends '1' to the array.

4. **Final Adjustments**:
   - The program checks if the last element needs to be adjusted if the `flag` is set.
   - It also ensures that no two consecutive elements are '1' or '-1' by swapping them if necessary.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the array and the array itself.

### Issues and Corrections:
1. **Binary Conversion**:
   - The binary conversion step is correct, but the array is stored as strings ('1', '0') instead of integers (1, 0).

2. **Modification Logic**:
   - The logic to modify the array to meet the constraints is flawed. The program does not correctly handle the conversion from binary to the required array format. For example, the swapping logic is incorrect and doesn't ensure that no two consecutive elements are non-zero.

3. **Output**:
   - The output format is correct, but the array elements are not correctly converted to integers.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for modifying the array to meet the constraints is incorrect, and the array elements are not correctly converted to integers.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
