To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given loop and understand what it does. The loop starts with `y` equal to `x - 1` and decrements `y` by 1 in each iteration until `y` becomes 2. Inside the loop, it checks if `x` is divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`). If `x` is divisible by `y` and `2 * y >= x`, the function returns `y` immediately. Otherwise, it updates `max_val` to `y` if `x` is divisible by `y`.

Given that `max_val` is initially set to 1, and the loop updates `max_val` to the largest divisor `y` of `x` such that `2 * y < x`, the final value of `max_val` will be the largest proper divisor of `x` that satisfies the condition `2 * y < x`.

Output State: **max_val is the largest proper divisor of x such that 2 * max_val < x.**
