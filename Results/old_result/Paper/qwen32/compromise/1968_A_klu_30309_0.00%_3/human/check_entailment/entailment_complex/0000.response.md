### Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the program, we need to analyze whether the function `func_1(x)` correctly finds an integer `y` (where `1 <= y < x`) that maximizes the expression \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

The function `func_1(x)` iterates from `x-1` down to `2` and checks if `x % y == 0` (i.e., if `y` is a divisor of `x`). If `2 * y >= x`, it immediately returns `y`. Otherwise, it keeps track of the largest proper divisor of `x` that is less than `x/2` in `max_val`.

This approach works because:
1. If `y` is a divisor of `x`, then \(\gcd(x, y) = y\).
2. The function prioritizes finding the largest `y` such that `2 * y >= x`, which maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y = y + y = 2 * y\).
3. If no such `y` is found, it returns the largest proper divisor of `x` that is less than `x/2`, which still maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) because \(\gcd(x, y) = y\) and `y` is maximized.

Let's check the provided example outputs:
- For `x = 10`, the largest `y` such that `2 * y >= x` is `5`, and \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10\).
- For `x = 7`, the largest `y` such that `2 * y >= x` is `6`, and \(\gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 7\).
- For `x = 21`, the largest `y` such that `2 * y >= x` is `18`, and \(\gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 21\).
- For `x = 100`, the largest `y` such that `2 * y >= x` is `98`, and \(\gcd(100, 98) + 98 = 100\).
- For `x = 2`, the only possible `y` is `1`, and \(\gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2\).
- For `x = 1000`, the largest `y` such that `2 * y >= x` is `750`, and \(\gcd(1000, 750) + 750 = 1250\).
- For `x = 6`, the largest `y` such that `2 * y >= x` is `3`, and \(\gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 6\).

All the provided outputs are correct based on the logic of the function.
