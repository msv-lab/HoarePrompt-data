To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to continue the loop from where we left off and calculate the values of `dp` up to `dp[m]`.

From the provided output states:
- After 1 iteration, `dp[3] = 7`
- After 2 iterations, `dp[4] = 25`
- After 3 iterations, `dp[5] = 81`

Given that `m` is at least 5 (from the third output state), we will calculate `dp` for the remaining iterations until `i` reaches `m`. For the sake of this example, let's assume `m = 6` (we can extend this if `m` is larger).

We will use the provided formula:
\[ dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \mod (10^9 + 7) \]

Let's continue the loop:

For `i = 6`:
\[ dp[6] = (dp[5] + (6 - 1) * dp[4] * 2) \mod (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[6] = (81 + 5 * 25 * 2) \mod (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[6] = (81 + 250) \mod (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[6] = 331 \]

The loop will stop here since `i` will be incremented to 7, which is greater than `m = 6`.

Thus, the final `dp` list will be:
\[ dp = [0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331] \]

The final output state is:
Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `num` is the sum of increments from all iterations (either 1 or 2 per iteration), `m` is 6, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with elements `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `dp[4]` is 25, `dp[5]` is 81, and `dp[6]` is 331.**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` remains 0, `n` and `k` are still the integers from the input, `num` is the sum of the increments from all iterations, `m` is 6, and the `dp` list contains the values `[0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331]`.
