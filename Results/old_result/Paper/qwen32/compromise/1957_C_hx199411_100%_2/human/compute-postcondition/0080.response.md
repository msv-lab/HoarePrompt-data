Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, we need to calculate the new state of the `dp` list specifically for the index `i = 5`.

Initial State: 
- `t` is 0
- `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input
- `num` is the sum of increments from all iterations (either 1 or 2 per iteration)
- `m` is at least 5
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, and `dp[4]` which is 25
- `i` is 5

The provided code snippet is:
```python
dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

To find the value of `dp[5]`, we substitute `i = 5` into the equation:
```python
dp[5] = (dp[4] + (5 - 1) * dp[3] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

Using the given values of `dp[4]` and `dp[3]`:
- `dp[4]` is 25
- `dp[3]` is 7

Substituting these values in:
```python
dp[5] = (25 + (5 - 1) * 7 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
dp[5] = (25 + 4 * 7 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
dp[5] = (25 + 56) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
dp[5] = 81 % (10 ** 9 + 7)
dp[5] = 81
```

Therefore, the value of `dp[5]` is 81. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `num` is the sum of increments from all iterations (either 1 or 2 per iteration), `m` is at least 5, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with elements `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `dp[4]` is 25, and `dp[5]` is 81, `i` is 5**.
