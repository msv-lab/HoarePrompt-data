Postcondition: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `num` is the total increment based on the `c` and `r` values, `m` is `n - num`, and `m` is not equal to 0. If `m` is 1, the program does not change `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, or `m`. Otherwise, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with `dp[1]` as 1, `dp[2]` as 3, and the rest of the elements calculated up to `dp[m]` using the loop formula.**
