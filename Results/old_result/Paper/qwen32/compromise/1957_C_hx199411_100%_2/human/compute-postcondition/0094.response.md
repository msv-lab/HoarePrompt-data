The code increments the value of `num` by 2. Given that `num` was initially 0, `num` is now 2. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `r`) remain unchanged, except for `m` which is dependent on `num`. Since `num` is now 2, `m` becomes `n - 2`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `num` is 2, `m` is `n - 2`, `c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, and `c` is not equal to `r`**.
