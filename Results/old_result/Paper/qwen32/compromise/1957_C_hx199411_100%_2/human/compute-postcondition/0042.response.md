Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer within the range 0 to 9,999; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer separated by a space; `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`; `m` is equal to `n - num`. If `m` is 0, the program does not change `i` and `m`. If `m` is not 0, `i` is set to `k` unless `m` is 1, in which case `i` is set to 10. If `m` is at least 10, `dp` is a list with `m + 1` elements, all initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, `dp[5]` which is 81, `dp[6]` which is 331, `dp[7]` which is 1303, `dp[8]` which is 5937, `dp[9]` which is 26785, and `dp[10]` which is 133651.**
