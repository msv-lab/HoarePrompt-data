Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

Initial State:
- `t` is 0
- `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input (not explicitly provided)
- `num` is the sum of increments from all iterations (either 1 or 2 per iteration) (not explicitly provided)
- `m` is 6
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with the following values:
  - `dp[1]` is 1
  - `dp[2]` is 3
  - `dp[3]` is 7
  - `dp[4]` is 25
  - `dp[5]` is 81
  - `dp[6]` is 331

Code Snippet:
```python
print(dp[m])
```

Step-by-step Analysis:
1. The variable `m` is explicitly set to 6 in the initial state.
2. The list `dp` is defined with specific values for indices 1 through 6.
3. The print statement `print(dp[m])` will access the element at index `m` in the list `dp`.
4. Since `m` is 6, the statement will evaluate to `dp[6]`.
5. From the initial state, we know that `dp[6]` is 331.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value 331.

Output: **331**
