In this task, the `while` loop condition is `while t:`. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered `True` in a boolean context, and a zero is considered `False`. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `t` is not zero.

Given the state right before the loop is `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 10,000, `t` is already guaranteed to be a non-zero integer. This means the loop can certainly execute one time without any modification to the state of `t`.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 10,000**
