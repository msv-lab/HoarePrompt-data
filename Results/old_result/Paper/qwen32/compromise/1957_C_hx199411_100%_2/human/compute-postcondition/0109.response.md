Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is initialized to 0.
- `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input.
- `num` is the total increment based on the `c` and `r` values (though `c` and `r` are not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, we know `num` is derived from them).
- `m` is calculated as `n - num`.
- `m` is explicitly stated to be equal to 0.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Explanation:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet simply prints the integer `1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m` do not affect the output of this `print` statement because it does not reference any of these variables.

### Output:
The code will print the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
