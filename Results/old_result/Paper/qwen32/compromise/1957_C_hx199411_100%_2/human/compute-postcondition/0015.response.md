The value of `num` is incremented by 2. Initially, `num` is 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 2. After the increment, if `num` was initially 1, it becomes 3, and if `num` was initially 2, it becomes 4. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `r`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 0 to 9,999; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer separated by a space, and `k` must be greater than 0; `c` and `r` are new integers obtained from the latest input, where `c` is the first integer and `r` is the second integer separated by a space; `num` is 3 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 4; `i` is `i + 1`.**
