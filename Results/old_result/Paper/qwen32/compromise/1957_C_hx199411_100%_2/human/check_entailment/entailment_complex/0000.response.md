### Reasoning

The problem requires calculating the number of different final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) moves have been played by a player and the computer. The player's moves are given, and the computer mirrors these moves unless the move is on the diagonal (i.e., \( r = c \)).

The program processes each test case by reading the board size \( n \) and the number of moves \( k \). It then processes \( k \) moves, counting how many of these moves are on the diagonal and how many are off-diagonal. Each off-diagonal move effectively reduces the number of free rows and columns by 2 (one for the player and one for the computer), while each diagonal move reduces it by 1 (only the player places a rook).

After processing the \( k \) moves, the program calculates the remaining number of free rows and columns, \( m \). If \( m \) is 0 or 1, there is only one possible configuration (either no more moves are possible or only one move is possible). For \( m > 1 \), the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place the remaining rooks.

The dynamic programming array `dp` is defined such that `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks in \( i \) free rows and columns. The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` (one way to place one rook) and `dp[2] = 3` (three ways to place two rooks in a 2x2 grid without attacking each other). For \( i > 2 \), the recurrence relation is `dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2`, which accounts for placing a rook in one of the rows and then placing the remaining rooks in the remaining grid in all possible ways.

The program correctly implements this logic and prints the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) for each test case.

### Correctness

Given the analysis above, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the base cases appropriately and uses dynamic programming to compute the number of configurations for larger values of \( m \). The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

**Correctness: True**
