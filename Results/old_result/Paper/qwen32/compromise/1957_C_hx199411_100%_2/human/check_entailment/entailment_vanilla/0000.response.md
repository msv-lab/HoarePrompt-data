Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis
The problem involves a game played on an n x n chessboard where players take turns placing rooks such that no two rooks attack each other (i.e., no two rooks share the same row or column). The player starts by placing a white rook, and the computer mirrors this move by placing a black rook at the mirrored position, unless the rook is placed on the diagonal (r = c), in which case the computer skips its turn. After k moves (both player and computer moves), the task is to determine the number of possible final configurations of the board modulo 10^9+7.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Initial Moves:** The first k moves are given, and the computer mirrors these moves unless the move is on the diagonal.
2. **Remaining Moves:** After k moves, the game continues until no valid moves are left.
3. **Configuration Counting:** The number of possible configurations is to be counted, considering the constraints of rook placement.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing:** The program correctly reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the size of the board `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.
2. **Counting Moves on the Diagonal:** The program counts how many of the initial moves are on the diagonal (`num += 1`) and how many are off the diagonal (`num += 2`), because for off-diagonal moves, both the player and the computer make a move.
3. **Remaining Empty Positions:** The remaining positions on the board that can be used for further moves are calculated as `m = n - num`.
4. **Base Cases:** If `m` is 0 or 1, the number of configurations is 1 (since no more moves can be made).
5. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The program uses a dynamic programming array `dp` to calculate the number of configurations for `m` remaining positions.
   - The base cases are set as `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The recurrence relation used is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, which calculates the number of configurations for `i` remaining positions based on the previous configurations.

### Correctness of the DP Formula:
The DP formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is derived from the fact that for `i` remaining positions:
- One configuration is where the player places a rook in one of the `i` positions, and the computer mirrors it (resulting in `dp[i - 2]` configurations for the remaining positions).
- Another configuration is where the player places a rook on the diagonal, which does not get mirrored, resulting in `dp[i - 1]` configurations for the remaining positions.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of possible final configurations of the board after k moves, using dynamic programming to handle the remaining positions efficiently. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
