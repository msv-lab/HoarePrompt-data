t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and an integer k such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, followed by k pairs of integers (r_i, c_i) such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
