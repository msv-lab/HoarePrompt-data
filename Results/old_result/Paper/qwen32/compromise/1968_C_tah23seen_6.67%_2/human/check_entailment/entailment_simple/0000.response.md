### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the function `func_1` to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

The goal is to construct an array `a` such that:
- `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9` for all `1 ≤ i ≤ n`.
- `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`.

The function `func_1` is supposed to generate such an array `a` given the array `x` (which is `arr` in the function).

#### Analysis of `func_1`:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1`: This sets `a_1` to be one more than `x_2` (which is `arr[0]`). This ensures that `a_1 > x_2`, and thus `x_2 % a_1 = x_2` because `x_2 < a_1`.

2. **Loop for `i` from `0` to `n-3`:**
   - `ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]`: This sets `a_{i+2}` to be the sum of `x_{i+1}` and `a_{i+1}`.
   - The `while` loop ensures that `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `x_{i+1}`. However, the current implementation of the loop is incorrect. The loop should be:
     ```python
     while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
         ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
     ```
     This loop ensures that `a_{i+2}` is the smallest integer greater than `x_{i+1}` that can be expressed as a sum of `a_{i+1}` and its previous values in `ans`.

3. **Final Element:**
   - `ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]`: This sets `a_n` to be the sum of `a_{n-1}` and `x_n`.

#### Issues in the Implementation:

- The loop condition and the logic for ensuring `ans[i + 1] > arr[i + 1]` seems correct, but the loop is not necessary if we initialize `ans[i + 1]` properly. Instead of the loop, we can directly set `ans[i + 1]` to be `ans[i] + arr[i]` if `ans[i] + arr[i] > arr[i + 1]`, otherwise, we need to add multiples of `ans[i]` until the condition is satisfied.

However, the given implementation does not guarantee that the condition `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` is satisfied for all `i` from `2` to `n`. The loop logic is flawed and does not ensure that `ans[i + 1]` is the smallest integer greater than `arr[i + 1]` that can be expressed as a sum of `ans[i]` and its previous values in `ans`.

#### Correct Implementation:

A correct approach would be:
```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 1):
        ans[i + 1] = ans[i] + arr[i]
        while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
            ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
    return ans
```

### Conclusion:

Given the current implementation, the function `func_1` does not always produce the correct array `a` that satisfies the condition `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `i` from `2` to `n`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
