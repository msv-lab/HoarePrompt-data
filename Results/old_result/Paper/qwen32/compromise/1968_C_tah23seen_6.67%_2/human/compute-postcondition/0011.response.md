To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the pattern in the given output states and the loop's behavior.

### Initial State:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \).
- `n` is an integer such that \( 3 \leq n \leq 500 \).
- `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`.
- `ans[1]` is `2 * arr[0] + 1`.
- `ans[2]` to `ans[n-1]` are initialized to `0`.

### Loop Behavior:
The loop runs while `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` and updates `ans[i + 1]` by adding `ans[i]` to it.

### Observations from Given Output States:
1. **After 1 iteration**:
   - `ans[2]` becomes `2 * arr[0] + 1` (which is `ans[1]`).

2. **After 2 iterations**:
   - `ans[2]` becomes `4 * arr[0] + 2` (which is `ans[1] + ans[1]`).

3. **After 3 iterations**:
   - `ans[2]` becomes `6 * arr[0] + 3` (which is `ans[1] + ans[2]` after the second iteration).

### Generalization:
The loop effectively doubles the value of `ans[i + 1]` and adds `ans[i]` until `ans[i + 1]` exceeds `arr[i + 1]`. This means that `ans[i + 1]` will be a sum of multiples of `ans[i]` until it surpasses `arr[i + 1]`.

### Final State:
The loop will continue to execute until `ans[i + 1] > arr[i + 1]` for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`. The final value of `ans[i + 1]` will be the smallest value greater than `arr[i + 1]` that can be expressed as a sum of `ans[i]`.

### Conclusion:
The final state of `ans` will have each `ans[i + 1]` as the smallest integer greater than `arr[i + 1]` that can be expressed as a sum of `ans[i]` and its previous values.

### Output State:
Output State: **`ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, `ans[2]` is the smallest integer greater than `arr[1]` that can be expressed as a sum of `ans[1]` and its previous values, and so on until `ans[n-1]` is the smallest integer greater than `arr[n-2]` that can be expressed as a sum of `ans[n-2]` and its previous values.**

In simpler terms, each `ans[i + 1]` will be the smallest multiple of `ans[i]` (plus some previous sums) that exceeds `arr[i + 1]`.
