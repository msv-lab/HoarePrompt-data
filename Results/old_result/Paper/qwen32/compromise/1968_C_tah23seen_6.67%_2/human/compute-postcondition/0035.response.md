Output State: **The program returns the list `ans` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is the smallest integer greater than `arr[i]` that can be expressed as a sum of `ans[i]` and its previous values in `ans`; `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.**

This means the list `ans` is constructed based on the rules provided, starting with `ans[0]` being one more than the first element of `arr`, and each subsequent element being the smallest integer greater than the corresponding element in `arr` that can be formed by summing `ans[i]` with any of its previous elements, and finally `ans[-1]` being the sum of the second-to-last element of `ans` and the last element of `arr`.
