Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500 representing the number of elements in the array `a`, which is one more than the length of `arr`. The function is called for each test case, with the number of test cases `t` satisfying 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of all `n` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `ans` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0.**

In simpler terms, the list `ans` has been created with `n` elements, all set to 0, while all other initial conditions remain unchanged.
