The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is the smallest integer greater than `arr[i]` that can be expressed as a sum of `ans[i]` and its previous values in `ans`. The last element `ans[-1]` is the sum of `ans[-2]` and `arr[-1]`.
