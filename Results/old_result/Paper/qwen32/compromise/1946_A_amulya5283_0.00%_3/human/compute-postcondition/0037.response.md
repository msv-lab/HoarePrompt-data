The code snippet pushes the value `smallest + 1` onto the heap. This means that the heap will now include this new value, and the heap property will be maintained.

Given the initial state, the variable `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes the value `smallest + 1`. After executing `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)`, the heap will still be a valid heap, but it will now contain the new value `smallest + 1`.

The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`, `smallest`, `operations`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple represents a test case consisting of an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `results` is a list containing the value 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases` sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value of `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes the value `smallest + 1` such that `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`, `operations` is 1, `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from the heap.**
