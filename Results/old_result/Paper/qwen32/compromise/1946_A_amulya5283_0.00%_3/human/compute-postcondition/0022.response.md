The code snippet provided appends the value of `operations` to the list `results`. This means that the list `results` will now contain the value of `operations` as its last element. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`, `heap`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple represents a test case consisting of an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is set to a valid index, `n` is the integer from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted list from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` where all elements are greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the total number of iterations the loop executed until it terminated.**
