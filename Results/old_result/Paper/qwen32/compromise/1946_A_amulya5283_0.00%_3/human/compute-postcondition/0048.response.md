The code snippet provided is `median_index = n // 2`. This line recalculates the value of `median_index` based on the current value of `n`.

Given the initial state, `median_index` is already defined as `n // 2`. Since the code snippet reassigns `median_index` with the same expression, the value of `median_index` does not change. Therefore, the output state will reflect the same conditions as the initial state, with the exception that the reassignment operation is noted.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, `results` is a list containing the value 0 and the value of `operations`, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value of `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` where all elements are greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the total number of operations performed.**
