The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to ensure the loop can execute one more time. Given the loop `for i in range(t):`, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is set to a valid index, which means `i` is in the range `[0, t-1]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value `k` such that `0 <= k < t`.
- For the loop to execute again, `i` must be `k + 1` and `k + 1` must be less than `t`.

Therefore, we need to increment `i` by 1 to start the next iteration.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple represents a test case consisting of an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the integer from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted list from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` where all elements are greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the total number of iterations the loop executed until it terminated.**

However, since only `i` can be adjusted in the loop head, the state should reflect only the change in `i`:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple represents a test case consisting of an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is `i + 1`**
