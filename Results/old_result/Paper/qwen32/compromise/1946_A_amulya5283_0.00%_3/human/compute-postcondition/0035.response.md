To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head. The loop will continue to execute as long as the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` is true.

Given the current state:
- `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes the value `smallest + 1`.
- `current_median` is the value of `arr[median_index]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`. Since `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heap, adjusting `heap[0]` directly would be the most straightforward way to ensure this condition holds.

Therefore, we need to adjust `heap[0]` to be less than or equal to `current_median`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple represents a test case consisting of an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `results` is a list containing the value 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases` sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value of `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes the value `smallest + 1` such that `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`, `operations` is 1, `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from the heap**.
