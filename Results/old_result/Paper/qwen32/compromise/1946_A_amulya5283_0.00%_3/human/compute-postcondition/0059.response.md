The code snippet `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` adds the value `smallest + 1` to the heap. This changes the state of the `heap` variable, but does not affect the other variables directly.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, `results` is a list containing the value 0 and the value of `operations`, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value of `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and `smallest + 1` added, `operations` is 1, `smallest` is the second smallest element in the original heapified `arr[median_index:]`.**

The heap now includes `smallest + 1` as an additional element.
