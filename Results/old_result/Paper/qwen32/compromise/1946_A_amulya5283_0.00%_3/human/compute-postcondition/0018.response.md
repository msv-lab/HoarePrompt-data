Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple represents a test case consisting of an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `i` is set to a valid index, `n` is the integer from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted list from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and `smallest + 1` added such that `smallest + 1 <= current_median`, `smallest` is the smallest element that was just removed from `heap` such that `smallest + 1 <= current_median`, `operations` is 2; `smallest + 1` is pushed into `heap`.**

In simpler terms: The variable `smallest` has been updated to the smallest element that was just removed from the `heap`. The `heap` now contains all the elements it originally had, except for the `smallest` element, and `smallest + 1` has been added to it. All other variables remain unchanged.
