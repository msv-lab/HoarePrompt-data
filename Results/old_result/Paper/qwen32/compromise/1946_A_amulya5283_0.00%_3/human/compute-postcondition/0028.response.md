The code snippet assigns the `heap` variable to be a slice of the `arr` list starting from the `median_index` to the end of the list. This means `heap` will contain the second half of the sorted `arr` list, including the median if `n` is odd.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple represents a test case consisting of an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases` sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value of `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is `arr[median_index:]`.**

In simpler terms, `heap` now holds the second half of the sorted `arr` list, starting from the median index to the end. All other variables retain their previous values.
