Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple represents a test case consisting of an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` for each of the `t` test cases, `i` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer from the last tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted list from the last tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` where all elements are greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the total number of iterations the loop executed for the last test case.`**

In simpler terms: After the loop has executed for all `t` test cases, `results` contains the number of operations needed for each test case. The variables `i`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`, `heap`, and `operations` reflect the state of the last test case processed by the loop.
