The provided Python code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered data is written to the console immediately. However, it does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Given the Initial State: `i` is incremented by 1; `v2` is equal to `i`.

Since `sys.stdout.flush()` does not modify any variables, the values of `i` and `v2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `v2` is equal to `i`.**
