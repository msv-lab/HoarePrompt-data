To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's analyze the loop step-by-step:

1. **Loop Initialization**: The loop starts with `i = 1` and runs until `i < n`. This means the loop will run `n-1` times.
2. **Loop Body**: In each iteration:
   - `v2` is set to the current value of `i`.
   - A query is made to compare elements at indices `v1` and `v2`.
   - If the result `r` is `'<'`, `v1` is updated to `v2`.

The loop essentially narrows down the value of `v1` based on the comparison results. By the end of the loop, `v1` will hold the index of the maximum element in the array (assuming the input responses are consistent with the problem's requirements).

### Final Output State Analysis:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is the loop limit.
- **`g`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`v1`**: After `n-1` iterations, `v1` will be the index of the maximum element in the array.
- **`v2`**: At the end of the loop, `v2` will be `n-1` because the last iteration sets `v2` to `n-2` and then increments `i` to `n-1`, which is the loop exit condition.
- **`prev`**: Remains unchanged unless there was a `'>'` response, but since we are not given any information about `'>'` responses, we assume it remains as initially defined.
- **`kp`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

### Conclusion:
After all iterations, `v1` will be the index of the maximum element in the array, and `v2` will be `n-1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the index of the maximum element in the array, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is `n-1`.**
