The code snippet provided is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered data is written to the console. It does not affect any variables or their values directly.

Given the initial state, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `prev`, `kp`) are modified by the `sys.stdout.flush()` call. The only action taken is to flush the output buffer, which does not change the logical state of the program.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the understanding that the output buffer has been flushed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is `i`, `prev` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is incremented by 1.**
