The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` had some value, and since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 to get to the start of the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` has just finished its current iteration, so it needs to be incremented by 1 to start the next iteration. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `prev`, `kp`, and `r`) are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

Let's assume `i` was some value `x` at the end of the previous iteration. For the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`. Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we'll denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, `v2` is `i` if `r` is '<', otherwise `v2` remains `i`, `prev` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is incremented by 1, and `r` is the user's input, `i` is `i + 1`**
