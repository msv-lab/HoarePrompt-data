The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to the variable `prev`. Since the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we can only say that `prev` will take the value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `i`, `r` is an input string and currently `r` is '>'**.
