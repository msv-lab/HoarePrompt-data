The code assigns the value of `i` to `v2`. However, `i` is not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown. Therefore, `v2` will take on whatever value `i` holds.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is the value of `i`.**
