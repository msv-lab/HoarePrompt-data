The provided code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This command flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the standard output (usually the console). However, it does not modify any variables or affect the state of the program in terms of variable values.

Given the initial state, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `prev`, `kp`, `r`, `i`) are affected by `sys.stdout.flush()`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the index of the maximum element in the array, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `i` if `r` equals `'>'`, otherwise `prev` remains unchanged, `kp` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
