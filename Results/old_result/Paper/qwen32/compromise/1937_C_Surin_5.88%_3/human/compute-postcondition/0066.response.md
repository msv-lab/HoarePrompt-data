To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `g` is initialized to 0.
- `v1` is set to `i`.
- `v2` is set to `i + 1`.
- `prev` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `kp` is incremented by 1.
- `r` is the user's input.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

### Variables in the Print Statement:
- `v1` is explicitly set to `i`.
- `v2` is explicitly set to `i + 1`.

### Analysis:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Given that `v1` is `i` and `v2` is `i + 1`, the output will be formatted as:
- The first `{v1}` will be the current value of `i`.
- The second `{v1}` will also be the current value of `i`.
- The first `{v2}` will be `i + 1`.
- The second `{v2}` will also be `i + 1`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output a formatted string with four values: two instances of `i` followed by two instances of `i + 1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [i] [i] [i + 1] [i + 1] (where i is the current value of i)**
