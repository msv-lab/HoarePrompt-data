The provided code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered data is written to the console. However, this operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Given the initial state, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `prev`) are modified by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, n is greater than 1, g is 0, v1 is the highest value of i for which r was '<', or 0 if no such i exists, v2 is n-1, prev is the highest value of i for which r was '>', or 0 if no such i exists.**
