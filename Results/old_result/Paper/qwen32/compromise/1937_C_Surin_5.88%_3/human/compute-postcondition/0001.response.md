The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it. This does not affect the existing variables `t`, `n`, or the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}`. The only new variable introduced is `R`, which is a lambda function.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴. The sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}. `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it.**
