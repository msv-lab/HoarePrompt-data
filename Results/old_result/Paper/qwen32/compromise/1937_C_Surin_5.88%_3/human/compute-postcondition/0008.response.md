Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `g` is initialized to 0.
- `v1` is initialized to 0.
- `v2` is set to the value of `i`.

However, there is no mention of the variable `i` being defined anywhere in the initial state. Given this, we can assume that `i` is either not used or is defined elsewhere in the code which is not provided here. Since the problem statement only provides the initial state and the print statement, we must work with the information given.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Analysis:
- `v1` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- `v2` is stated to be the value of `i`, but since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, we'll represent it as `i`.

### Output:
Given the above analysis, the print statement will output:
- The first placeholder `{v1}` will be replaced by the value of `v1`, which is 0.
- The second placeholder `{v1}` will also be replaced by the value of `v1`, which is 0.
- The third placeholder `{v2}` will be replaced by the value of `v2`, which is `i`.
- The fourth placeholder `{v2}` will also be replaced by the value of `v2`, which is `i`.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is the value of the variable i)**
