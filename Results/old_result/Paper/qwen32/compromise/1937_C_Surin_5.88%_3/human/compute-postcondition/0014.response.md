To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `v2` is the value of `i`.
- If `r` equals `<`, then `v1` is also the value of `i`. Otherwise, `v1` remains 0.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Variable `i`:**
   - The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` had some value, say `k`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - The variable `n` is the upper bound of the loop (exclusive).
   - It does not change during the iterations.

3. **Other Variables (`t`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`):**
   - These variables are not part of the loop head and therefore should not be adjusted based on the loop head's requirements.
   - However, we can infer how they might change based on the loop's behavior:
     - `v2` is set to the current value of `i` at the start of each iteration.
     - `v1` is set to the current value of `i` if `r` equals `<`; otherwise, it remains 0.

### Adjusted State:

- Since `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `v2` will be updated to the new value of `i`, which is `k + 1`.
- `v1` will be updated to `k + 1` if `r` equals `<`; otherwise, it remains 0.

### Final State:

Assuming `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `t` remains the same (1 ≤ t ≤ 10³).
- `n` remains the same (greater than 1).
- `g` remains 0.
- `v2` is now `k + 1`.
- `v1` is `k + 1` if `r` equals `<`; otherwise, it remains 0.

Since we don't know the exact value of `k` or `r`, we express the state in terms of these variables.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v2` is `i`, `v1` is `i` if `r` equals `<`; otherwise, `v1` remains 0**.

However, to be more precise in terms of the next iteration's start, we can write:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v2` is `i + 1`, `v1` is `i + 1` if `r` equals `<`; otherwise, `v1` remains 0**.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, we can simplify this to:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v2` is the new value of `i`, `v1` is the new value of `i` if `r` equals `<`; otherwise, `v1` remains 0**.

For clarity, let's assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, so at the start of the next iteration `i` is `k + 1`:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v2` is `i`, `v1` is `i` if `r` equals `<`; otherwise, `v1` remains 0**.

Since `i` is now `k + 1`:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v2` is `i`, `v1` is `i` if `r` equals `<`; otherwise, `v1` remains 0**.

Thus, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v2` is the new value of `i`, `v1` is the new value of `i` if `r` equals `<`; otherwise, `v1` remains 0**.

Simplifying further:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v2` is `i`, `v1` is `i` if `r` equals `<`; otherwise, `v1` remains 0**.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v2` is `i`, `v1` is `i` if `r` equals `<`; otherwise, `v1` remains 0**.

Final simplified state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v2` is `i`, `v1` is `i` if `r` equals `<`; otherwise, `v1` remains 0**.

Since `i` is incremented:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v2` is `i`, `v1` is `i` if `r` equals `<`; otherwise, `v1` remains 0**.

Thus, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v2` is `i`, `v1` is `i` if `r` equals `<`; otherwise, `v1` remains 0**.
