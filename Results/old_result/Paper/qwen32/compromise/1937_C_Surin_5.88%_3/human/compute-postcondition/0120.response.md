Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `r` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 1`. If `r` is '<', then `v1` and `v2` are both set to `i + 1`. Otherwise, `v1` remains `i` and `v2` remains `i + 1`. `prev` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists, and `kp` is `n-1`.**
