To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n):`, which means the loop variable is `i` and the range is from 1 to `n-1`.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Variable (`i`)**: This variable is automatically initialized to 1 when the loop starts, so there's no need to adjust its initial value manually.
2. **Range (`1, n`)**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. If `n` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute because the range would be empty.

### Variables Outside Loop Head:
- `t`: This variable is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). It is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
- `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `prev`, `kp`: These variables are also not part of the loop head and do not affect whether the loop will execute.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 1.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is incremented by 1**
