The code snippet `v1 = v2` assigns the current value of `v2` to `v1`. Given the initial state, `v1` was `i` and `v2` was `i + 1`. After the assignment, `v1` will now also be `i + 1`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `g`, `prev`, `kp`, `r`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i + 1`, `v2` is `i + 1`, `prev` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is incremented by 1, and `r` is the user's input, `i` is `i + 1`.**
