The code snippet `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Given that `v2` is `i`, `v1` will now also be `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, `v2` is `i`, `prev` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is incremented by 1, `r` is the user's input, and `r` is '<'.**
