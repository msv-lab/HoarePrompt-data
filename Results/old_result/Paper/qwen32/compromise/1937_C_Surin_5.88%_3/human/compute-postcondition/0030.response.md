To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n):`, which means the loop variable `i` will iterate from 1 to `n-1`.

Let's analyze the given state and the loop:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³ (This variable is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need adjustment.)
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 (This variable is part of the loop head and determines the range of the loop.)
- `g` is 0 (This variable is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need adjustment.)
- `v1` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists (This variable is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need adjustment.)
- `v2` is `n-1` (This variable is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need adjustment.)
- `prev` is 0 (This variable is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need adjustment.)

The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the range function `range(1, n)` requires `n` to be greater than 1 to produce any values.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `n` to ensure the loop can execute. The initial state of `i` does not need to be set manually as it is controlled by the `range` function in the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0**
