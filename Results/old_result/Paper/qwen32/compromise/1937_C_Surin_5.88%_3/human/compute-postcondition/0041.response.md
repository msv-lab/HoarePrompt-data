The value of `prev` is updated to the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `i`, `r` is an input string, `i` is incremented by 1.**
