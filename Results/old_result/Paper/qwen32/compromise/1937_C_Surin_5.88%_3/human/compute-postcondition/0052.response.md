In the given task, the loop head only contains the variable `kp` which iterates over the range specified by `int(input())`. Therefore, we need to adjust only the state of `kp`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³
- `n` is greater than 1
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists
- `v2` is `n-1`
- `prev` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists

Since the loop iterates over `kp` in `range(int(input()))`, the value of `kp` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration to occur.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '>', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is incremented by 1**
