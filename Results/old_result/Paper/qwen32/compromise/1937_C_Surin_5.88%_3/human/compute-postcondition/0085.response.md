The code snippet provided is `prev = i`. This line assigns the value of `i` to the variable `prev`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `prev` now holds the value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '<' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `i`, `kp` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, `r` is '>'**.
