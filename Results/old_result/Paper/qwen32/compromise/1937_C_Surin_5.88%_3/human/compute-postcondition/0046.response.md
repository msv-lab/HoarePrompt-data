The code snippet `r = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `r`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the updated state will reflect that `r` now holds the value of the input string provided by the user. All other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is an input string, `i` is incremented by 1**.
