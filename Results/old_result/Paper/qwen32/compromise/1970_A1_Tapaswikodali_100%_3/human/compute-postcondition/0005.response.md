The code sorts the `balance_info` list based on two criteria: the `balance` attribute in ascending order and the `position` attribute in descending order. This means that if two `BalanceInfo` objects have the same `balance`, the one with the higher `position` will appear first in the sorted list.

Given the initial state, the `balance_info` list contains objects with `balance`, `index`, and `character` attributes. After sorting, the order of these objects in the list will change according to the specified criteria.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is a list of `BalanceInfo` objects sorted by `balance` in ascending order and by `position` in descending order for objects with the same `balance`; `balance` is 0.**

In simpler terms, the `balance_info` list is now sorted such that objects with lower balance values come first, and if two objects have the same balance, the one with the higher index appears first.
