#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects that have attributes 'balance' and 'position', where 'balance' is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and 'position' is an integer representing the position of the character in the sequence.
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between `infoA.balance` and `infoB.balance`, where `infoA.balance` is not equal to `infoB.balance`.
    #State: `infoA` and `infoB` are objects that have attributes 'balance' and 'position', where 'balance' is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and 'position' is an integer representing the position of the character in the sequence. The balance of `infoA` is equal to the balance of `infoB`.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two objects, `infoA` and `infoB`, each with attributes `balance` and `position`. It returns the difference between `infoA.balance` and `infoB.balance` if they are not equal. If `infoA.balance` is equal to `infoB.balance`, it returns the difference between `infoB.position` and `infoA.position`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.

    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))

        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: s is a string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; n is the length of s; balance_info is a list of BalanceInfo objects, each containing the balance, index, and character at that index for each character in s; balance is 0.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: s (where s is the original balanced parentheses sequence)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a string `s` consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. It prints the original string `s` after performing a series of operations on it.
