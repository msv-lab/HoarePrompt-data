To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand what the code does. The loop reads the coordinates of four corners of a square for `a` iterations, calculates the side length of the square, and then prints the area of the square.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the code works:

1. For each iteration, it reads four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.
2. It then determines the side length of the square by checking the x-coordinates of the points:
   - If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, the side length is the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of the points.
   - If `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, the side length is the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of the points.
   - If `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, the side length is the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of the points.
3. Finally, it calculates the area of the square by squaring the side length and prints the result.

The output state will be a series of printed values, each representing the area of one of the squares.

Let's assume `a` is the number of test cases, and for each test case, the coordinates of the corners are provided. The output will be the areas of the squares corresponding to each set of coordinates.

Since we don't have specific input values, we can't calculate the exact numerical output. However, we can describe the format of the output state.

For example, if `a = 3` and the coordinates for the three test cases are provided, the output will look something like this:

Output State: **area1 area2 area3**

Where `area1`, `area2`, and `area3` are the areas of the squares for the first, second, and third test cases, respectively.

Thus, the final output state in the required format is:

Output State: **area1 area2 ... areaa** (where area1, area2, ..., areaa are the areas of the squares for each of the a test cases)
