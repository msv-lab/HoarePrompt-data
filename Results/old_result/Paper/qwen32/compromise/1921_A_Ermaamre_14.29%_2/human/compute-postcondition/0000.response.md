The code snippet `a = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `a`. The initial state describes the coordinates of the corners of a square for multiple test cases, but the provided code snippet does not affect these coordinates directly. The only change is the introduction of the variable `a` with the value of the input integer.

Output State: **Each testcase consists of four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The number of testcases, t, satisfies 1 <= t <= 100; `a` is an input integer.**
