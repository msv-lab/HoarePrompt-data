### Reasoning:

The provided program reads multiple test cases where each test case consists of four points representing the corners of a square. The goal is to determine the area of the square.

Here is a breakdown of the program's logic:
1. The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), and (x4, y4).
3. It then checks for which two x-coordinates are equal (indicating a vertical side of the square) and calculates the length of the side using the corresponding y-coordinates.
4. The area is computed as the square of the side length and printed.

The logic is correct because:
- For a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, two of the x-coordinates will be the same (indicating the vertical sides), and the other two x-coordinates will be the same (indicating the horizontal sides).
- The side length can be determined by the difference in y-coordinates for the vertical sides or the difference in x-coordinates for the horizontal sides.
- The area is correctly calculated as the square of the side length.

The program handles all possible configurations of the input points (since the points are given in random order, the program checks all possible pairs of equal x-coordinates).
