You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks available. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: t is the number of test cases; n is the number of sticks available for the current test case; a is a list of integers representing the lengths of the sticks for the current test case; ans is 0; cnt is a dictionary where each key is a unique stick length from the list `a` and each value is the count of how many times that stick length appears in `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
        
    #State: t is the number of test cases; n is the number of sticks available for the current test case; a is a list of integers representing the lengths of the sticks for the current test case; ans is the total number of complete sets of three sticks that can be formed from the sticks of each unique length; cnt is a dictionary where each key is a unique stick length from the list `a` and each value is the count of how many times that stick length appears in `a`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the total number of complete sets of three sticks that can be formed from the sticks of each unique length)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a number of sticks and their respective lengths. For each test case, it calculates and prints the total number of complete sets of three sticks that can be formed from the sticks of each unique length.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program is incorrect because it only considers forming polygons with 3 sides (triangles) by dividing the count of each stick length by 3. However, the problem description allows for forming any regular polygon with equal-sided sides, not just triangles. 

For example, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
We can form a regular hexagon (6-sided polygon) using all 6 sticks of length 2.

However, the given program will output `2` because it divides the count of sticks of length 2 by 3, resulting in `2` triangles, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

Therefore, the program is not handling the general case of forming polygons with more than 3 sides, making it incorrect.
