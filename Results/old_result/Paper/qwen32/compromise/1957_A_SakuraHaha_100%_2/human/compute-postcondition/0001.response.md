The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string values, converts each of these to an integer, and then stores them in a list named `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is the number of test cases.
- `n` is the number of sticks available for the current test case.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are the lengths of the sticks for the current test case.

The code only affects the variable `a` by assigning it the list of stick lengths for the current test case. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases; `n` is the number of sticks available for the current test case; `a` is a list of integers representing the lengths of the sticks for the current test case.**
