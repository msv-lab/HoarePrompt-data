### Reasoning:

The provided program is not correctly solving the problem as described. The program has a few critical issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program is incorrectly reading the input. The variable `c` in the function `func_1` is intended to be the length of the list `a`, but the function is checking if `c` (which is `len(a)`) equals 2. This check will never be true because `c` is an integer representing the length of the list, not the list itself. The correct approach would involve checking the actual list `a` for specific patterns or values.

2. **Logic for Maximum Sum**: The program is not implementing the logic to calculate the maximum sum of the array. For example, in the first example, the program should output `4 1` and `1 2` because the MEX operation on the array `[0, 1]` should result in `[2, 2]`, giving a maximum sum of 4. However, the function `func_1` hardcoded the output to `4 1` and `1 2` only when `c` is 2, which is not a general solution.

3. **Generalization**: The program does not generalize to other cases. For instance, when the input is `[1, 3, 9]`, the program outputs `13 0`, which is correct, but this is hardcoded and not derived from the logic of the problem. Similarly, for the input `[1, 100, 2, 1]`, the program should output `105 2` with the operations `3 3` and `3 4`, which is not handled by the current program.

4. **Output Format**: The program is not dynamically generating the output based on the input. It is only providing hardcoded outputs for specific cases, which is not a valid solution for all possible inputs.
