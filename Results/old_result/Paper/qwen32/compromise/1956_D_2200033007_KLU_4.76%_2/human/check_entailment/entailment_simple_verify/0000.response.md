### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. The program only handles two specific cases (when the length of the array is 2 and when it is not 2) and does not provide a general solution for any array length or values.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Handling Specific Cases:**
   - **Case with n = 2 and values other than 0 and 1:**
     - The program outputs `4 1` and `1 2` only when the length of the array is 2. However, this is correct only for the specific example given in the problem description (`0 1`). For other values, the MEX (Minimum Excluded Value) calculation and the subsequent operations to maximize the sum are not performed correctly. For example, for the input `2 3`, the MEX is `0`, and the array should be transformed to `[0, 0]` with a sum of `0`, but the program outputs `4 1` and `1 2`, which is incorrect.
   
   - **Case with n > 2 and values other than 1, 3, 9:**
     - The program outputs `13 0` for any array length greater than 2, regardless of the actual values in the array. This is incorrect because the sum can be increased by performing operations to maximize the MEX and updating the array accordingly. For example, for the input `4 1 2 3 4`, the expected output involves multiple operations to maximize the sum, but the program outputs `13 0`, which is incorrect.
   
   - **Case with n = 1 and value other than 0:**
     - The program outputs `1 1` and `1 1` only when the length of the array is 1 and the value is `0`. For other values, the MEX calculation and the operation to maximize the sum are not performed correctly. For example, for the input `5`, the MEX is `0`, and the array should be transformed to `[0]` with a sum of `0`, but the program outputs `1 1` and `1 1`, which is incorrect.

2. **Lack of General Solution:**
   - The program does not implement any logic to compute the MEX and perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array. It only provides hardcoded outputs for specific cases, which is not a general solution. The program does not handle the dynamic nature of the problem where the MEX value and the operations needed to maximize the sum can vary based on the input array.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
