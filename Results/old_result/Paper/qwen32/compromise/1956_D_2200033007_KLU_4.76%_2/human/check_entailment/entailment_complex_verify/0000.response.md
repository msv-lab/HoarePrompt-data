### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the program and the annotations to understand why:

1. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the length of the array `c`.
   - Inside `func_1`, it checks if `c` (which is the length of the array) is equal to 2.
   - If true, it prints `4 1` followed by `1 2`.
   - If false, it prints `13 0`.
   - The function `func_1` does not perform any operations on the array or compute the MEX value to maximize the sum.

2. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations correctly state that the condition `if (c == 2)` will never be true because `c` is the length of the array (an integer), not the array itself.
   - The annotations also correctly note that the function will always print `13 0` for any valid input list, as the condition `c == 2` will never be met.

3. **Evaluation Against Problem Description:**
   - The problem requires the program to compute the MEX of subarrays and perform operations to maximize the sum of the array.
   - The provided program does not implement any such logic.
   - The hardcoded outputs for specific cases do not generalize to all possible inputs.

### Specific Cases:

- **Case with n = 2 and values other than 0 and 1:**
  - The program outputs `4 1` followed by `1 2` for any `n = 2`, regardless of the values in the array. This is incorrect if the values are not `0` and `1`.

- **Case with n > 2 and values other than 1, 3, 9:**
  - The program outputs `13 0` for any `n > 2`, which is incorrect as the sum can be increased by performing operations to compute the MEX and update the array.

- **Case with n = 1 and value other than 0:**
  - The program outputs `1 1` followed by `1 1` for any `n = 1`, regardless of the value in the array. This is incorrect if the value is not `0`.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is correct. The program does not implement the required logic to solve the problem and only provides hardcoded outputs for specific cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
