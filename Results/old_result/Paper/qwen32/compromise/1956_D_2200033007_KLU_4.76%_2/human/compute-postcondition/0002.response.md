Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

Initial State:
- `c` is a list of integers where the length of `c` is between 1 and 18 inclusive, and each integer in `c` is between 0 and 10^7 inclusive.
- `m` is 0.
- The current value of `c` is equal to 2. (Note: This statement seems to be a bit ambiguous because `c` is a list, and saying "the current value of `c` is equal to 2" is not typical. It might be a mistake, and it could mean that the list `c` contains the integer 2.)

However, the print statement provided is:
```python
print(f'4 1')
```

This print statement is a formatted string that contains the literal characters '4' and '1', separated by a space. It does not depend on the values of `c` or `m` at all.

Therefore, the output will be exactly as specified in the print statement.

Output: **4 1**
