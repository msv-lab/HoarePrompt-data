You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.

            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts, given the following:
- The price of one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The price of two yogurts with a promotion is `b` burles.

#### Key Points:
1. **Regular Purchase:** Buying `n` yogurts at regular price would cost `n * a` burles.
2. **Promotion Purchase:** Buying yogurts in pairs (when possible) at the promotion price would cost `(n // 2) * b` burles. If `n` is odd, we would need to buy one additional yogurt at the regular price, adding `a` burles to the cost.

### Program Analysis:
Let's examine the logic in the provided program:

1. **Reading Inputs:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Logic to Determine Minimum Cost:**
   - The program first checks if `2 * a < b`. If true, it means buying two yogurts at regular price is cheaper than the promotion price. Therefore, it prints `n * a` as the cost.
   - If `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`), it calculates the cost as `(n / 2) * b` and prints it.
   - If `n` is odd, it calculates the cost as `(n // 2) * b + a` and prints it.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Handling of Promotion Price:** The condition `if B * 2 < C` is not correctly implemented. The program should compare `2 * a` with `b` to decide whether to use the promotion or not. However, the variable names used are `A`, `B`, and `C`, which don't match the problem statement's `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- **Output Errors:** In the case where `n` is odd, the program incorrectly prints `X` (which is `A // 2`) before printing the final cost. This results in an extra output line for each odd `n`.

### Correct Implementation:
Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate cost if buying all yogurts at regular price
        cost_regular = n * a
        # Calculate cost if buying as many pairs as possible and the remaining single yogurt
        cost_promotion = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a
        # Print the minimum of the two costs
        print(min(cost_regular, cost_promotion))

# Call the function to run the program
func()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program contains logical errors and incorrect variable usage. As a result, it does not correctly solve the problem as described.
