Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**

**Natural Language Explanation:** The variable `t` is updated to be an integer input by the user, which represents the number of test cases. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged as they are not affected by this single line of code.
