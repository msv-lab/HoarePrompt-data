The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `m` is at least 2, `b` is the binary string input by the user where `b[0]` is different from `a[0]` and `b[1]` is different from `a[0]`, `k` is 0, `j` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
