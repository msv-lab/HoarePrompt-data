The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `m`, `b`, `k`, `n`) remain unchanged. The Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `b` is the binary string input by the user where `b[0]` is different from `a[0]`, `k` is 0, `j` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.**
