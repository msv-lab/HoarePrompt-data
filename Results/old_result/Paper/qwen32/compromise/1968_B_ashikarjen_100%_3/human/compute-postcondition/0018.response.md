Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `b` is the binary string input by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is less than `m`, then `k` is 1 and `j` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `k` is 0 and `j` is equal to `m`.**
