To ensure that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions in the loop head: `j < m` and `b[j] != a[i]`.

Let's break it down:

1. **Condition `j < m`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5.
   - Since `j` is 1, for the condition `j < m` to be true, `m` must be greater than 1. Given that `m` is at least 1, it will definitely be greater than 1. Thus, no adjustment is needed for `m` or `j` based on this condition alone.

2. **Condition `b[j] != a[i]`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `j` is 1.
   - `b[0] != a[0]` is given.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `b[j]` (which is `b[1]` in the next iteration) must not be equal to `a[i]` (which is `a[0]`).
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `b[1] != a[0]`.

Given the above considerations, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `b[1]` to ensure that `b[1] != a[0]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `b` is the binary string input by the user with `b[1] != a[0]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `b[0] != a[0]`**
