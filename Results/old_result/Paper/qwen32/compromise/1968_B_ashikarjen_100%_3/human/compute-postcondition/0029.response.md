The code snippet `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Therefore, the value of `j` will now be the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[0]` plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `b` is the binary string input by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[0]` plus 1, `k` is incremented by 1.**
