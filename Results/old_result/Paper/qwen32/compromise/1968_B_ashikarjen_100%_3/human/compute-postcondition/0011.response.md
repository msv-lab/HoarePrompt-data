Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `m` must be greater than 2, `b` is the binary string input by the user where `b[0]` is different from `a[0]`, `b[1]` is different from `a[0]`, `b[2]` is different from `a[i]`, `k` is 0, `j` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**

The value of `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` changes from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
