Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `b` is the binary string input by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, and if `j` was initially less than `m`, then `j` is increased by 1 and `k` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `j` is equal to `m` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
