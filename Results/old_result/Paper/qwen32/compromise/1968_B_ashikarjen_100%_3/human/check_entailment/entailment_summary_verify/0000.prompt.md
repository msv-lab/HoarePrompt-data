You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

    11010

    0

Output

    2
    2

    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)
    return



- Function Summary: 
The function reads two integers `n` and `m`, followed by two binary strings `a` and `b`. It calculates the maximum number of characters from `a` that can be found in `b` in the same order and prints this count. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum possible number \( k \) such that a prefix of string \( a \) of length \( k \) is a subsequence of string \( b \). Here's a breakdown of how the program works and why it should be correct for all potential cases:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the lengths of strings \( a \) and \( b \), followed by the strings themselves.
2. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes two pointers: \( k \) to count the length of the prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \), and \( j \) to traverse string \( b \).
3. **Subsequence Checking**: The program iterates over each character in string \( a \) and uses a while loop to find the next occurrence of that character in string \( b \). If the character is found, it increments \( k \) and moves the pointer \( j \) to the next position in \( b \). If the character is not found, the loop breaks, and the current value of \( k \) is printed as the result for that test case.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where \( a \) or \( b \) is empty, or where no characters of \( a \) are found in \( b \).

The logic seems correct and efficient for the given problem constraints. The program should work correctly for all valid inputs as per the problem description. No potential cases where the program does not work as expected were found during the analysis.
