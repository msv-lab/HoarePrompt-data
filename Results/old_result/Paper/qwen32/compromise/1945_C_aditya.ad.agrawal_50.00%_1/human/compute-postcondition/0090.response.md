The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which is the loop variable iterating over the list `arr`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` for the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the current element being processed in the list `arr`. For the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `arr`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `pos`, `z_l`, `z_r`, `o_l`, `o_r`, `ans`, `b_d`) are not directly controlled by the loop head and should not be adjusted here.

Given that `i` is the next element in `arr`, and `pos` is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be the element at the new `pos` index in `arr`.

State: **`t` is at least 1; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is the input provided by the user and contains at least one digit; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string` and has at least one element; `z` is the count of the digit 0 in `arr`; `o` is the count of the digit 1 in `arr`; `i` is the next element in `arr` (i.e., `arr[pos]`); `pos` is increased by 1; If `i` is 0, then `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `(b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))`, then `ans` is equal to `pos` and `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`**
