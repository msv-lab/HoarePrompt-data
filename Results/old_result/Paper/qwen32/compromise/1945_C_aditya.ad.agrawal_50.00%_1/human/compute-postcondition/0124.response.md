The code snippet provided decrements the value of `o_r` by 1. The other variables (`arr`, `i`, `pos`, and `o_l`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the decrement of `o_r` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, and `i` is not equal to 0; `o_l` is increased by 1; `o_r` is decreased by 1.**
