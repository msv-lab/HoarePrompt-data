Postcondition: **After all iterations, `pos` will be equal to the length of `arr` (i.e., `n`). `z_l` will be 0. `o_l` will be 0. `z_r` will be equal to the number of 0s in `arr`. `o_r` will be equal to the number of 1s in `arr`. `ans` will be 0. `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer. `input_string` is the input provided. `arr` is a list of integers converted from `input_string`. `z` is the number of 0s in `arr`. `o` is the number of 1s in `arr`. `dist` is equal to `abs(n / 2)`. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of `z_r` and `o_r`, then `b_d` will be equal to `abs(n / 2)`. Otherwise, `b_d` will be 30001.**
