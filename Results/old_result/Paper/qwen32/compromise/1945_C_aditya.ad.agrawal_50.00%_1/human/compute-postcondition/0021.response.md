The code snippet `z_r -= 1` decrements the value of `z_r` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is the input provided by the user; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string` and must have at least one element; `z` is the count of the digit `0` in `arr`; `o` is the count of the digit `1` in `arr`; `z_r` is equal to `z - 1`; `o_r` is equal to `o`; `z_l` is 1; `o_l` is 0; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`; `ans` is `0`; `pos` is `1`; `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)` if `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, otherwise `b_d` is `30001`. The current value of `i` is 0.**
