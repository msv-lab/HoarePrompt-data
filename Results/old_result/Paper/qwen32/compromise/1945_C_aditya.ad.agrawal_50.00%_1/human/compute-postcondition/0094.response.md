The code snippet `o_l += 1` increments the value of `o_l` by 1. Since `i` is not specified to be 0 in this snippet, we assume the code follows the path where `i` is not 0, and thus `o_l` is incremented. No other variables are affected by this specific line of code.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is the input provided by the user and contains at least one digit; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string` and has at least one element; `z` is the count of the digit 0 in `arr`; `o` is the count of the digit 1 in `arr`; `i` is the next element in `arr` (i.e., `arr[pos]`); `pos` is increased by 1; `o_l` is increased by 1; If `i` is 0, then `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `(b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))`, then `ans` is equal to `pos` and `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`**.

In simpler terms, `o_l` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables retain their previous values.
