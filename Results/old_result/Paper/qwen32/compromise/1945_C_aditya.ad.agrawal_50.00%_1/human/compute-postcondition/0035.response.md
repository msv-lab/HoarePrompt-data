The code snippet `o_r -= 1` decrements the value of `o_r` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is the input provided by the user; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string` and must have at least one element; `z` is the count of the digit `0` in `arr`; `o` is the count of the digit `1` in `arr` + 1; `i` is the next element in `arr`; `pos` is incremented by 1; `o_r` is decreased by 1.**
