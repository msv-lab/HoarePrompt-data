Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is set to the current value of `pos` and `b_d` is set to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`. The conditions involving `o_r`, `z_r`, `z_l`, and `o_l` remain as they were, and the changes to `z_l`, `z_r`, `o_l`, `o_r` based on the value of `i` are still valid.**
