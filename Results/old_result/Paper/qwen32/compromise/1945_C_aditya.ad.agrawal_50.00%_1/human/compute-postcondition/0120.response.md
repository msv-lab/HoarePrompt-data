The code snippet `z_l += 1` increments the value of `z_l` by 1. The values of `arr`, `i`, and `pos` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the first element of `arr` and `i` is 0, `pos` is increased by 1, `z_l` is increased by 1.**
