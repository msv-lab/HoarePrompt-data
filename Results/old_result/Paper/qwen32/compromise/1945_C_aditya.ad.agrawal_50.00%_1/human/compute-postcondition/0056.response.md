The code snippet `arr = [int(ch) for ch in input_string]` converts each character in `input_string` to an integer and stores these integers in the list `arr`. This affects the value of `arr` but does not change the other variables.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is the input provided by the user; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string`; `z` is the count of the digit 0 in `arr`; `o` is the count of the digit 1 in `arr`; `z_r` is 0; `o_r` is 0; `z_l` is the count of the digit 0 in `arr`; `o_l` is the count of the digit 1 in `arr`; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`; `ans` is the position where the condition is met for the last time; `pos` is the length of `arr`; `b_d` is the minimum distance from `n / 2` where the condition was met.**

In simpler terms, the list `arr` is now a list of integers derived from `input_string`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
