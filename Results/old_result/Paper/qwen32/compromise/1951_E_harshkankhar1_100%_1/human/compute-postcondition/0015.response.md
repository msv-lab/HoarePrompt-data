The initial state provides several details about the variables involved in the code snippet:

- `s` is the input string provided by the user.
- `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`. This means that `s[0]` is repeated from the start of the string up to the index `x`, and `s[x]` is the first character that differs from `s[0]`.
- `x` is not -1, indicating that there is at least one character in `s` that is different from the first character.
- The result of `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `False`. This means that when the function `func_1` is called with the substring of `s` starting from `x + 1` to the end, it returns `False`.

The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables `s`, `n`, `x`, or the result of `func_1`. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided to be printed.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **YES**
