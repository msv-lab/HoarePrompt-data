Given the initial state, we know the following:
- `s` is the input string provided by the user.
- `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`, or -1 if all characters in `s` are the same.
- The current value of `x` is -1, indicating that all characters in `s` are the same.

The Python code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('NO')
```

Since the value of `x` is -1, it confirms that all characters in the string `s` are the same. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not depend on the values of `s`, `n`, or `x`. It simply prints the string 'NO'.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **NO**
