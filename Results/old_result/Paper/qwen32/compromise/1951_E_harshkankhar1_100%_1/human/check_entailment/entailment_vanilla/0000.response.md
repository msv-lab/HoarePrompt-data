Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Recap:
We need to partition a given string into substrings such that none of the substrings is a palindrome. If such a partition exists, we should print "YES", the number of parts, and the parts themselves. If no such partition exists, we print "NO".

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(s)`: Checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads a string, checks if it can be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings, and prints the result.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Reading Input and Initial Check:**
   - The function reads a string `s`.
   - It immediately checks if the entire string `s` is a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`. If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", 1, and the string `s` itself. This is correct because a non-palindrome string can be considered as a single part of the partition.

2. **Finding the First Non-Matching Character:**
   - If `s` is a palindrome, the function tries to find the first character `s[i]` that is different from `s[0]`. This is done using a loop that breaks when it finds such a character.
   - If no such character is found (`x` remains -1), it means all characters are the same, and thus the string is a palindrome. The function then prints "NO".

3. **Partitioning the String:**
   - If a non-matching character is found at index `x`, the function checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", 2, and partitions the string into `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, the function checks if `x` is 1 or `x` is half the length of the string (`x == n // 2`). If so, it prints "NO" because it cannot find a valid partition.
     - Otherwise, it prints "YES", 2, and partitions the string into `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.

### Correctness Issues:
- **Handling Palindromes with Repeated Characters:**
  - The logic to check for palindromes with repeated characters is flawed. For example, consider the string "abccba". The function will find the first non-matching character at index 1 (character 'b'), but it incorrectly assumes that `s[x + 1:]` (which is "ccba") can be a valid partition without further checks.
- **Multiple Valid Partitions:**
  - The function only considers partitioning the string into two parts. However, there could be multiple valid partitions, and the function might miss them.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly those involving palindromes with repeated characters and multiple valid partitions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
