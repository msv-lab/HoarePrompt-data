### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to ensure the program is correct.

The problem requires us to partition a given string into substrings, where none of the substrings is a palindrome. If it's possible to do so, we need to output "YES", the number of parts, and the parts themselves. If it's not possible, we need to output "NO".

Here's the step-by-step reasoning based on the provided functions:

1. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome, otherwise `False`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`. If it's not a palindrome, it outputs "YES", the number of parts (which is 1), and the string itself as the partition.
   - If the entire string is a palindrome, it then looks for the first position `i` where the character at that position is different from the first character of the string (`s[0]`). This is stored in `x`.
     - If no such position is found (`x == -1`), it means the string consists of the same character repeated, and thus, it cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. In this case, it outputs "NO".
     - If such a position is found, it checks if the substring from `x+1` to the end (`s[x+1:]`) is not a palindrome. If it's not, it outputs "YES", the number of parts (which is 2), and the two partitions: `s[:x+1]` and `s[x+1:]`.
     - If the substring from `x+1` to the end is a palindrome, it further checks if `x` is 1 or `x` is `n // 2`. If either condition is true, it outputs "NO". Otherwise, it outputs "YES", the number of parts (which is 2), and the two partitions: `s[:x+2]` and `s[x+2:]`.

### Analysis of the Code:
- The code correctly handles the case where the entire string is not a palindrome.
- It correctly handles the case where the string consists of the same character repeated.
- It handles the case where the string can be partitioned into two non-palindromic substrings.
- It also correctly handles the edge cases where the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

Given the problem description and the provided execution summaries, the code logic appears to be correct and meets the requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
