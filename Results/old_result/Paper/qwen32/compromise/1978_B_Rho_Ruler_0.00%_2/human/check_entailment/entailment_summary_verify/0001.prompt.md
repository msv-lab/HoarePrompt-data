You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        low = 0
        high = n
        ans = -1
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if func_1(mid, a, b, n):
                ans = mid
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
        print(ans)

def func_1(k, a, b, n):
    ans = 0
    ans += k * b
    ans += (n - k) * a
    return ans <= n * max(a, b)



- Function Summary: 
The function takes four parameters: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n`. It calculates a value based on these parameters and returns `True` if this calculated value is less than or equal to `n` times the maximum of `a` and `b`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

Bob aims to maximize profit by selling his buns at different prices. He can sell the first `k` buns at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b-k+1`, and the remaining `n-k` buns at the usual price `a`. The goal is to find the optimal `k` to maximize profit.

### Program Analysis

The program uses a binary search approach to find the optimal `k` that maximizes profit. However, the function `func_1` does not correctly determine if a given `k` is optimal or not. Instead, it checks if the total revenue from selling `k` buns at modified prices and `n-k` buns at the usual price is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`. This condition does not relate to maximizing profit; it seems to be checking if the total revenue is within some arbitrary limit, which is not relevant to the problem.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to calculate the profit for each possible `k` and choose the one that gives the maximum profit. The profit for a given `k` can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Profit}(k) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1) + (n - k) \cdot a \]

This simplifies to:

\[ \text{Profit}(k) = k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a \]

We can iterate over all possible values of `k` (from 0 to `min(n, b)`) and compute the profit for each `k` to find the maximum profit.

### Correctness of the Given Program

The given program does not implement the correct logic to find the maximum profit. Instead, it incorrectly uses a binary search with a condition that does not relate to maximizing profit. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
