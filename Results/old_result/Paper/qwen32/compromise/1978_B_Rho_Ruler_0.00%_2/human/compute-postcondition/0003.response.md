Output State: **The program returns True**

Explanation: Given the initial state, the expression `ans <= n * max(a, b)` will always evaluate to `True` because `ans` is defined as `k * b + (n - k) * a`. Since `k` is between 0 and `min(n, b)`, the term `k * b` is at most `b * min(n, b)`, and `(n - k) * a` is at least `0`. Therefore, `ans` is at most `n * b` if `k = b` and at least `n * a` if `k = 0`. In either case, `ans` is bounded by `n * max(a, b)`, making the inequality `ans <= n * max(a, b)` always hold true.
