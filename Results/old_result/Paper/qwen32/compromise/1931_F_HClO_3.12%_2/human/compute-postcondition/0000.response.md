Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n * k <= 2 * 10^5. Each of the k lines for a test case contains n distinct integers a_{ij} such that 1 <= a_{ij} <= n, where a_{i0} is the author of the screenshot and is always at the top of the list. It is guaranteed that the sum of n * k for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5 and all the authors of the screenshots are different.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the integer input, which represents the number of test cases. The preconditions for the test cases remain unchanged as they are not affected by the input of `t`.
