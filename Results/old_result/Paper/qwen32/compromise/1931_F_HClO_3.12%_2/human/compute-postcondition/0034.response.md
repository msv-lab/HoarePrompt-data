Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least its original value; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `idx1` is -1; `idx2` is -1; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0; `n` must be at least 2. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. At this point, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`. Additionally, `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`.**
