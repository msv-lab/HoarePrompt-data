Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least its original value; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `n` must be at least 2; `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0, `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0; `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0 if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, otherwise `p1` is 0 and `p2` is 1; `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms: The values of `t`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `n`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
