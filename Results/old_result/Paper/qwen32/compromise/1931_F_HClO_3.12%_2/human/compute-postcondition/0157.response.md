The code snippet provided only modifies the value of `p1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Given that `p1` was initially 0, it is now set to 1. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change while keeping all other variables as they were described in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0, and `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`.**
