The code snippet `l = l1` assigns the value of `l1` to `l`. This means that `l` now holds the same list as `l1`, which includes `a1` inserted at position `idx2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` hold their last updated values, `p1` and `p2` hold their last updated values, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, `l` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`.**
