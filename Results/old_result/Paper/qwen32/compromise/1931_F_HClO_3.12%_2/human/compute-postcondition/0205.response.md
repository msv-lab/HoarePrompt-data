Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is 2 (the second integer from the input), `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` hold their last updated values, `p1` and `p2` hold their last updated values, `val` is an empty list, and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`. Additionally, the condition `m == 2` is true.**
