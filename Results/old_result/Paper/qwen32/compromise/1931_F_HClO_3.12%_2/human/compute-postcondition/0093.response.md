The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value of `a2` at the position `idx1` in the list `l2`. This operation will shift all elements that were originally at and after position `idx1` in `l2` one position to the right.

Given the initial state, `l2` originally contains a sequence of integers, and `a2` is an integer that is being inserted at a specific index `idx1` in `l2`. The other variables such as `t`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `val`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

The output state will reflect the new state of `l2` after the insertion. The other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least its original value; `a1` and `a2` are the first integers from the new input lines; `l1` and `l2` are lists of the remaining integers from the same lines, where `l2` now has `a2` inserted at `idx1`; `l11` and `l22` are lists derived from `l1` and `l2` excluding `a2` and `a1` respectively; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or the index where the mismatch involving `a1` and `a2` was found; `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`; `p1` and `p2` are set based on the last mismatch involving `a1` and `a2`; `i` is the last index checked before breaking the loop; `val` is an empty list; `a3` is the first integer from the new input line; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`.**
