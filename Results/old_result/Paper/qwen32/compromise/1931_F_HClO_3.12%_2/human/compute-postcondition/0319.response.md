The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value of `a2` at the position `idx1` in the list `l2`. This means that the list `l2` will now have `a2` at the index `idx1`, and all elements that were originally at and after `idx1` will be shifted to the right by one position.

Given the initial state, the variable `l2` is modified by the insertion of `a2` at `idx1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the latest input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with `a2` inserted at `idx1`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is -1, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `idx1` is less than `idx2`, `idx2` is -1, `val` is an empty list`.**
