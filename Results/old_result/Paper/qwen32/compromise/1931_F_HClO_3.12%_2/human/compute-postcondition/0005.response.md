Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.
- The current value of `m` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('yes')
```

### Explanation:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward. It prints the string `'yes'`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it is printing a static string.

### Output:
Output: **yes**
