Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's break down what will be printed.

```python
print('yes')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'yes'`. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state are being used in this print statement. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
