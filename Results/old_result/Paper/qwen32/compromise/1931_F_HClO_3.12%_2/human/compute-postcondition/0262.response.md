The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'no'`. This statement is not influenced by any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. The initial state provides details about various variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`), but these do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
