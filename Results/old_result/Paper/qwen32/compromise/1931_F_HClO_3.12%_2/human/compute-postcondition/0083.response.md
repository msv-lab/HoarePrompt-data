Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least its original value; `a1` and `a2` are the first integers from the new input lines; `l1` and `l2` are lists of the remaining integers from the same lines; `l11` and `l22` are lists derived from `l1` and `l2` excluding `a2` and `a1` respectively; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or the index where the mismatch involving `a1` and `a2` was found; `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`; `p1` and `p2` are set based on the last mismatch involving `a1` and `a2`; `i` is the last index checked before breaking the loop; `val` is an empty list.**
