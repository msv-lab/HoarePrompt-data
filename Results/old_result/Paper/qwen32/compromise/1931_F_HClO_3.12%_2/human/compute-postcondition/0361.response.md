The only objects in the loop head are the variables `a3` and `l3`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `val` list. If `val` has at least one more tuple after the current one, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `val` contains at least two tuples, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` are the values of the second tuple in `val`. For the loop to execute one more time, `val` must have at least three tuples, and `a3` and `l3` should be the values of the third tuple in `val`.

State: **`val` contains at least three tuples, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` are the values of the third tuple in `val`**
