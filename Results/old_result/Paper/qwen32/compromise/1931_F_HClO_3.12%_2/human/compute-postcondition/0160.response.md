The code snippet provided is `p2 = 1`, which directly assigns the value `1` to the variable `p2`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`.**

In natural language: The value of `p2` has been changed to `1`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
