The code snippet `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value `a2` at the position `idx1` in the list `l2`. This operation will modify the list `l2` by adding one more element at the specified index, shifting all subsequent elements one position to the right.

Given the initial state, the value of `l2` will change after this operation, but all other variables will remain unchanged. Specifically, `l2` will have `a2` inserted at the position `idx1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least its original value; `a1` and `a2` are the first integers from the new input lines; `l1` and `l2` are lists of the remaining integers from the same lines, with `l2` now having `a2` inserted at `idx1`; `l11` and `l22` are lists derived from `l1` and `l2` excluding `a2` and `a1` respectively, with `l22` now reflecting the insertion of `a2` at `idx1`; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or the index where the mismatch involving `a1` and `a2` was found; `idx1` is less than `idx2`; `p1` and `p2` are set based on the last mismatch involving `a1` and `a2`; `i` is the last index checked before breaking the loop; `val` is an empty list.**
