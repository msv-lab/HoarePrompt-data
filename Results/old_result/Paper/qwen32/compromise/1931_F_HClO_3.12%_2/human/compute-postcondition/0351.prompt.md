Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input unless `idx1` is not greater than `idx2` and `m` was initially 2, in which case `m` becomes 1, or if `idx1` is not greater than `idx2` and `m` was initially greater than 2, in which case `m` becomes `m - 1`. `a1` is the first integer from the latest input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` if `idx1` is greater than `idx2` and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, or `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input with `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`. If `idx1` is less than `idx2`, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with `a2` inserted at `idx1`. `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`. `i` is -1, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1. If `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, `idx1` remains greater than `idx2`, and `val` is an empty list. Otherwise, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, and `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is the first integer from the new input and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` includes the tuple `(a3, l3)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `val` includes the tuples `((a3, l3), (a3, l3)), `m` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `val` includes the tuples `((a3, l3), (a3, l3), (a3, l3))`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
