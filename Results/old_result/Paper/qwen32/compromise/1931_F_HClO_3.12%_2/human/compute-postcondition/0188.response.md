The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the value of `idx2` is now 3, and all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is 3, `idx2` is 3. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
