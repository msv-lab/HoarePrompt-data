Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` hold their last updated values, `p1` and `p2` hold their last updated values, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, `a3` is the first integer from the latest input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, and if `m` is 2, the condition `m == 2` is true. Additionally, if `a1` appears before `a2` in `l3`, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`. Otherwise, `l2` is a list containing elements from the latest input excluding all occurrences of `a1` with `a2` inserted at `idx1`.**

In simpler terms, the variable `m` has been decremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values.
