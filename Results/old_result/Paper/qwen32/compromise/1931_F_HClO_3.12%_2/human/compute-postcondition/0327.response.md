Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, we can analyze the situation step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is set to 0.
- `n` is at least 2.
- `m` is set to 2.
- `a1` is the first integer from the latest input.
- `a2` is the first integer from the new input.
- `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input.
- `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input.
- `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`.
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`.
- `i` is set to -1.
- `p1` is either 0 or 1.
- `p2` is either 0 or 1.
- `idx1` is set to -1.
- `idx2` is set to -1.
- `val` is an empty list.
- `idx1` is equal to or less than `idx2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('yes')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'yes'`. The variables and their values provided in the initial state do not influence the output of this specific `print` statement because it is printing a hardcoded string.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'yes'`.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **yes**
