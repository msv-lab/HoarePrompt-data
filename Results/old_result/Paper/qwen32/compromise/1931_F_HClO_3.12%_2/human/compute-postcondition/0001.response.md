In the provided loop, the loop head only contains the variable `_` and the range function with `t` as its argument. This means that the loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. 

The state before the loop starts includes `t`, `n`, `k`, and the lists of integers `a_{ij}` for each test case. However, according to the instructions, we can only adjust the state of objects in the loop head, which means we can only adjust `t` and the range function's behavior, but not `n`, `k`, or the lists `a_{ij}`.

Given this, the only thing that needs to be ensured for the loop to execute is that `t` is at least 1. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute `t` times.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
