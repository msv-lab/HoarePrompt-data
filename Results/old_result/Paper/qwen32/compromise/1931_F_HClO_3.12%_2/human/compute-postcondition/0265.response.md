The given code snippet sets `idx1` and `idx2` to `-1`. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the latest input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` and `p2` hold their last updated values, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples (`a3`, `l3`). If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the conditions remain as described. If `l11` is equal to `l22`, no changes are made to the variables.**
