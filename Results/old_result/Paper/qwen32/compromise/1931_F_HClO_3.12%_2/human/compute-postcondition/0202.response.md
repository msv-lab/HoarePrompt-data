The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value of `a1` at the position `idx2` in the list `l1`. This means the list `l1` will have one additional element, and the elements at positions `idx2` and above will be shifted to the right. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2` (updated to reflect the new `l1`), `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` hold their last updated values, `p1` and `p2` hold their last updated values, `val` is an empty list, and `idx1` is greater than `idx2`.**
