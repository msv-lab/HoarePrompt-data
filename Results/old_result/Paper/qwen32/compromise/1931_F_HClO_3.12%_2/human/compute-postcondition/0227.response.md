The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common placeholder for a loop variable that we do not intend to use. However, the loop's execution depends on the range, which is `m - 2`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the loop variable and the range condition.

Given that the loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body, we do not need to adjust its state. Instead, we need to ensure that the range condition `m - 2` allows the loop to execute one more time. This means that `m - 2` must be greater than the current iteration count.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. However, `i` is not part of the loop head, so we do not adjust it. The loop variable `_` does not change, and the only thing we need to adjust is the range condition to allow one more iteration.

Since the loop runs `m - 2` times, at the start of the next iteration, the range should still be valid, meaning `m - 2` should be greater than the current iteration count. Given the loop has just finished an iteration, we know that the loop ran for some number of times, and we need to ensure there are more iterations left.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same in terms of the variables provided, except for the implicit iteration count which is managed by the range.

State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` must be at least `n + 1`, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, otherwise `l1` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input with `a2` inserted at position `idx1` if `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `idx1` and `idx2` hold their last updated values, `p1` and `p2` hold their last updated values, `val` is a list containing the tuples `(a3, l3)` from the initial state and an additional tuple `(a3, l3)` appended by the code, `a3` is the first integer from the latest input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input**.
