The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to the list `l3`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for the input, the output state will reflect the general form of the variables after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input.**
