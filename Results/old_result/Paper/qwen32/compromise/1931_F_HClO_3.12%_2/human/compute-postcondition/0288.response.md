The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the latest input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples (`a3`, `l3`)**
