### Reasoning:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed in all cases, not removed in any case, or may be either removed or left based on the given conditions. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program first reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, `k`, and the list `a` of values on the cubes.
2. **Favorite Cube Value**: It identifies the value of the favorite cube using `favorite_value = a[f - 1]`.
3. **Counting Values**:
   - It counts `same_value_count`, the number of cubes with the same value as the favorite cube.
   - It counts `greater_count`, the number of cubes with values greater than the favorite cube.
4. **Decision Making**:
   - If `greater_count >= k`, it means there are enough cubes with higher values to ensure that the favorite cube will be removed regardless of the order of cubes with the same value. Therefore, it prints 'YES'.
   - If `greater_count + same_value_count <= k`, it means even if all cubes with values greater than or equal to the favorite cube are considered, there are not enough to exceed `k`, so the favorite cube will never be removed. Therefore, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE', indicating that the favorite cube might be removed or might not be removed depending on the order of cubes with the same value.

The logic correctly handles all scenarios as described in the problem statement. The annotated states and the explanation provided align with the code, confirming that the program is correct.
