You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

    #State: t is 0; n, f, k, a, favorite_value, same_value_count, and greater_count reflect the last test case processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines whether the number of elements in `a` that are greater than the `f`-th element (1-based index) plus the number of elements equal to the `f`-th element is sufficient to meet or exceed `k`. It prints 'YES' if the condition is met, 'NO' if it is not, and 'MAYBE' if the number of greater elements is less than `k` but the sum of greater and equal elements is more than `k`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cubes `n`, the index of the favorite cube `f`, and the number of cubes to be removed `k`.
   - It then reads the list of cube values `a`.

2. **Determine the Favorite Cube's Value**:
   - The value of the favorite cube is determined by `favorite_value = a[f - 1]` because list indices in Python are zero-based.

3. **Count Cubes with Values Greater Than and Equal to the Favorite Cube**:
   - `same_value_count` is used to count how many cubes have the same value as the favorite cube.
   - `greater_count` is used to count how many cubes have a value greater than the favorite cube.

4. **Determine the Outcome**:
   - If there are at least `k` cubes with values greater than the favorite cube (`greater_count >= k`), the favorite cube will be removed in all cases, so the program outputs "YES".
   - If the total number of cubes with values greater than or equal to the favorite cube (`greater_count + same_value_count`) is less than or equal to `k`, the favorite cube will not be removed in any case, so the program outputs "NO".
   - Otherwise, the favorite cube may be removed or left, depending on the exact arrangement, so the program outputs "MAYBE".

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic correctly identifies the scenarios where the favorite cube is definitely removed, definitely not removed, or may be either removed or left.
   - The program handles all edge cases, such as when all cubes have the same value or when the favorite cube has the maximum value.

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
