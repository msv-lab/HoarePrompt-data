Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `favorite_value` is the integer at index `f - 1` in the new list `a`. If `value` is equal to `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` is 4. Otherwise, `same_value_count` is 2. `greater_count` is the total number of elements in the new list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`. `value` is the next element in the list `a`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `same_value_count` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
