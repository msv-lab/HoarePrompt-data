Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `favorite_value` is the integer at index `f - 1` in list `a`; `same_value_count` is the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in the list `a`; `greater_count` is the total number of elements in `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`; `greater_count` is less than `k`. If the sum of `greater_count` and `same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`, then the program follows the if part. Otherwise, it follows the else part.**
