Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least one element, `favorite_value` is the integer at index `f - 1` in list `a`, `same_value_count` is 1, and `value` is equal to `favorite_value`.**

Explanation: The value of `same_value_count` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
