Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `favorite_value` is the integer at index `f - 1` in the list `a`; `same_value_count` is the total number of elements in the list `a` that are equal to `favorite_value`; `greater_count` is the total number of elements in the list `a` that are less than `k`; and the sum of `greater_count` and `same_value_count` is greater than `k`.**
