The code snippet `c = input()` assigns a new input string to the variable `c`. This new input string will overwrite the previous value of `c`, which was a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new input string, `slength` is an input integer, `i` is the value of `i` from the previous iteration plus 1.**
