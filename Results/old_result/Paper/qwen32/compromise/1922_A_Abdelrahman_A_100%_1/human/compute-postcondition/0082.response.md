Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a non-empty string, `slength` is an input integer, `i` is the value of `i` from the previous iteration plus 1, `no` is False, `counter` is 0, `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms, the output state indicates that all the variables retain their initial values, except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
