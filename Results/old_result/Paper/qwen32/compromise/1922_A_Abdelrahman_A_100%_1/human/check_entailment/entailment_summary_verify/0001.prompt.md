You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            counter = 0
            for x in c:
                if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
                counter += 1
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it checks if a given string `c` can be formed by characters from corresponding positions in strings `a` and `b`. It prints 'YES' if for every character in `c`, there is a corresponding character in either `a` or `b` at the same position, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. The template `t` consists of lowercase and/or uppercase Latin letters, and the matching rules are as follows:
- If the i-th letter of the template is lowercase, then `s_i` must be the same as `t_i`.
- If the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then `s_i` must be different from the lowercase version of `t_i`.

### Program Analysis:
The program iterates over each test case and for each test case, it performs the following steps:
1. It reads the length of the strings `n`, and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. It initializes a flag `no` to `True`, indicating that no valid template has been found yet.
3. It checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`. If so, it sets `no` to `False` and prints "NO" because if `c` matches either `a` or `b`, it cannot be different from a template that matches both `a` and `b`.
4. If `c` is not equal to `a` or `b`, it iterates over each character in `c` and checks if the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are both different from the character in `c`. If it finds such a position, it sets `no` to `False` and prints "YES", indicating that a valid template exists.
5. If the loop completes without finding a valid position, it prints "NO" because no valid template was found.

### Issues in the Program:
The main issue with the program is the logic used to determine if a valid template exists. The program incorrectly assumes that if there is any position where the character in `c` is different from the characters in `a` and `b`, then a valid template exists. However, this is not sufficient to guarantee that a valid template can be constructed for the entire string.

### Correct Logic:
To correctly determine if a valid template exists, we need to ensure that for each position `i`:
- If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` (and `b[i]`).
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, then the template can have either an uppercase letter (indicating `c[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of the template letter) or a lowercase letter (indicating `c[i]` must match the template letter).

The provided program does not correctly implement this logic for the entire string, which means it can incorrectly output "YES" in cases where no valid template exists.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a valid template exists for the entire string.

Correctness: **False**
