Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Here are the issues with the program:

1. The program checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b` and immediately prints "NO" if true. This is incorrect because the condition for "NO" should be based on whether there is a valid template that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.

2. The loop that checks if there is a valid template is flawed. It checks if each character in `c` is not in the corresponding characters of `a` and `b`, but this does not correctly determine if a template exists where `a` and `b` match and `c` does not. For example, if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and `c[i]` is different, this does not necessarily mean that a valid template exists.

To correctly solve the problem, for each position `i` from 1 to `n`, the program should determine if there is a valid character for the template based on the characters in `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]`. Specifically:
- If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `t[i]` must be the uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`), and `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]`.
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, then `t[i]` can be either the uppercase version of `a[i]` or `b[i]`, and `c[i]` must not match both `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for _ in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        valid = True
        for i in range(slength):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                if c[i] == a[i]:
                    valid = False
                    break
            else:
                if c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
                    valid = False
                    break
        print('YES' if valid else 'NO')

func()
```

This corrected program checks each position `i` and ensures that a valid template can be constructed such that `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not.
