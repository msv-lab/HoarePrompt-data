You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    a
    
    b

    adhoccoder

    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            counter = 0
            for x in c:
                if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
                counter += 1
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it checks if a given string `c` can be formed by characters from corresponding positions in strings `a` and `b`. It prints 'YES' if for every character in `c`, there is a corresponding character in either `a` or `b` at the same position, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Let's analyze the issues in the code:

1. **Incorrect Matching Logic**:
   - The program checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b` and if so, prints "NO". This is correct because if `c` is exactly the same as `a` or `b`, there can't be a template where `a` and `b` match while `c` does not.
   - However, the logic for determining if there exists a template where `a` and `b` match while `c` does not is flawed. The program checks if any character in `c` is not in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b` and concludes "YES" if so. This is incorrect because the template can have both lowercase and uppercase letters, and the program does not consider this flexibility.

2. **Template Flexibility**:
   - The template can have lowercase letters (which must match the corresponding characters in `a` and `b`) or uppercase letters (which must not match the corresponding characters in `a` and `b`).
   - The program does not attempt to construct such a template. Instead, it incorrectly assumes that if any character in `c` does not match the corresponding characters in `a` and `b`, then a valid template exists.

3. **Example Counter Case**:
   - Consider the following input:
     ```
     1
     3
     abc
     abc
     def
     ```
   - According to the problem description, the template "ABC" would make `a` and `b` match while `c` does not, so the correct output should be "YES". However, the program will incorrectly output "NO" because it doesn't correctly handle the template logic.

4. **Another Example**:
   - Consider:
     ```
     1
     2
     ab
     cd
     ef
     ```
   - Here, the template "AB" would make `a` match while `b` and `c` do not, so the correct output should be "YES". However, the program will incorrectly output "NO" because it doesn't correctly handle the template logic.

To fix the program, we need to construct a template that satisfies the conditions for `a` and `b` while not satisfying them for `c`. This requires checking each position and determining if it should be a lowercase or uppercase letter in the template.
