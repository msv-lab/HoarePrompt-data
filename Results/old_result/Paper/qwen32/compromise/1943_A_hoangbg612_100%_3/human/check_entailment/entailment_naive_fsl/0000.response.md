Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob to maximize and minimize the MEX of the array `c`, respectively. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the MEX by iterating through the sorted array and keeping track of the counts of each number in a dictionary `M`. However, it does not correctly account for the optimal moves by Alice and Bob.

2. **Handling of Duplicates**: The program does not correctly handle cases where there are multiple occurrences of the same number. Alice and Bob's strategies should consider the parity (odd or even) of the count of each number to determine the optimal moves, but the program does not do this.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where all elements are the same or where the array contains only zeros.

Let's consider a specific test case to illustrate the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
2
3
0 0 0
3
0 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
3
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
0
1
```

**Explanation of the Issue:**

- For the first test case `3 0 0 0`, the optimal strategy should result in the MEX being `1`. The program incorrectly outputs `0` because it does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob will play optimally, and Alice can force the MEX to be `1` by her strategy.
  
- For the second test case `3 0 1 2`, the optimal strategy should result in the MEX being `3`. The program correctly outputs `1` for this case, but this is not a guarantee of correctness.

The program needs to correctly simulate the optimal moves by Alice and Bob, taking into account the parity of counts and the strategic choices they make to maximize or minimize the MEX. The current implementation does not achieve this.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
