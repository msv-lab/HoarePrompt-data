The code snippet provided reads an integer `T` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The initial state describes multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The code only reads the number of test cases `T` and does not process the subsequent lines of input.

Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases. The initial state about the test cases (each with an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers) remains unchanged.**
