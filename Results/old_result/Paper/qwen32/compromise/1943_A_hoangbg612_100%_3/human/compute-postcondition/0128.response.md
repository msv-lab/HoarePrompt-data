The value of `cur` is updated to the value of `num`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`M` is a dictionary, `cur` is the value of `num`, `cnt` is a list, `T` is decremented by 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must contain at least one integer, and `num` is the next element in `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, then `cur` is incremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cur`.**
