Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `M` is an empty dictionary, `cur` is -1, `cnt` is a list containing all keys from `M` where the value is 1 (which is an empty list since `M` is empty), `T` is decremented by 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input.
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `M` is a dictionary, `cur` is an integer, `cnt` is a list, `T` is decremented by 1, `S` is an input integer, and `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must contain at least one integer. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `M` is `{num: 1}`, `cur` is `num`, and `cnt` is `[num]`. Otherwise, if `num` is less than or equal to `cur`, then `M` is `{-1: 1}`, `cur` is `-1`, and `cnt` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `M` is a dictionary, `cur` is an integer, `cnt` is a list, `T` is decremented by 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must contain at least one integer, and `num` is the next element in `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, `M` includes an additional entry `cur: 1` if `cur` was not already a key in `M`, and if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is incremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the value at key `cur` in `M` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `M` is a dictionary, `cur` is an integer, `cnt` is a list, `T` is decremented by 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must contain at least two integers, and `num` is the next element in `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `M` is updated to have `cur` as a key with a value of 1 and `cur` is set to the next element in `N`. Otherwise, the value of `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
