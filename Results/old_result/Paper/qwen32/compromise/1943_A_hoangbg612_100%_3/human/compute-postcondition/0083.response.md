The value of `cur` is updated to the value of `num`. The values of `T`, `S`, `N`, and `num` remain unchanged. Since `cur` is directly assigned the value of `num`, no other conditions or operations affect the other variables.

Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is `num`.**
