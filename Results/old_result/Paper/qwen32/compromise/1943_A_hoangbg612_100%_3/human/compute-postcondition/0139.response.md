Postcondition: **`M` is a dictionary, `cur` is an integer, `cnt` is a list, `T` is decremented by 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must contain at least two integers, and `num` is the next element in `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `M` is updated to have `cur` as a key with a value of 1 and `cur` is set to the next element in `N`. Otherwise, the value of `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**
