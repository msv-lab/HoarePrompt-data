The only object in the loop head is the variable `k`, which iterates over the keys of the dictionary `M`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we only need to adjust `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `k` was some key from the dictionary `M`. Since the loop iterates over all keys in `M`, at the start of the next iteration, `k` should be the next key in the iteration sequence of `M.keys()`.

Given that `M` is a dictionary with at least one key, and the loop has just completed an iteration, we assume that there are more keys left in `M` for the loop to process.

State: **`T` is unchanged, `cur` is unchanged, `S` is unchanged, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key, `k` is the next key in `M.keys()`**
