Postcondition: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element; `cur` is either -1 or the value of `num` if `num` was greater than `cur`; `M` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is either `-1` or `cur` and the value is `1`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, `cur` is updated to `num` and `M` is updated to have `num` as the key with the value `1`. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1 and `M` has `-1` as the key with the value `1`.**
