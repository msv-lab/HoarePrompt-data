Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements; `num` is the next element in the list `N`; `cur` is now equal to `num`.**

In natural language: The value of `cur` is updated to be equal to `num`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
