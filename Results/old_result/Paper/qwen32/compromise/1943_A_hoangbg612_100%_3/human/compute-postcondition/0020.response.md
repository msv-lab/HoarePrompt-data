The code snippet provided is simply a `break` statement, which will terminate the innermost loop or conditional block it is contained within. However, since no loop or conditional block is provided in the context, the `break` statement does not affect any variables directly. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element; `cur` is either 0 or `num + 1`; `M` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is either `-1` or `cur - 1` and the value is `1`; `num` is the next element in the list `N` after the current `num`.**
