Postcondition: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements; `num` is the next element in the list `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num` and `M[cur]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**
