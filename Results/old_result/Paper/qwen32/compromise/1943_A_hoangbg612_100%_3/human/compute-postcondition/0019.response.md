The code snippet `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. Given the initial state, `cur` can either be -1 or the value of `num` if `num` was greater than `cur`. After the increment, if `cur` was initially -1, it becomes 0. If `cur` was the value of `num`, it becomes `num + 1`.

The other variables (`T`, `S`, `N`, `M`, `num`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element; `cur` is either 0 or `num + 1`; `M` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is either `-1` or `cur - 1` and the value is `1`; `num` is the next element in the list `N` after the current `num`.**
