The code snippet provided is a `break` statement, which will terminate the execution of the innermost loop or if statement it is contained within. However, the `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `T`, `S`, `N`, `num`, or `cur`. The only change specified in the initial state is that `cur` is increased by 1, so we will reflect that in our output state.

Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements; `num` is the next element in the list `N`; `cur` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
