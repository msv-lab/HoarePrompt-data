The code snippet appends the key `k` to the list `cnt`. The values of `T`, `cur`, `S`, and `M` remain unchanged. The value of `M[k]` is still 1. The list `cnt` now contains the key `k` as its first and only element.

Output State: **`T` is unchanged, `cur` is unchanged, `S` is unchanged, `cnt` is a list containing `k`, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key where `M[k]` is 1.**
