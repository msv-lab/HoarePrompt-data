Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element; `cur` is 0; `M` is an empty dictionary; `num` is greater than `cur + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `T`, `S`, `N`, `cur`, `M`, and `num` do not change. The only impact of the code is that it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
