Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is `cur + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `T`, `S`, `N`, `num`, and `cur` remain unchanged except for `cur` which is incremented by 1. However, the code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
