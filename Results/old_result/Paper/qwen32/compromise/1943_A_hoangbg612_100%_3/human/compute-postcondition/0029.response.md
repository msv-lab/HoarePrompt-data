Postcondition: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements; `num` is the next element in the list `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cur` and the loop or if statement continues.**
