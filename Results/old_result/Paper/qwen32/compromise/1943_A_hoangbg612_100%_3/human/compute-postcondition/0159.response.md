To determine the output of the `print(cur)` statement, let's break down the given initial state step by step:

1. **M is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from N and values as their counts**:
   - M maps each unique integer from the list N to the number of times it appears in N.

2. **cnt is a list containing all keys from M where the value is 1**:
   - cnt is a list of integers from M that appear exactly once in N.

3. **cur is the second element of cnt if the length of cnt is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise cur remains unchanged**:
   - If cnt has at least two elements, cur is set to the second element of cnt.
   - If cnt has fewer than two elements, cur retains its original value (which is not specified in the initial state, so it could be anything, but based on the logic, we assume it wouldn't be printed in that case).

4. **T is decremented by the number of keys in M**:
   - This step does not affect the value of cur, so we can ignore it for determining the output of `print(cur)`.

5. **S is the input integer**:
   - S is not used in determining the value of cur, so we can ignore it for this purpose.

6. **N is the sorted list of integers from the input**:
   - N is a sorted list of integers, but its specific values are not given, so we can't determine the exact value of cur without knowing the input.

Given the above steps, the value of `cur` depends on the contents of the list `cnt`. Since `cnt` contains keys from `M` that have a count of 1, and `cur` is the second element of `cnt` if `cnt` has at least two elements, the output of `print(cur)` will be the second unique integer in the sorted list `N` that appears exactly once.

However, without the specific input values, we can only describe `cur` in terms of the conditions provided.

Output: **cur (where cur is the second element of the list cnt, which contains keys from M with a count of 1, if cnt has at least two elements)**
