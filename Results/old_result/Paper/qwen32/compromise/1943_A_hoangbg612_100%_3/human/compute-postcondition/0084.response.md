The code snippet `M[cur] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. The variables `T`, `S`, `N`, `num`, and `cur` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is `num`, `M[cur]` is `1`.**

In natural language: The value of `cur` (which is the next element in the sorted list `N`) is now a key in the dictionary `M` with the value `1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
