The code snippet `cnt.append(k)` appends the value of `k` to the list `cnt`.

Given the initial state:
- `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair.
- `cur` is determined based on the sum of the counts in `M` being equal to `S`.
- `cnt` is an empty list.
- `T` is decremented by 1.
- `S` is the input integer.
- `N` is the sorted list of integers from the input.
- `M[k]` is equal to 1.

The only change made by the code is that `k` is added to the list `cnt`. Therefore, `cnt` is no longer empty but contains the element `k`.

Output State: **`M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `cur` is the last integer in `N` plus 1 if the sum of the counts in `M` is equal to `S`, otherwise `cur` remains the last integer in `N`, `cnt` is a list containing `k`, `T` is decremented by 1, `S` is the input integer, `N` is the sorted list of integers from the input, `M[k]` is equal to 1.**
