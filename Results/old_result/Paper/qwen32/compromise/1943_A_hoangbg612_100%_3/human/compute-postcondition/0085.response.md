The code snippet provided increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. Given the initial state, the variables `T`, `S`, `N`, and `num` are not affected by this operation. The only change is in the value of `M[cur]`.

Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the next element in `N`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `M[cur]` has been increased by 1. All other variables (`T`, `S`, `N`, and `num`) remain unchanged.
