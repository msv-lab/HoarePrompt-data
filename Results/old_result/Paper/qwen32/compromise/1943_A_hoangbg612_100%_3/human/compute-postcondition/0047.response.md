The code `cnt.append(k)` appends the value of `k` to the list `cnt`. The values of `T`, `cur`, `S`, and `M` remain unchanged. The value of `k` is the next key in `M.keys()` after the current `k`. If `M[k] == 1`, then `cnt` will have an additional element `k` appended to it. Otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged. However, since the code explicitly appends `k` to `cnt`, we can conclude that `cnt` will definitely have `k` appended to it.

Output State: **`T` is unchanged, `cur` is unchanged, `S` is unchanged, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key, `k` is the next key in `M.keys()` after the current `k`, `cnt` has an additional element `k` appended to it.**
