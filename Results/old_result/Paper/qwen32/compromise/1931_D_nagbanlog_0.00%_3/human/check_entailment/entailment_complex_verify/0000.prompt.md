You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

    #The program returns `results`, which is a list containing the final `beautiful_count` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it calculates the number of "beautiful pairs" based on specific modular conditions and returns a list of these counts for all test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find pairs of indices \((i, j)\) such that:
- \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
- \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

### Program Analysis:
The program uses a frequency dictionary to keep track of pairs of remainders when elements are divided by \(x\) and \(y\). For each element in the array, it calculates the required remainder to form a beautiful pair and checks if such a pair has been seen before. If so, it increments the count of beautiful pairs.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the logic:
1. For each element `num` in the array `a`, compute `mod_x = num % x` and `mod_y = num % y`.
2. Compute `required_mod_x` which is the value needed to make the sum of `num` and another number divisible by `x`. This is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`.
3. The `required_mod_y` is simply `mod_y` because we need the difference to be divisible by `y`, and the same remainder modulo `y` will satisfy this condition.
4. Check if the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the frequency dictionary `freq`. If it does, increment the `beautiful_count` by the frequency of this pair.
5. Update the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(mod_x, mod_y)`.

### Potential Issues:
The main issue lies in the calculation of `required_mod_x`. The current implementation uses `(x - mod_x) % x`, which is incorrect for finding pairs where the sum is divisible by `x`. Instead, we need to find pairs where `(mod_x + other_mod_x) % x == 0`. This means `other_mod_x` should be `(-mod_x) % x`.

### Correct Calculation:
The correct way to calculate `required_mod_x` is:
```python
required_mod_x = (-mod_x) % x
```

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the provided program is incorrect due to the wrong calculation of `required_mod_x`.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
4 3 2
1 2 4 5
```
- For `a[0] = 1`, `mod_x = 1`, `mod_y = 1`. The required pair would be `(2, 1)` (since `(1 + 2) % 3 == 0`), but the program calculates `required_mod_x` as `(3 - 1) % 3 = 2`.
- For `a[1] = 2`, `mod_x = 2`, `mod_y = 0`. The required pair would be `(1, 0)` (since `(2 + 1) % 3 == 0`), but the program calculates `required_mod_x` as `(3 - 2) % 3 = 1`.
- For `a[2] = 4`, `mod_x = 1`, `mod_y = 0`. The required pair would be `(2, 0)` (since `(1 + 2) % 3 == 0`), but the program calculates `required_mod_x` as `(3 - 1) % 3 = 2`.
- For `a[3] = 5`, `mod_x = 2`, `mod_y = 1`. The required pair would be `(1, 1)` (since `(2 + 1) % 3 == 0`), but the program calculates `required_mod_x` as `(3 - 2) % 3 = 1`.

In this case, the pairs `(1, 2)` and `(2, 1)` should be counted, but the program will not count them correctly.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program incorrectly calculates `required_mod_x` which leads to incorrect counting of beautiful pairs. The correct calculation should be `required_mod_x = (-mod_x) % x`.
