The given code snippet increments the `beautiful_count` variable by the value associated with the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a)
- `results` is a list containing `beautiful_count`
- `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first three elements of `case['params']`
- `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element
- `freq` is a dictionary that contains the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)`
- `beautiful_count` is 0
- `mod_x` is `n % x`
- `mod_y` is `n % y`
- `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`
- `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`
- The current value of `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists as a key in `freq`.

After executing the line `beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, the value of `beautiful_count` will be updated to its current value plus the value stored in `freq` under the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing `beautiful_count`, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first three elements of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary that contains the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)`, `beautiful_count` is `beautiful_count + freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]`, `mod_x` is `n % x`, `mod_y` is `n % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.**
