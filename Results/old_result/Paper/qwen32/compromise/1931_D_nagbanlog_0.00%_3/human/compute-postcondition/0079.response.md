The given code snippet assigns the value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the only change is the assignment of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a); `results` is a list containing `beautiful_count` which is incremented by `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in `freq`; `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`; `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first three elements of `case['params']`; `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element; `freq` is a dictionary with the count of `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1, and includes the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` with a value of 0 if it was not already present; `num` is the next element in `a`; `mod_x` is `num % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`; `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.**
