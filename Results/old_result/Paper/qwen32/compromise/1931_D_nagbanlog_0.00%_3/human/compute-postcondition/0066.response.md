Given the provided initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the new state after executing the code.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a)
- `results` is a list containing `beautiful_count`
- `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first three elements of `case['params']`
- `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element
- `freq` is a dictionary with the count of `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1
- `mod_x` is `num % x`
- `mod_y` is `n % y`
- `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`
- `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`
- `num` is the next element in `a`

Code Snippet:
```python
mod_y = num % y
```

Impact of the Code:
- The variable `mod_y` is recalculated using the current value of `num` and `y`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a); `results` is a list containing `beautiful_count`; `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`; `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first three elements of `case['params']`; `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element; `freq` is a dictionary with the count of `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1; `mod_x` is `num % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`; `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`; `num` is the next element in `a`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
After executing the code, the variable `mod_y` is updated to the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`. All other variables retain their previous values.
