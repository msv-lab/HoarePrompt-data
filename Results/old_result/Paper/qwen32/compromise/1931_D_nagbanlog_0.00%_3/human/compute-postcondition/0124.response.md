Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

- `t`: An integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
- `test_cases`: A list of at least one test case, where each test case is a tuple `(n, x, y, a)`.
- `results`: A list that stores the final `beautiful_count` for each test case.
- `case`: The next test case in `test_cases`. This is a dictionary with keys `'params'` and `'array'`.
- `n`: The first element of `case['params']`.
- `x`: The second element of `case['params']`.
- `y`: The third element of `case['params']`.
- `a`: The array associated with the current test case, i.e., `case['array']`.
- `freq`: A dictionary that keeps track of the frequency of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)`.
- `num`: The next element in the list `a`.
- `mod_x`: The result of `num % x`.
- `mod_y`: The result of `num % y`.
- `required_mod_x`: The result of `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y`: The result of `mod_y`.

### Print Statement Analysis:

The print statement is:
```python
print(
    f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
)
```

### Variable Values:

- `num`: The current number being processed from the array `a`.
- `mod_x`: The remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
- `mod_y`: The remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
- `required_mod_x`: The value needed to make `num + required_mod_x` a multiple of `x`. It is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y`: The value needed to make `num + required_mod_y` a multiple of `y`. Since `required_mod_y` is simply `mod_y`, it remains unchanged.

### Output Description:

Given the above breakdown, the print statement will output the current number `num`, its remainders when divided by `x` and `y` (`mod_x` and `mod_y` respectively), and the values needed to make `num` a multiple of `x` and `y` (`required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` respectively).

### Final Output Format:

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [mod_y] (where num is the current number, mod_x is num % x, mod_y is num % y, required_mod_x is (x - mod_x) % x, and required_mod_y is mod_y)**

This format ensures that the output is precise and provides a clear understanding of the values being printed based on the given initial state.
