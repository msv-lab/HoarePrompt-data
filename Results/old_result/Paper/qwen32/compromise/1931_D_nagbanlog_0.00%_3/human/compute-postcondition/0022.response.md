The given code snippet assigns the value of `num % y` to the variable `mod_y`. This means that `mod_y` will now hold the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.

Given the initial state, `num` is the next element in the list `a` if it exists, and `y` is a value extracted from `case['params']`. Since the exact values of `num` and `y` are not specified, we can only express `mod_y` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the values extracted from `case['params']`, `a` is the list of integers from `case['array']`, `freq` is a dictionary with the count of the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `num` is the next element in `a` if it exists.**

In simpler terms, `mod_y` is now set to the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
