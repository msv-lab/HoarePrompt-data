To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the context and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case, where each test case is a tuple `(n, x, y, a)`.
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `n`, `x`, and `y` are extracted from `case['params']`.
   - `a` is the list of integers from `case['array']`.
   - `freq` is a dictionary with the count of the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1.
   - `mod_x` is `num % x`.
   - `mod_y` is `num % y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.
   - `num` is the next element in `a` if it exists.

2. **Variables in the Print Statement**:
   - `num`: This is the current number being processed from the list `a`.
   - `mod_x`: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
   - `mod_y`: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
   - `required_mod_x`: This is the required remainder when `num` is adjusted to meet a certain condition modulo `x`. It is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y`: This is the same as `mod_y`.

Given this information, the print statement will output the current `num`, its remainders when divided by `x` and `y`, and the calculated `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y`.

### Example Calculation
Let's assume the following values for clarity:
- `num = 7`
- `x = 3`
- `y = 4`

Then:
- `mod_x = 7 % 3 = 1`
- `mod_y = 7 % 4 = 3`
- `required_mod_x = (3 - 1) % 3 = 2`
- `required_mod_y = 3`

### Output
The print statement will output:
```
Number: 7, mod_x: 1, mod_y: 3, required_mod_x: 2, required_mod_y: 3
```

### General Output
Since the exact values of `num`, `x`, and `y` are not provided, we can generalize the output as follows:

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y] (where num is the current number from the list a, mod_x is num % x, mod_y is num % y, required_mod_x is (x - mod_x) % x, and required_mod_y is mod_y)**
