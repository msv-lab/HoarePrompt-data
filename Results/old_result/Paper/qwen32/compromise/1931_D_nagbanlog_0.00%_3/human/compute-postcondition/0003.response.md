The code snippet assigns the value of `case['array']` to the variable `a`. This means that `a` now holds the list of integers specified in the `case['array']` field of the current test case.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a) with 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the values extracted from `case['params']`, `a` is the list of integers from `case['array']`.**
