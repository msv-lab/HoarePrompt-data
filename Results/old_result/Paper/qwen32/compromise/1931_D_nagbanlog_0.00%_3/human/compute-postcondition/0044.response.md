The given code snippet appends the value of `beautiful_count` to the `results` list. No other variables are modified in the provided code snippet.

Therefore, the only change in the output state is that `results` now contains the value of `beautiful_count`. All other variables retain their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing `beautiful_count`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the values extracted from `case['params']`, `a` is the list of integers from `case['array']`, `freq` is a dictionary with the count of each unique tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` for all elements in `a`, `beautiful_count` is the total number of pairs of elements in `a` that satisfy the condition `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq`.**
