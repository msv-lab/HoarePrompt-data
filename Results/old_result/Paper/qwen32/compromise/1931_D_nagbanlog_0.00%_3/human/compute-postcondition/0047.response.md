The code assigns the value of `case['array']` to the variable `a`. This means that `a` now holds the array from the current test case.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing `beautiful_count`, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first three elements of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']`.**
