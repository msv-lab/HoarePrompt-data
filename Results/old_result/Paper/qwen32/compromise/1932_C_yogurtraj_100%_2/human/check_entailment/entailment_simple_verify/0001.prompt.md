You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5 and 1 <= m <= 10^4. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^4. s is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5.

    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial integer input. For each test case, the variables `n`, `m`, `a`, and `t` are read from the input. The list `y` is computed for each test case and printed. The final values of `k`, `q1`, and `q2` are determined by the last iteration of the inner loop for each test case. The variables `ii`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `t` retain their values from the last test case processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the product of the elements in the array `a` modulo `m` after each command is processed. However, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. **Initialization of `k`, `q1`, and `q2`:** The logic for initializing `k`, `q1`, and `q2` is incorrect. The variable `k` is supposed to hold the product of all elements modulo `m` at the start, but the initialization based on the last command is not correct. Similarly, `q1` and `q2` are not correctly initialized to point to the elements that should be included in the product calculation.

2. **Loop to calculate the product:** The loop that calculates the product of the elements in reverse order based on the commands is flawed. The indices `q1` and `q2` are not correctly updated to reflect the elements that should be included in the product calculation after each command.

3. **Command processing:** The program does not correctly process the commands in the order they are given. It tries to process the commands in reverse order, which is not aligned with the problem statement.

4. **Edge cases:** The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when the array has only one element or when all commands are the same.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for ii in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        t = input()
        
        # Calculate the product of all elements modulo m
        product = 1
        for num in a:
            product = (product * num) % m
        
        # Initialize the result list
        y = []
        
        # Process each command
        left_index = 0
        right_index = n - 1
        for command in t:
            y.append(product)
            if command == 'L':
                product = (product * pow(a[left_index], m - 2, m)) % m  # Remove leftmost element
                left_index += 1
            else:
                product = (product * pow(a[right_index], m - 2, m)) % m  # Remove rightmost element
                right_index -= 1
        
        print(*y)

# Call the function to process input
func()
```

In this corrected version:
- The product of all elements modulo `m` is calculated first.
- The product is updated by removing the leftmost or rightmost element based on the command, using modular multiplicative inverse for division.
- The result is stored in the list `y` and printed at the end.

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness of the original program is:

Correctness: **False**
