Postcondition: **`t` is an input string, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer from input and must be at least 2, `m` is an integer from input, `a` is a list of integers from the input line, `l` is the count of 'L' in `t`. The character at index `i` of `t` is not 'R'. If the last character of `t` is 'L', then `k` is `a[l - 1] % m`, `q1` is `l - 2`, and `q2` is `l`. Otherwise, `k` is `a[l] % m`, `q1` is `l - 1`, and `q2` is `l + 1`. `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element being `k`**
