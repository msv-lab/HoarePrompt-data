Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the new input string, `ii` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a new list of integers from the latest input line, `l` is the count of 'L' in the new `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element updated to `k`, `i` is 0. If the last character of `t` is 'L', then `k` is `a[l - 1] % m`, `q1` is `l - 2`, and `q2` is `l`. Otherwise, `k` is `a[l] % m`, `q1` is `l - 1`, and `q2` is `l + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
    if t[i] == 'R':
        k = k * a[q2] % m
        q2 += 1
    else:
        k = k * a[q1] % m
        q1 -= 1
    y[i] = k


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The first element of `y` is now `k`, while the last element of `y` remains `k`. All other variables retain their initial values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The first element of `y` is now either `k * a[q2] % m` if `t[i] == 'R'`, or `k * a[q1+1] % m` otherwise, and the last element of `y` remains the same as the first element. The element at index `n-3` of `y` is now `k`. `i` is `n-3`, `n` remains the same. If `t[i] == 'R'`, then `q2` is incremented by 1. If `t[i] != 'R'`, then `k` is updated to `k * a[q1+1] % m` and `q1` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The first element of `y` is now either `k * a[q2] % m` if `t[i] == 'R'`, or `k * a[q1] % m` otherwise, and the last element of `y` remains the same as the first element. The element at index `n-3` of `y` is `k`. The element at index `n-4` of `y` is now `k`. `i` is `n-4`, and `n` remains the same. If `t[i] == 'R'`, then `q2` is incremented by 1. If `t[i] != 'R'`, then `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m` and `q1` is decreased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
