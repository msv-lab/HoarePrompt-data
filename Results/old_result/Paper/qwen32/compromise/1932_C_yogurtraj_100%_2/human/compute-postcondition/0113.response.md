Output State: **The first element of `y` is now `k * a[q2] % m`, while the last element of `y` remains `k * a[q2] % m`. All other variables retain their initial values, `i` is `n-3`, `n` remains the same.**

In natural language: The value of `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m`. Consequently, the first and last elements of the list `y` are now equal to this new value of `k`. All other variables, including `i` and `n`, retain their initial values.
