Postcondition: **`t` is the new input string, `ii` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input line, `l` is the count of 'L' in the new `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where each element `y[i]` is the value of `k` after processing the character at index `i` in the new `t`. If the last character of `t` is 'L', then `k` is set to `a[l - 1] % m`, `q1` is set to `l - 2`, and `q2` is set to `l`. Otherwise, `k` is set to `a[l] % m`, `q1` is set to `l - 1`, and `q2` is set to `l + 1`.**
