The code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The values of `t`, `ii`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer from input, `m` is an integer from input, `a` is a list of integers from the input line.**
