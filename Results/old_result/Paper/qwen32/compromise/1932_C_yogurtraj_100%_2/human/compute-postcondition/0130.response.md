Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `m`, a list of `n` integers `a`, and a string `s` of length `n` containing 'L' and 'R'. For each test case, it computes a list `y` of length `n` based on the values in `a` and the direction indicators in `s`, and prints the list `y`.**
