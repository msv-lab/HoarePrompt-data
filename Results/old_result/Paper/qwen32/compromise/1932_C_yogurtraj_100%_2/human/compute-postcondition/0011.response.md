The code snippet assigns the value of `l` to `q2`. Therefore, `q2` will now hold the same value as `l`, which is the count of 'L' in the input string `t`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input string that ends with 'L', `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer from input, `m` is an integer from input, `a` is a list of integers from the input line, `l` is the count of 'L' in `t`, `k` is `a[l - 1] % m`, `q1` is `l - 2`, `q2` is `l`.**
