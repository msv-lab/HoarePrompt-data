Based on the initial state provided, we know that the list `y` is fully populated with the computed values of `k` for each index from `0` to `n-2`. The variables `i`, `k`, `q1`, and `q2` have their final values, but the exact values of these variables are not specified. Similarly, other variables such as `t`, `ii`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `l` remain unchanged but their specific values are not given.

The `print(*y)` statement will print all the elements of the list `y` separated by spaces. Since `y` is fully populated with the computed values of `k` for each index from `0` to `n-2`, the printed output will be these values.

Given that the exact values of `y` are not specified in the initial state, we can only describe the output as the elements of the list `y`. 

Output: **the elements of the list y (where y is fully populated with the computed values of k for each index from 0 to n-2)**
