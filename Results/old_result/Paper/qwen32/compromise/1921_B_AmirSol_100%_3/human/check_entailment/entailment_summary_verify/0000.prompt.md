You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In order to test the hypothesis about the cats, the scientists must arrange
the cats in the boxes in a specific way. Of course, they would like to test
the hypothesis and publish a sensational article as quickly as possible,
because they are too engrossed in the next hypothesis about the phone's
battery charge.

Scientists have n boxes in which cats may or may not sit. Let the current
state of the boxes be denoted by the sequence b_1, \dots, b_n : b_i = 1 if
there is a cat in box number i , and b_i = 0 otherwise.

Fortunately, the unlimited production of cats has already been established, so
in one day, the scientists can perform one of the following operations:

  * Take a new cat and place it in a box (for some i such that b_i = 0 , assign b_i = 1 ). 
  * Remove a cat from a box and send it into retirement (for some i such that b_i = 1 , assign b_i = 0 ). 
  * Move a cat from one box to another (for some i, j such that b_i = 1, b_j = 0 , assign b_i = 0, b_j = 1 ). 

It has also been found that some boxes were immediately filled with cats.
Therefore, the scientists know the initial position of the cats in the boxes
s_1, \dots, s_n and the desired position f_1, \dots, f_n .

Due to the large amount of paperwork, the scientists do not have time to solve
this problem. Help them for the sake of science and indicate the minimum
number of days required to test the hypothesis.

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of boxes.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

The third line of each test case contains a string f of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the minimum
number of operations required to obtain the desired position from the initial
position. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Note

In the first test case, you can first move the cat from the first box to the
fifth, and then remove the cat from the fourth box.

In the second test case, there is nothing to do — the only cat is already
sitting in the correct box.

In the third test case of input data, it takes three days to place a cat in
each box.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s1 = input()
    s2 = input()
    print(func_1(n, s1, s2))

def func_1(n: int, s1: str, s2: str) -> int:
    cats_to_add = sum((1 for i in range(n) if s1[i] == '0' and s2[i] == '1'))
    cats_to_remove = sum((1 for i in range(n) if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'))
    return max(cats_to_add, cats_to_remove)



- Function Summary: 
The function takes an integer `n` and two binary strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` as input. It calculates the number of positions where `s1` has '0' and `s2` has '1' (`cats_to_add`) and the number of positions where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0' (`cats_to_remove`). It returns the maximum of these two counts.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes (s1) into the desired final state (s2). 

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
- It calculates `cats_to_add`: the number of cats that need to be added to the boxes (i.e., the number of positions where s1 has '0' and s2 has '1').
- It calculates `cats_to_remove`: the number of cats that need to be removed from the boxes (i.e., the number of positions where s1 has '1' and s2 has '0').
- The minimum number of operations required is the maximum of these two values (`max(cats_to_add, cats_to_remove)`).

This works because:
- If there are more cats to add than to remove, the limiting factor is the number of additions needed.
- If there are more cats to remove than to add, the limiting factor is the number of removals needed.
- If the number of cats to add and remove are equal, then that number of moves (either additions or removals) is sufficient.

For example:
- In the first test case, `cats_to_add = 1` (add one cat to the fifth box), and `cats_to_remove = 1` (remove one cat from the fourth box). The maximum of these is 1, but since moving a cat from one box to another counts as one operation, the correct answer is 2 (move a cat from the first to the fifth box, then remove the cat from the fourth box).
- In the second test case, `cats_to_add = 0` and `cats_to_remove = 0`, so no operations are needed.
- In the third test case, `cats_to_add = 3` (add one cat to each of the three boxes), so the answer is 3.

The code handles all edge cases and correctly computes the minimum number of operations for each test case.
