Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules described. The current implementation uses the XOR operation to determine the winner based on the differences between sorted unique pile sizes, which is not the correct approach for this game.

The game described is a variant of the Nim game, where the optimal strategy can be determined using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). The player who faces a position with a Nim-sum of zero will lose if the opponent plays optimally. Conversely, the player who can force the opponent to face a Nim-sum of zero will win.

Here is the correct approach to determine the winner:
1. Calculate the Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes).
2. If the Nim-sum is zero, Bob wins (since Alice will face a losing position).
3. If the Nim-sum is non-zero, Alice wins (since she can always force Bob into a losing position).

Let's consider the correct implementation:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nim_sum = 0
        for pile in arr:
            nim_sum ^= pile
        if nim_sum == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

The provided code does not implement this logic and instead uses a different approach that does not guarantee the correct result for all cases. Therefore, the provided code is incorrect.

To illustrate, let's consider a test case:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
The Nim-sum for this case is `1 ^ 2 ^ 3 = 0`, so the correct output should be "Bob". However, the provided code will output "Alice" for this case, which is incorrect.
