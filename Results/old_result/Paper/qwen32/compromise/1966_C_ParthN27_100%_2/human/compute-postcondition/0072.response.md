Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a new list of integers from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` with a `0` prepended to it, `i` is `n-3`, and `ans` is 1 if the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is greater than 1; otherwise, `ans` is 0.**

Since the `if` and `else` parts essentially restate the same conditions and only differ in the value of `ans` based on the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, the overall postcondition can be summarized as maintaining the state of all variables except for `ans`, which is determined by the condition.
