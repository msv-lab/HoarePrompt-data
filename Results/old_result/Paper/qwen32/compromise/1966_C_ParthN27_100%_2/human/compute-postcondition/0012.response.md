The code snippet sorts the list `s` in ascending order. The initial state specifies that `s` contains all unique elements from `arr`, and this property remains unchanged after sorting. The other variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `i` are not affected by the sorting operation.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr`, `i` is `n-1`.**
