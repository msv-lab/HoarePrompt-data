Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a new list of integers from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` with a `0` prepended to it, `i` is `n-2`, and `ans` is 1 if the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is greater than 1; otherwise, `ans` is 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
