In the given task, the loop head contains the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The variable `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. The loop will iterate based on the integer value obtained from `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state so that `int(input())` returns a value greater than 0, as the loop will iterate for each test case.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains `_` and `int(input())`. Since `_` is not a variable we can directly control or adjust, the primary variable to consider is the result of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if the integer value obtained from `int(input())` is greater than 0. This integer represents the number of test cases.

3. **Adjust the State Accordingly**: To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state so that the input results in a number greater than 0. Specifically, the number of test cases `t` should be at least 1.

Given the problem description, the state before the loop should reflect that the number of test cases `t` is at least 1. The other variables (`n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) are part of the input for each test case and do not need to be adjusted in the state before the loop starts.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`t` (number of test cases) must be greater than 0**.

Since the problem specifies that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, the simplest and most straightforward adjustment is to ensure `t` is at least 1.

Final Answer:
State: **`t` is 1**.
