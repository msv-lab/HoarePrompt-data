The code snippet `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `arr[1]` is added to the set `s`. The set `s` initially contains the first element of `arr`, which is `arr[0]`. After the addition, `s` will contain both `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`, `i` is 1**.
