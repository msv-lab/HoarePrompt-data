The code snippet `ans ^= 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `ans` and `1`. This operation will flip the value of `ans` from `0` to `1` or from `1` to `0`. 

Given the initial state, `ans` is `1` if the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is greater than `1`; otherwise, `ans` is `0`. After the XOR operation, if `ans` was initially `1`, it will become `0`, and if `ans` was initially `0`, it will become `1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a new list of integers from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` with a `0` prepended to it, `i` is `n-3`, and `ans` is 0 if the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is greater than 1; otherwise, `ans` is 1.**
