The code adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Given that `i` is 0, the element at index 0 of `arr` is added to `s`. Since `s` was initially an empty set, after this operation, `s` will contain the first element of `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing the first element of `arr`, `i` is 0**.
