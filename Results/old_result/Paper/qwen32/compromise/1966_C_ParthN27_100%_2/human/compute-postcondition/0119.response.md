Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is the length of the sorted list `s` which contains unique elements from `arr` with `0` prepended, `arr` is the new list of integers from the input, `s` is a sorted list of unique elements from `arr` with `0` prepended, `i` is the integer input from the user. If `n` is 2, the program remains in the same state as the precondition. If `n` is not 2, `t` remains 1, and `ans` remains 1.**
