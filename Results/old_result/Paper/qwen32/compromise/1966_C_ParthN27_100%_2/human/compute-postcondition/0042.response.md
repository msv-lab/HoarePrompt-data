The code snippet provided takes a new list of integers as input and assigns it to the variable `arr`. This means the previous value of `arr` is replaced with the new list. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the integer value of the input, `arr` is the new list of integers from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from the original `arr` with `0` prepended to it, `i` is either 1 if `n` was 2, or the last index reached before the loop ended, and `ans` is either 0 or 1.**
