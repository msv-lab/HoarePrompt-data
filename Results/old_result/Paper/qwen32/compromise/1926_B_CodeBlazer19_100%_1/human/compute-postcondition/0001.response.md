In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range defined by the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The other variables (`n`, `grid`) are defined within each iteration of the loop and do not affect whether the loop itself can execute.

Let's analyze the loop head:

- The loop head is `for i in range(t):`, which means the loop will execute `t` times if `t` is greater than 0.
- The variables `i`, `t` are directly involved in the loop head.

Given the state before the loop starts: `t` is an integer read from input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. Since the problem states that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, this condition is already satisfied by the problem constraints.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute based on the provided state and loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100)**

This state ensures that the loop will execute as intended.
