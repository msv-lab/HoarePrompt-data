The only variable in the loop head is `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is unchanged, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `j`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1, otherwise `a` remains unchanged, `b` is 'SQUARE' if the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, otherwise `b` remains unchanged, and `j` is incremented by 1**
