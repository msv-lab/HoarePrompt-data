Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if the count of '1' in the original `s` was exactly 1, otherwise `a` remains unchanged, `b` is 'SQUARE' if the count of '1' in the original `s` was greater than 1, otherwise `b` remains unchanged, and `j` is incremented by 1.**
