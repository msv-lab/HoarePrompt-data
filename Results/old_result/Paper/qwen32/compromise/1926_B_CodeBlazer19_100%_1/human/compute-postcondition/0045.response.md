The only variable in the loop head is `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` was some value (let's denote it as `j_old`), and since the loop is about to start the next iteration, `j` would have been incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `j_old + 1`. However, since we don't know the exact value of `j_old`, we can simply denote the new value of `j` as `j + 1` (assuming `j` was the loop variable at the end of the previous iteration).

The value of `n` remains unchanged as per the given information.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`a` is either 0 or 'TRIANGLE', `n` is greater than 0, `i` remains unchanged, `t` is greater than the value of `i`, `s` is the user's input, and `b` is 'SQUARE' if `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise `b` is an empty string, `j` is `j + 1`**.

Since we don't have a specific value for `j` from the previous iteration, we express the new value of `j` as `j + 1` to indicate that it has been incremented by 1 from its previous value.
