Given the initial state that `a` is not equal to 0, we know that `a` holds some non-zero value. However, the exact value of `a` is not specified. Therefore, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `a`.

When the `print(a)` statement is executed, it will output the current value of `a`, which is any non-zero number based on the given precondition.

Output: **a (where a is a non-zero number)**
