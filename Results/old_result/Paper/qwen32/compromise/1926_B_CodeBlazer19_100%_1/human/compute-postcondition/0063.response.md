To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is either 0 or 'TRIANGLE'
- `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE'
- `n` is the input integer
- `i` remains unchanged (which means it retains its value from the previous iteration)
- `t` is greater than the value of `i`
- `j` is equal to `n`

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

In this loop, `i` is the loop variable that gets updated automatically by the `range` function. At the start of each iteration, `i` takes the next value in the sequence from 0 up to, but not including, `t`.

Since `i` remains unchanged at the end of the previous iteration, it means that the loop has just finished an iteration where `i` had a certain value. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (as per how the `range` function works), and `t` must still be greater than this new value of `i`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- `t` must remain greater than this new value of `i`.

The other variables (`a`, `b`, `n`, `j`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`a` is either 0 or 'TRIANGLE', `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE', `n` is the input integer, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` is greater than the new value of `i`, `j` is equal to `n`**
