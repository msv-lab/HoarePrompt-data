Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `a` is set to `'TRIANGLE'` because any input string had exactly one '1'.
- `b` is set to `'SQUARE'` if any input string had more than one '1', otherwise `b` remains `''`. However, since `a` is `'TRIANGLE'`, it indicates that there was exactly one '1' in the input string, so `b` must be `''`.
- `j` is equal to `n` (the number of iterations in a loop), but this variable is not used in the `print` statement.
- `a` is not `0`, which is already satisfied since `a` is `'TRIANGLE'`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(a)` statement will output the value of the variable `a`. From the initial state, we know that `a` is explicitly set to `'TRIANGLE'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(a)` statement will print the string `'TRIANGLE'`.

Output: **TRIANGLE**
