Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the newly read string from input, `a` is 'TRIANGLE', `b` is 'SQUARE' if the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, otherwise `b` is either 'SQUARE', an empty string, or unchanged, and `j` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language: The variable `a` has been explicitly set to 'TRIANGLE'. All other variables retain their initial states as described.
