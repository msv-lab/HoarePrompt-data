To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the provided code and the given conditions step-by-step.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Outer Loop (`for i in range(t)`)**: This loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. **Inner Loop (`for j in range(n)`)**: For each test case, this loop reads `n` lines of input, each representing a row of the grid.
3. **Condition Checks**:
   - If a row (`s`) has exactly one '1', `a` is set to `'TRIANGLE'`.
   - If a row (`s`) has more than one '1', `b` is set to `'SQUARE'`.
4. **Final Print Statement**:
   - If `a` is not equal to 0 (i.e., `a` is `'TRIANGLE'`), it prints `'TRIANGLE'`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `'SQUARE'`.

### Given Output States:
- After 1 iteration: `a` is an integer. If `a` is not equal to 0, then the condition `a != 0` holds true. Otherwise, `a` is 0.
- After 2 iterations: `a` is either 0 or 'TRIANGLE', `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE', `n` is the input integer, `i` remains unchanged, `t` is greater than the value of `i`, `j` is equal to `n`.
- After 3 iterations: `a` is `'TRIANGLE'` if any input string had exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0; `b` is `'SQUARE'` if any input string had more than one '1', otherwise `b` is an empty string; `j` is equal to `n`.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations (`t` iterations), the following will hold true:
- `i` will be equal to `t` because the outer loop runs `t` times.
- `a` will be `'TRIANGLE'` if any row in any test case had exactly one '1', otherwise `a` will be 0.
- `b` will be `'SQUARE'` if any row in any test case had more than one '1', otherwise `b` will be an empty string.
- `n` will be the last input integer read before the loop ends.
- `j` will be equal to `n` because the inner loop runs `n` times for each test case.

However, the final print statement inside the loop will determine the output for each test case, not the final state of the variables. The final output state after all iterations will reflect the results of each test case printed sequentially.

### Conclusion:
Since the problem asks for the output state after all executions of the loop, we need to consider the final state of the variables and the output generated for each test case.

**Output State: **The variable `i` will be equal to `t`, `a` will be `'TRIANGLE'` if any row in any test case had exactly one '1', otherwise `a` will be 0, `b` will be `'SQUARE'` if any row in any test case had more than one '1', otherwise `b` will be an empty string, `n` will be the last input integer read before the loop ends, and `j` will be equal to `n`. Each test case will print either `'TRIANGLE'` or `'SQUARE'` based on the conditions specified.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the variables will reflect the state after processing all test cases, and the output will be a series of `'TRIANGLE'` or `'SQUARE'` corresponding to each test case.
