Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape formed by the `1`s in the grid is a triangle or a square. Here's why:

1. The program checks each row individually to determine if it contains exactly one `1` or more than one `1`. If a row contains exactly one `1`, it sets `a` to `'TRIANGLE'`. If a row contains more than one `1`, it sets `b` to `'SQUARE'`.
2. This approach does not account for the specific patterns required for a triangle or a square. For example, a triangle must have rows with an increasing or decreasing number of `1`s centered around a single column, while a square must have rows with the same number of `1`s aligned at the same position from the left.
3. The program incorrectly assumes that any row with exactly one `1` indicates a triangle and any row with more than one `1` indicates a square, which is not sufficient to determine the correct shape.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to analyze the entire grid to check for the specific patterns of a triangle or a square.
