### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it against the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and then reads the `n` lines of the grid.

2. **Logic for Determining Shape:**
   - The program uses two variables `a` and `b` to store the result.
   - If any row contains exactly one '1', it sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'.
   - If any row contains more than one '1', it sets `b` to 'SQUARE'.
   - Finally, it prints `a` if it is not zero; otherwise, it prints `b`.

3. **Issues in the Logic:**
   - The program does not correctly identify the shapes based on the problem's definition.
   - For a triangle, the program only checks if there is a row with exactly one '1', which is insufficient to determine a triangle shape as defined in the problem.
   - Similarly, for a square, the program only checks if there is a row with more than one '1', which is not sufficient to determine a square shape as defined in the problem.
   - The program does not check for the specific patterns required for a triangle or a square, such as the increasing number of '1's in each row for a triangle or the same number of '1's in each row for a square.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the logic, the program does not correctly determine whether the grid contains a triangle or a square based on the provided definitions.

**Correctness: False**
