### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of operations to transform the initial state of cats in boxes (`s1`) to the desired state (`s2`). The allowed operations are adding a cat to an empty box, removing a cat from a box, and moving a cat from one box to another.

The function `func_1` calculates:
- `cats_to_add`: The number of positions where there is no cat in the initial state (`s1[i] == '0'`) but there should be a cat in the desired state (`s2[i] == '1'`).
- `cats_to_remove`: The number of positions where there is a cat in the initial state (`s1[i] == '1'`) but there should not be a cat in the desired state (`s2[i] == '0'`).

The function returns the maximum of these two counts. This makes sense because:
- If `cats_to_add` is greater than `cats_to_remove`, it means we need more operations to add cats to the boxes than to remove cats.
- If `cats_to_remove` is greater than `cats_to_add`, it means we need more operations to remove cats from the boxes than to add cats.
- If they are equal, the number of operations needed to add cats and remove cats are the same, so either count can be returned.

The key insight is that the operations to add cats and remove cats are independent, but moving a cat from one box to another can be thought of as a combination of adding and removing a cat. Therefore, the maximum of the two counts is the correct answer because it accounts for the worst-case scenario where we need more operations to add or remove cats.

### Correctness:

Given the reasoning above, the function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state to the desired state.

**Correctness: True**
