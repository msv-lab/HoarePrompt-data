Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial configuration of cats in boxes (`s1`) to the desired configuration (`s2`). Here's a breakdown of how the solution works:

1. **Counting Cats to Add**: `cats_to_add` is calculated by counting the number of positions where there is no cat in the initial configuration (`s1[i] == '0'`) but there is a cat in the desired configuration (`s2[i] == '1'`). This represents the number of new cats that need to be added.

2. **Counting Cats to Remove**: `cats_to_remove` is calculated by counting the number of positions where there is a cat in the initial configuration (`s1[i] == '1'`) but there is no cat in the desired configuration (`s2[i] == '0'`). This represents the number of cats that need to be removed.

3. **Calculating Minimum Operations**: The minimum number of operations required is the maximum of `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`. This is because:
   - If there are more cats to remove than to add, the limiting factor is the removal of cats, and each removal can be paired with an addition if needed.
   - If there are more cats to add than to remove, the limiting factor is the addition of cats, and each addition can be paired with a removal if needed.
   - If they are equal, the number of operations required is simply the number of cats to add or remove.

The function `func_1` correctly implements this logic, and the program reads the input, processes each test case using this function, and prints the results.

Therefore, the program is correct.
