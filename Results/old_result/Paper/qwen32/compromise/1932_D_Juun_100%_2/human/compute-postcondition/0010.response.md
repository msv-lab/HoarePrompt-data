The only variable in the loop head is `trumps`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `trumps`. If `trumps` is not an empty list, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `trumps` is an empty list, so we need to adjust it to be a non-empty list.

State: **`trumps` is a non-empty list, `answers` is a list of strings representing pairs of cards from non-trump suits and trump suits, `suits` is unchanged**.
