### Reasoning:
The program is designed to determine if it's possible to end up with a tower of exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube from the tower. The logic in the program is based on the following observations:

1. **Addition and Removal**: Since each move can either add or remove a single cube, the net effect of `n` moves can be any integer value between `-n` and `n` (inclusive), depending on the combination of additions and removals.

2. **Parity Consideration**: The difference between `n` and `m` must be even. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, so the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of cubes alternates with each move. If the difference `n - m` is even, it is possible to reach `m` cubes from 0 cubes in `n` moves. If the difference is odd, it is not possible.

3. **Condition**: The condition `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that:
   - `n` is at least `m`, meaning there are enough moves to potentially add up to `m` cubes.
   - The difference `n - m` is even, ensuring that the parity of the number of cubes can be adjusted to exactly `m` after `n` moves.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
