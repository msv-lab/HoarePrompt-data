You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it prints 'YES' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference (`n - m`) is even; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not modify the input values but uses them to determine the output for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all possible cases. Specifically, it fails to account for scenarios where the number of moves `n` is less than the number of cubes `m`. 

Let's consider an example:

- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  2 3
  ```
- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  No
  ```
- **Actual Output:**
  ```
  NO
  ```
  This part is correct in terms of the output format, but the logic is incorrect. The program will output "NO" because `n < m` (2 < 3), but the logic should be reconsidered.

The correct logic should be that if `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves because the maximum number of cubes that can be added is `n`. Therefore, the condition `n >= m` is correct, but the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is not sufficient to cover all cases.

The correct condition should be:
- If `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`, then "YES"
- Otherwise, "NO"

However, the program only checks `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` and does not cover the scenario where `n < m`, which should always result in "NO".

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# The above logic is mostly correct, but let's add a more explicit check for n < m
def func_corrected():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n < m:
            print('NO')
        elif (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

The original program does not handle the case where `n < m` correctly, so it is incorrect.
