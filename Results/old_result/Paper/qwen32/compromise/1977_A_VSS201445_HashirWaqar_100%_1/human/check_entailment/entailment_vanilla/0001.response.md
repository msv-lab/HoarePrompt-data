Reasoning:

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove one cube in each move. We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Let's consider the possible scenarios:
- If `n < m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because the maximum number of cubes Nikita can add is `n`.
- If `n >= m`, it's possible to have `m` cubes if the difference `(n - m)` is even. This is because:
  - If `(n - m)` is even, Nikita can perform `(n - m) / 2` moves to remove cubes and the remaining moves can be used to add cubes. This way, the net effect is that he ends up with `m` cubes.
  - If `(n - m)` is odd, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because the number of add and remove operations must balance out in pairs to end up with an exact number of cubes, which is not possible with an odd difference.

The given program checks these conditions correctly. It ensures that `n` is at least `m` and that `(n - m)` is even, printing "YES" if both conditions are met and "NO" otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
