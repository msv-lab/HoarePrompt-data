### Reasoning:
The given program is designed to solve the problem by using a sliding window technique combined with the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to efficiently count the number of good subarrays.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `b_freq` is a `Counter` object that stores the frequency of each element in `b`.
   - `window_freq` is a `Counter` object that stores the frequency of the first `m` elements of `a`.
   - `matches` is calculated as the sum of the minimum frequencies of elements that are common in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`.

3. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - The program iterates over the array `a` from index `0` to `n-m-1` (inclusive).
   - For each position `i`, it checks if the current `matches` count is greater than or equal to `k`. If true, it increments the `good_subarrays` count.
   - It then updates the `matches` count by subtracting the contribution of the element that is sliding out of the window (`a[i]`) and adding the contribution of the element that is sliding into the window (`a[i+m]`).
   - The frequency of the elements in `window_freq` is updated accordingly, and any element with a frequency of `0` is removed from `window_freq`.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, the program performs a final check for the last window (`a[n-m:n]`) to see if it qualifies as a good subarray.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns the count of good subarrays for the current test case.

The program efficiently handles the sliding window updates and frequency calculations, ensuring that the solution is both correct and performs well within the given constraints.
