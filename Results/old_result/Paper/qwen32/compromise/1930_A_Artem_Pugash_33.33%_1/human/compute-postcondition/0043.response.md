The code snippet provided resets the variable `suma` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `numCases`, `i`, `numInteger`, `numbers`) are affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `numInteger` is the integer value provided by the user input, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the numbers provided by the user input in ascending order, `suma` is 0.**
