The code snippet initializes the variable `suma` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `numCases`, `i`, `numInteger`, or `numbers`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of `suma` with a value of 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is initialized by the loop, `numInteger` is the integer value provided by the user input, `numbers` is a sorted list of substrings from the user input in ascending order, `suma` is 0.**
