You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = input().split()
        numbers.sort(reverse=False)
        suma = 0
        while numbers != []:
            a = int(numbers.pop(0))
            b = int(numbers.pop(0))
            suma += min(a, b)
        print(suma)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):

            suma += min(a, b)
        
        print(suma)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` has reached the value of `numCases`, `numInteger` holds the integer value from the last iteration's user input, `numbers` is [], `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of numbers that were originally in `numbers` for the last iteration. The loop has completed all its iterations and printed the `suma` for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the score by always pairing the smallest available numbers. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the code works and why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `numInteger` (which is `2n` as per the problem statement) and then reads the list of these integers.

2. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted in ascending order using `numbers.sort(reverse=False)`. Sorting in ascending order ensures that when we pick pairs, we are always picking the smallest available numbers first.

3. **Pairing and Summing**: The program then enters a loop where it repeatedly pops the first two elements from the sorted list (which are the smallest due to sorting), calculates their minimum, adds this minimum to the score (`suma`), and continues until the list is empty.

4. **Output**: After processing all pairs for a test case, the program prints the total score.

This approach ensures that the sum of the minimums of the pairs is maximized because the smallest numbers are always paired together, which aligns with the optimal strategy described in the problem statement.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this solution handles all edge cases correctly:
- When `n=1`, there is only one pair, and the minimum of that pair is added to the score.
- When there are multiple pairs, the strategy of always picking the smallest numbers ensures the maximum possible score.
- The program handles multiple test cases efficiently within the given constraints.

Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
