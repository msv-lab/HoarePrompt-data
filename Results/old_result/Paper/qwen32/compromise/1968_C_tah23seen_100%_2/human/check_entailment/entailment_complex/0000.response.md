Reasoning:  
The given program is not correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states of the program. The function `func_1` is intended to generate an array `a` such that `a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `2 <= i <= n`. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not satisfy this condition.

The function initializes the `ans` list with all elements set to `10 ** 9` and then iteratively sets `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`. This does not guarantee that the modulo condition will be satisfied. In fact, the way it is currently implemented, it is likely that the values in `ans` will not meet the requirements of the problem.

For example, consider the first test case in the problem statement:
- Input: `4`, `2 4 1`
- Expected output: An array `a` such that `a[1] % a[0] = 2`, `a[2] % a[1] = 4`, and `a[3] % a[2] = 1`.

The provided function would not necessarily produce such an array. Instead, it would produce an array where each element is set based on a subtraction operation that does not inherently satisfy the modulo requirement.

A correct approach would be to set `a_1` to a value greater than or equal to the maximum value in `arr` (to ensure that all modulo operations can be satisfied) and then set each subsequent `a_i` to `a_{i-1} + x_i` (or some value that satisfies the modulo condition).

Therefore, the implementation of `func_1` is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
