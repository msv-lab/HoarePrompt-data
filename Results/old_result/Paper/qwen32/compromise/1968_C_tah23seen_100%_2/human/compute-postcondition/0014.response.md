Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of `n-1` integers, where each integer is between 1 and 500, inclusive, and an integer `n` representing the number of elements in the resulting list `ans`, with `n` ranging from 2 to 500. The function returns a list `ans` of `n` integers. For each index `i` from 0 to `n-2`, `ans[i]` is calculated as `1000000000 - sum(arr[i:n-1])`. The last element `ans[n-1]` is always `1000000000`.**
