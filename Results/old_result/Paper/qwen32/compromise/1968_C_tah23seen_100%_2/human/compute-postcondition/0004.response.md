The code modifies the value of `ans[i]` by setting it to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`. Given the initial state, `ans[i]` was initially 1000000000. After the operation, `ans[i]` will have a new value based on the values of `ans[i + 1]` and `arr[i]`.

Since `ans[i + 1]` was also initially 1000000000, the new value of `ans[i]` will be `1000000000 - arr[i]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500; `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the resulting array `a`, such that 2 <= n <= 500; `ans` is a list of `n` integers, each equal to 1000000000 except `ans[i]` which is `1000000000 - arr[i]`; `i` is `n - 2`**.
