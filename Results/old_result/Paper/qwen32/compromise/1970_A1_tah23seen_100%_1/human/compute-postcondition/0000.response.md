The code snippet assigns the length of the string `s` to the variable `n`. Since `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence, the length of `s` is simply the number of characters in the string. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`.**
