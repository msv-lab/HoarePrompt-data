Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `y` is 0, `x` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then `a` and `b` are both set to `l[x]` with the additional condition that if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, `a` is specifically set to `l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is specifically set to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is set to `l[x]`.**
