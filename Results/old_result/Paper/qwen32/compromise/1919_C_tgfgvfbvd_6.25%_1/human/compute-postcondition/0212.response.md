Postcondition: **`y` is any integer, `n` is greater than `y + 2`, `x` is `y + 3`. After the execution, if `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then `l[y + 3]` is set to `a` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`; otherwise, `l[y + 3]` is set to `b`. If the condition `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b` is not met, then `l[y + 3]` is set to `a` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[y + 3]`; otherwise, `l[y + 3]` is set to `b`.**
