Postcondition: **`n` is unchanged, `l` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `x` is `y + 2`. If `l[y + 2] < a` and `l[y + 2] < b`, then `a` is `l[y + 2]` if `a - l[y + 2] <= b - l[y + 2]`; otherwise, `b` is `l[y + 2]`. If `l[y + 2] >= a` or `l[y + 2] >= b`, then `a` is set to `l[y + 2]` if `a >= l[y + 2]`; otherwise, `b` is set to `l[y + 2]`.**
