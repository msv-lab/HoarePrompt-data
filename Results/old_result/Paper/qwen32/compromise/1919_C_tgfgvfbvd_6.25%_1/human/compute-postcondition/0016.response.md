To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `y` and `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is incremented by 1.
- The condition for the loop to continue is `y < n`.
- If `l[y] > l[y - 1]`, then `n` must be greater than `y + 2` and `b` is set to `l[y]`.

Let's break it down:

1. **Adjust `y`:** Since `y` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `y` should be `y + 1`.

2. **Adjust `n`:** The value of `n` depends on the condition `y < n`. From the given information, if `l[y] > l[y - 1]`, then `n` must be greater than `y + 2`. However, since we are only adjusting the state based on the loop head, we don't need to consider the specific condition involving `l[y]` and `l[y - 1]` directly. We just need to ensure that `n` is large enough to allow the loop to continue.

Given that `y` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote the new value of `y` as `y_new = y + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `y_new`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `y` is now `y + 1`.
- `n` must be greater than `y + 1`.

State: **`n` must be greater than `y + 1`, `y` is `y + 1`**
