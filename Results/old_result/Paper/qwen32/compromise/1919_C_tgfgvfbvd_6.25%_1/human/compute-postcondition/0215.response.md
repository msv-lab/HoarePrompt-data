To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the given Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `a` is the minimum value in the sublist `l[y + 1:n]`.
- `b` is the maximum value in the sublist `l[y + 1:n]`.
- `c` is the count of elements greater than both `a` and `b` encountered during the loop.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(c)
```

### Analysis:
- `a` and `b` are derived from the sublist `l[y + 1:n]`, where `y` and `n` are indices of the list `l`.
- `c` counts how many elements in `l[y + 1:n]` are greater than both `a` and `b`.

Since `a` is the minimum value in `l[y + 1:n]` and `b` is the maximum value in `l[y + 1:n]`, no element in the sublist `l[y + 1:n]` can be greater than both `a` and `b` simultaneously. This is because `a` is the smallest and `b` is the largest in that sublist.

Therefore, the count `c` of elements greater than both `a` and `b` must be zero.

### Conclusion:
The value of `c` is 0 because there cannot be any element in the sublist `l[y + 1:n]` that is greater than both the minimum (`a`) and the maximum (`b`) of that same sublist.

Output: **0**
