To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

Given Initial State:
- `y` is any integer
- `n` is greater than `y + 1`
- `x` is `y + 2`

Code Snippet:
```python
b = l[x]
```

This line of code assigns the value at index `x` of list `l` to variable `b`. Since `x` is defined as `y + 2`, the value of `b` will be `l[y + 2]`.

No other variables are modified, and the conditions on `y` and `n` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`y` is any integer, `n` is greater than `y + 1`, `x` is `y + 2`, `b` is `l[y + 2]`**.
