The code snippet `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. The other variables (`n`, `y`, `x`, `a`, `b`, and `l`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `y` is 0, `x` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is set to `l[x]`. `c` is incremented by 1.**
