Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `l` is the list of integers read from the input, `a` is `l[0]`, `y` is 3, `b` is `l[3]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.
