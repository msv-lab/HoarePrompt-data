Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is unchanged, `l` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than the previous one or 0 if no such element exists, `c` is 0, `y` is the index of the first element that is greater than the previous one or `n-1` if no such element exists.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
        if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
        c += 1
    elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
        if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    elif a >= l[x]:
        a = l[x]
    else:
        b = l[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is unchanged, `l` is unchanged, `y` must be less than `n-1`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is set to 1, and `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a` is greater than or equal to `l[x] - b`; otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` remains 0, and `a` or `b` is updated based on the conditions provided: if `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]` and `l[x]` is less than `a`. Additionally, either `l[x]` is not less than `b` or `b` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `l`, and `y` remain unchanged. `x` is `y + 2`. If `l[y + 2] > a` and `l[y + 2] > b`, then `a` is set to `l[y + 2]` if `l[y + 2] - a >= l[y + 2] - b`; otherwise, `b` is set to `l[y + 2]`. `c` is incremented by 1. If `l[y + 2] <= a` or `l[y + 2] <= b`, then `a` is set to `l[y + 2]` if `a - l[y + 2] <= b - l[y + 2]` and `l[y + 2] < a` and `l[y + 2] < b`; otherwise, `b` is set to `l[y + 2]`. If `l[y + 2] >= a` or `l[y + 2] >= b`, then `a` is set to `l[y + 2]` if `a >= l[y + 2]`; otherwise, `b` is set to `l[y + 2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `l`, and `y` remain unchanged. `x` is `y + 3`. If `l[y + 3] > a` and `l[y + 3] > b`, then `c` is incremented by 1, and either `a` is set to `l[y + 3]` if `l[y + 3] - a >= l[y + 3] - b`, or `b` is set to `l[y + 3]` otherwise. If `l[y + 3]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then if `l[y + 3] < a` and `l[y + 3] < b`, `a` is set to `l[y + 3]` if `a - l[y + 3] <= b - l[y + 3]`, or `b` is set to `l[y + 3]` otherwise. If `l[y + 3]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is set to `l[y + 3]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[y + 3]`, or `b` is set to `l[y + 3]` otherwise.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
