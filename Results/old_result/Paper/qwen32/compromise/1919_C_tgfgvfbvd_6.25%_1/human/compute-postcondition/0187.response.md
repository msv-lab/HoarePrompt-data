Postcondition: **`y` is any integer, `n` is greater than `y + 1`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is incremented by 1 and either `a` is set to `l[x]` if the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`, otherwise `b` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then if `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, either `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, or `b` is set to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] > b - l[x]`. Otherwise, if `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a >= l[x]`, or `b` is set to `l[x]` if `a < l[x]`.**
