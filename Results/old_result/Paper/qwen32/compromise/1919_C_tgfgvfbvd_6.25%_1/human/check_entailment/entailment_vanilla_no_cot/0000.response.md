Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty. The goal is to split the array into two subsequences such that the sum of penalties (number of increasing adjacent pairs) in both subsequences is minimized. The current implementation does not ensure that the subsequences are formed optimally and does not correctly calculate the penalty.

Here's a brief analysis of the issues with the program:
- The program initializes `a` and `b` but does not clearly define their roles.
- It attempts to find the first increasing pair to initialize `b`, but this does not guarantee an optimal split.
- The subsequent loop tries to update `a` and `b` based on certain conditions, but these conditions do not ensure that the subsequences are being formed optimally.
- The variable `c` is incremented only when a specific condition is met, which does not correspond to the calculation of the penalty.

To solve this problem correctly, one approach could be to use dynamic programming or greedy algorithms to find the optimal split. However, the provided code does not follow such an approach, leading to incorrect results.
