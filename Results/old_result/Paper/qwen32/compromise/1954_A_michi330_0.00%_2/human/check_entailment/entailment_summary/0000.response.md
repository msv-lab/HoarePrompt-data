### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to verify its correctness.

The problem states that Alice wants to paint a ribbon of `n` parts with `m` colors such that Bob cannot repaint up to `k` parts to make all parts the same color. The solution hinges on the following logic:

- **Case 1:** If `n <= k`, then Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, so the answer is 'NO'.
- **Case 2:** If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, then Bob can repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color. To understand this, consider that `math.ceil(n / m)` represents the minimum number of parts that must be painted with the most common color if the ribbon is divided as evenly as possible among the `m` colors. If the remaining parts (i.e., `n - math.ceil(n / m)`) are less than `k`, Bob can repaint these remaining parts to match the most common color, making all parts the same color. Therefore, the answer is 'NO'.
- **Otherwise:** If neither of the above conditions is met, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color by ensuring that no single color is used in more than `k` parts. Thus, the answer is 'YES'.

Let's verify this logic with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case (1, 1, 1):**
   - `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`
   - Since `n <= k`, the output is 'NO'. This is correct because Bob can repaint the single part to any color, making all parts the same.

2. **Second Test Case (5, 1, 1):**
   - `n = 5`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`
   - Since `m = 1`, Alice can only use one color, and Bob can repaint one part to make all parts the same color. Thus, the output is 'NO'.

3. **Third Test Case (5, 2, 1):**
   - `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 1`
   - `math.ceil(n / m) = math.ceil(5 / 2) = 3`, so `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2`, which is not less than `k`. Alice can paint the ribbon as [1, 2, 1, 2, 1], making it impossible for Bob to repaint just one part to make all parts the same color. Thus, the output is 'YES'.

4. **Fourth Test Case (5, 2, 2):**
   - `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 2`
   - `math.ceil(n / m) = math.ceil(5 / 2) = 3`, so `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2`, which is equal to `k`. Bob can repaint the two parts that are not the most common color to match the most common color, making all parts the same color. Thus, the output is 'NO'.

5. **Fifth Test Case (5, 5, 3):**
   - `n = 5`, `m = 5`, `k = 3`
   - `math.ceil(n / m) = math.ceil(5 / 5) = 1`, so `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 1 = 4`, which is not less than `k`. Alice can paint the ribbon as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], making it impossible for Bob to repaint up to three parts to make all parts the same color. Thus, the output is 'YES'.

The program correctly implements the logic described above, and the outputs match the expected results for the provided examples.

### Correctness: **True**
