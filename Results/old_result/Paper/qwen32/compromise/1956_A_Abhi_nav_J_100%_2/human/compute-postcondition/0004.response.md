Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, a list of `k` distinct integers in strictly increasing order between 1 and 100 inclusive, and `b`, a list of `q` integers between 1 and 100 inclusive. If the conditions for `a` and `b` are met, the function returns a list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in `a`, maintaining a list of `k` distinct integers in strictly increasing order between 0 and 99 inclusive. Otherwise, it returns the list `b` containing `q` integers between 1 and 100 inclusive.**
