The given code attempts to subtract 1 from a list `a`. However, in Python, you cannot directly subtract an integer from a list using the `-` operator. This operation would result in a TypeError. Assuming the intention was to subtract 1 from each element in the list `a`, the corrected operation would involve a list comprehension or a loop.

Given the initial state and the intended operation, the correct interpretation should be subtracting 1 from each element in list `a`.

Let's assume the operation is corrected to:
```python
return [element - 1 for element in a]
```

Now, let's calculate the output state:

If `a` is a list of `k` distinct integers in strictly increasing order, each between 1 and 100 inclusive, subtracting 1 from each element will result in a new list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in `a`. The new list will still contain `k` distinct integers in strictly increasing order, but each will be between 0 and 99 inclusive.

Output State: **The program returns a list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`, resulting in a list of `k` distinct integers in strictly increasing order, each between 0 and 99 inclusive.**
