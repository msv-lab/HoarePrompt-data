### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Path Calculation**:
   - For Bodya and Sasha, the program calculates the path they can take by following the permutation `p` starting from their respective positions `P_B` and `P_S`.
   - It uses a visited list `vis` to detect cycles in the permutation, ensuring it doesn't revisit positions unnecessarily.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - For each path, the program calculates the potential scores for Bodya and Sasha up to `k` moves.
   - It considers all possible positions up to `k` moves and calculates the score for each possible sequence of moves.
   - The program uses a greedy approach to maximize the score by choosing the best possible move at each step.

4. **Result Determination**:
   - After calculating the maximum possible scores for both players, the program compares them.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, or "Draw" if their scores are equal.

### Verification:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, such as cycles in the permutation and the large value of `k` (up to \(10^9\)) by only considering the first `k` moves.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly solves the problem as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
