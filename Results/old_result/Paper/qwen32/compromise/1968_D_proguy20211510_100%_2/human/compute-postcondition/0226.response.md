In the given task, the `while` loop is `while True:`, which means it is an infinite loop and will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of. Therefore, no modifications to the program state are necessary to ensure that the next iteration of the loop can proceed. The loop will continue as long as the program does not encounter a `break` statement or similar mechanism to exit the loop.

Given that the loop is `while True:`, we can simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is the index that caused the loop to terminate; `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `pathb` is a list that now includes the elements from `a` visited before a cycle was detected; `paths` is a list containing the element `a[ps - 1]`; `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is set to 1; `preb` is the sum of `pathb` elements up to the point where the loop terminates; `pres` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `paths` (which remains 0); `i` is the number of completed iterations of the loop, which is the minimum of `len(paths)` and `k` (which remains 0); `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` in the range of the loop; `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[j] * (k - j)` for `j` in the range of the loop (which remains unchanged); `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `ress`; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; and if `vis[ps - 1]` is equal to 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
