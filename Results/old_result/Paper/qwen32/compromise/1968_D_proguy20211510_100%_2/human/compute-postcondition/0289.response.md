Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives four integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, and two lists `p` and `a` of length `n`. The function returns a result for each test case based on the provided values, where `n` is the number of elements in the lists, `k` is another positive integer, `P_B` and `P_S` are positions, and `p` and `a` are lists of integers.**
