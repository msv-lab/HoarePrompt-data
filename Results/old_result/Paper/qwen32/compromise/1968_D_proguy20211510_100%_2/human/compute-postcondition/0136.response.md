Given the `while True` loop, the loop will continue to execute indefinitely unless there is a `break` statement inside the loop body that is triggered by certain conditions. Since the loop body is omitted, we assume that there are no conditions within the loop that would cause it to break. Therefore, the loop will always execute one more time.

Since the loop is `while True`, no specific variables need to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute one more time. The state can be repeated as is.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the value causing the cycle detection, `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` before the cycle was detected, `paths` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` including the newly appended value `a[ps - 1]`, `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `preb` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(pathb))` elements of `pathb`, `pres` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(paths))` elements of `paths`, and `i` is `min(k, len(paths))`. Additionally, `resb` is the greater of the two values `resb` and `ress`. If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, the loop is broken out of.**
