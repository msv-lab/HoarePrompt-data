To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop behavior:

The loop continues to execute as long as `vis[pb - 1]` is not equal to 1. When `vis[pb - 1]` becomes 1, it means we've encountered a cycle, and the loop terminates. During each iteration:
- The current value of `a[pb - 1]` is appended to `pathb`.
- `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`.
- `vis[pb - 1]` is set to 1 (though in your description, it seems this is only mentioned in the context of the termination condition).

Given the provided output states for the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue appending values to `pathb` and updating `pb` until `pb` points to an index that has already been visited (`vis[pb - 1]` equals 1).

Let's denote the final state when the loop terminates:
- `pb` will be the value that causes the loop to terminate, i.e., `vis[pb - 1]` is 1.
- `pathb` will contain the sequence of values from `a` corresponding to the path taken until the cycle is detected.
- `vis` will have 1s at the indices corresponding to the visited nodes in the path.

Since the loop terminates when a cycle is detected, the final state of `pathb` will be the sequence of values from `a` corresponding to the path taken until the cycle is detected.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the value causing the loop to terminate (i.e., `vis[pb - 1]` is 1), `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` corresponding to the path taken until the cycle is detected, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except the indices corresponding to the visited nodes in `pathb` which are 1.**

In simpler terms, the loop will keep appending elements from `a` to `pathb` by following the indices in `p` until it hits a node it has already visited, at which point it stops. The `vis` list will reflect which nodes have been visited by marking them with 1.
