Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the index that caused the loop to terminate, `ps` is the index that caused the loop to terminate, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list that now includes the elements from `a` visited before a cycle was detected, `paths` is a list containing all the elements from `a` visited before the cycle was detected and must have at least one element, `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is set to 1, `preb` is the sum of the first `min(len(pathb), k)` elements of `pathb`, `pres` is `paths[i]`, `i` is the minimum of `len(pathb)` and `k` plus 1, provided `i` is less than `len(paths)`, `resb` is the maximum of `preb + pathb[j] * (k - j)` for `j` from 0 to `i - 1`, `ress` is `max(ress, curr)`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `curr` is `paths[i] * (k - i)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language Description: The values of the variables remain unchanged, except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
