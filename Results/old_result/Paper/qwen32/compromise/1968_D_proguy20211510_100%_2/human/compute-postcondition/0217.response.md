To determine the final state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop continues appending elements from the list `a` to `pathb` and updating `pb` using the list `p` until a cycle is detected (i.e., `vis[pb - 1]` becomes 1).

Given the initial state and the description of the loop, the final state will be achieved when `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, indicating that we've encountered a previously visited index, thus breaking the loop.

Here's the final state of the variables after the loop has terminated:

- `t`, `n`, `k`, `ps`, `a`, `paths`, `vis`, `preb`, `pres`, `i`, `resb`, `ress`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial state except for the following:
- `pathb` will contain the sequence of elements from `a` that were visited before a cycle was detected.
- `pb` will be the index that caused the loop to terminate because `vis[pb - 1]` was already 1.
- `vis[pb - 1]` will still be 1, indicating that this index was the start of the cycle.
- `preb` will be the sum of the elements in `pathb` at the point where the loop terminates.
- `resb` will be the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` in the range of the loop.
- `ress` and `resb` will be recalculated based on the sums and values in `paths` and `pathb`, respectively, but since `paths` remains empty, `ress` will not change from its initial state.

Here's the final output state in the required format:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is the index that caused the loop to terminate; `ps` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `pathb` is a list that now includes the elements from `a` visited before a cycle was detected; `paths` is an empty list; `vis` is a list of integers with `vis[pb - 1]` set to 1; `preb` is the sum of `pathb` elements up to the point where the loop terminates; `pres` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `paths` (which remains 0); `i` is the number of completed iterations of the loop, which is the minimum of `len(paths)` and `k` (which remains 0); `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` in the range of the loop; `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[j] * (k - j)` for `j` in the range of the loop (which remains unchanged); `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `ress`; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
