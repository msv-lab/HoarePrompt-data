Given that the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will continue to execute indefinitely unless there is a `break` statement inside the loop body that is not provided in this snippet. Therefore, we need to ensure that the state at the end of the previous iteration allows the loop to proceed without any conditions that would cause it to terminate prematurely.

In this case, since there are no conditions in the `while True` loop, the state at the end of the previous iteration can be repeated as it is because the loop will continue to execute regardless of the current state.

Thus, the state does not need any modification.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`; `ps` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `pathb` is a list that now includes `a[pb - 1]`; `paths` is an empty list; `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[pb - 1]` which is 1; `preb` is the sum of `pathb` elements up to the point where the loop terminates; `pres` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `paths`; `i` is the number of completed iterations of the loop, which is the minimum of `len(paths)` and `k`; `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` in the range of the loop; `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[j] * (k - j)` for `j` in the range of the loop; `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `ress`; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
