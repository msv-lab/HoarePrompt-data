The given code snippet reads four space-separated values from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. These values are read as strings, so the variables `n` and `k` will be strings representing integers, and `pb` and `ps` will also be strings.

Here is the updated state of the variables after the execution of the code snippet:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is a string representing an integer, `k` is a string representing an integer, `pb` is a string, `ps` is a string, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` corresponding to the path taken until the cycle is detected, `paths` is a list containing all the elements from `a` corresponding to the path taken until the cycle is detected, `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except for the indices corresponding to the path taken until the cycle is detected, which are set to 1, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `preb` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(pathb))` elements of `pathb`, `pres` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(paths))` elements of `paths`, and `i` is `min(k, len(paths))`. Additionally, `resb` is the greater of the two values `resb` and `ress`. If `ress` was greater than `resb`, `resb` is updated to the value of `ress`.**

In simpler terms, `n` and `k` are now strings representing integers, and `pb` and `ps` are strings. All other variables retain their previous values and states.
