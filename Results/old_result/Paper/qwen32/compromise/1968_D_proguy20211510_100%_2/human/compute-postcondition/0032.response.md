The code snippet `ps = p[ps - 1]` updates the value of `ps` to the value at the index `ps - 1` in the list `p`. Given the initial state, `ps` is an integer, and `p` is a list of integers. The value of `ps` is updated based on the value of `p[ps - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the value causing the loop to terminate (i.e., `vis[pb - 1]` is 1), `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` corresponding to the path taken until the cycle is detected, `paths` is a list containing the single element `a[ps - 1]`, `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1.**
