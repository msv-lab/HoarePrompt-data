Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0.**

Explanation: The variable `vis` is created and initialized as a list with `n` elements, all set to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`) remain unchanged.
