The code snippet provided is:
```python
curr = pres + paths[i] * (k - i)
```

This line calculates a new value for `curr` based on the current values of `pres`, `paths[i]`, `k`, and `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the value causing the cycle detection, `ps` is the value causing the cycle detection, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` before the cycle was detected, `paths` is a list containing at least one element from `a`, `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` in the range of the loop, `ress` is the maximum value between its previous value and `curr`, `preb` is the sum of `pathb` elements up to the point where the loop terminates, `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `curr` is updated to be the sum of `pres` and the product of `paths[i]` and `(k - i)`. All other variables retain their previous values.
