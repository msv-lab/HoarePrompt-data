The `break` statement in the provided code snippet will terminate the loop it is inside, but it will not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the variables will retain their values as they were before the `break` statement was executed.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the value causing the cycle detection, `ps` is the value causing the cycle detection, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` before the cycle was detected, `paths` is a list containing at least one element from `a`, `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` in the range of the loop, `ress` is the maximum value between its previous value and `curr`, `preb` is the sum of `pathb` elements up to the point where the loop terminates, `pres` is the previous value of `pres` plus `paths[i]`, `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
