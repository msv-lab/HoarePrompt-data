Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the value causing the cycle detection, `ps` is the value causing the cycle detection, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` before the cycle was detected, `paths` is a list containing at least one element from `a`, `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` in the range of the loop, `ress` is the maximum value between its previous value and `curr`, `preb` is the sum of `pathb` elements up to the point where the loop terminates, `pres` is the previous value of `pres` plus `paths[i]`, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`.**

In natural language: The value of `ress` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the value of `curr`. All other variables retain their previous values.
