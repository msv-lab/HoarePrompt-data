The code `vis[pb - 1] = 1` modifies the list `vis` by setting the element at index `pb - 1` to 1. Given that `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0, this means that the element at the position `pb - 1` will now be 1, while all other elements in `vis` remain 0.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except `vis[pb - 1]` which is 1.**
