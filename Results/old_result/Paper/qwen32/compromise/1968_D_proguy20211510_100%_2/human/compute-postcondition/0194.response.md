The code snippet provided reads four space-separated values from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. These variables were previously defined with specific conditions and values, but the code snippet changes their values based on the input.

Here's the updated state of the variables after the code execution:

- `n` is now the first value read from the input.
- `k` is now the second value read from the input.
- `pb` is now the third value read from the input.
- `ps` is now the fourth value read from the input.

The other variables (`t`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `preb`, `pres`, `i`, `resb`, `ress`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first value read from the input; `k` is the second value read from the input; `pb` is the third value read from the input; `ps` is the fourth value read from the input; `p` and `a` are lists of integers obtained from the input; `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` before the cycle was detected; `paths` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` including the newly appended value `a[ps - 1]` up to the value causing the cycle detection; `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1; `preb` is the sum of `pathb` elements up to the point where the loop terminates; `pres` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `paths`; `i` is the number of completed iterations of the loop, which is the minimum of `len(paths)` and `k`; `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` in the range of the loop; `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[j] * (k - j)` for `j` in the range of the loop; and `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `ress`.**
