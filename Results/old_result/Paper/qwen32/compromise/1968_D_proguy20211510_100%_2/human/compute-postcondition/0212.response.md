In this case, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely until a `break` statement is encountered. Since there is no condition in the loop head to evaluate, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. We simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is `p[pb - 1]` (updated); `ps` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `pathb` is a list that now includes `a[pb - 1]` twice; `paths` is an empty list; `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[pb - 1]` which is 1; `preb` is the sum of `pathb` elements up to the point where the loop terminates; `pres` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `paths`; `i` is the number of completed iterations of the loop, which is the minimum of `len(paths)` and `k`; `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` in the range of the loop; `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[j] * (k - j)` for `j` in the range of the loop; `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `ress`; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
