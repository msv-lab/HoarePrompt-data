Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the index that caused the loop to terminate, `ps` is the index that caused the loop to terminate, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list that contains at least one element from `a`, `paths` is a list containing all the elements from `a` visited before the cycle was detected, `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is set to 1, `preb` is `preb + pathb[i]`, `pres` is 0, `i` is 2, `resb` is the maximum of its previous value and `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `ress` is 0, `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: After executing the `break` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged except that we exit the most internal loop or if statement. The variable `curr` is set to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, and `resb` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `curr`. All other variables retain their initial values.
