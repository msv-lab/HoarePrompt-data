You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    elif n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(n)
    elif k - 1 < n - k + 1:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(n - k + 1, 1)
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the input and prints "YES" followed by additional information if `n` is greater than or equal to `k` and certain conditions are met; otherwise, it prints "NO". Specifically, if `n` is equal to `k`, it prints "YES", "1", and `n`. If `n` is greater than `k` and `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, it prints "YES", "2", and the values `n - k + 1` and `1`. In all other cases, it prints "NO".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all possible cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not ensure that Alice buys exactly k jewels by setting up at most 60 stalls with appropriate prices. The current logic is too simplistic and fails to cover many scenarios.

Let's analyze the provided program and find a counterexample:

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Case 1**: `if n < k: print('NO')`
   - This is correct. If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels she wants to buy, it's impossible.

2. **Case 2**: `elif n == k: print('YES'); print(1); print(n)`
   - This is also correct. If Alice has exactly the same number of coins as the number of jewels, she can buy all jewels from one stall priced at `n` coins.

3. **Case 3**: `elif k - 1 < n - k + 1: print('YES'); print(2); print(n - k + 1, 1)`
   - This logic is incorrect. It assumes that only two stalls are needed and sets prices in a way that may not ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 5`, the program would print `YES`, `2`, `6 1`, but Alice would buy 1 jewel at the first stall (since `10 // 6 = 1`), and then 4 jewels at the second stall (since `4 // 1 = 4`), totaling 5 jewels. However, the logic does not generalize well and fails for other cases.

4. **Default Case**: `else: print('NO')`
   - This is incorrect for many cases where it should be possible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
10 5
```
The program would output:
```
YES
2
6 1
```
As explained above, Alice would buy 1 jewel at the first stall and 4 jewels at the second stall, totaling 5 jewels, which is correct in this specific case but the logic is not robust for all cases.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, Bob should set up stalls in a way that ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One strategy is to use binary search to determine the optimal prices for the stalls. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that Alice buys greedily and set up stalls with decreasing prices such that the sum of the number of jewels bought equals `k`.

For example, for `n = 10` and `k = 5`, a correct output could be:
```
YES
5
2 2 2 2 2
```
Here, Alice buys 1 jewel from each of the 5 stalls, totaling 5 jewels.

Given the complexity and the need to handle large numbers, a more generalized and correct approach is necessary. The provided program does not handle all cases correctly, hence the correctness is **False**.
