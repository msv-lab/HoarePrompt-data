The given Python code snippet contains only a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides several conditions and variable definitions, but none of these affect the output of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state defines `t` as an integer between 1 and 1000.
2. It also defines `n` and `k` as positive integers where `1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}`, `n >= k`, `n != k`, and `k - 1 < n - k + 1`.
3. However, these conditions and definitions do not influence the `print` statement, which is a simple output of the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
