Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `k` are the two positive integers read from the input, where 1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}. If `n` is less than `k`, no changes are made. If `n` is equal to `k`, no changes are made. If `n` is greater than `k`, the relationship between `k - 1` and `n - k + 1` is determined: either `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1` or `k - 1` is not less than `n - k + 1`.**
