To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head:

```python
while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means that for the loop to execute, the variable `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than the length of the `permutation` list.

### Analysis of the Given State:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n`.
- `idx` is 0.
- `idx_v` is 1.
- `curr_v` is `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k) + 1`.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2.
- `i` is 2.

### Key Variables:
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i`: This variable is compared against the length of the `permutation` list (`len(permutation)`).
- `len(permutation)`: Since `permutation` is a list of length `n`, `len(permutation)` is `n`.

### Condition for Loop Execution:
For the loop to execute, the condition `multiples_of_k_plus_i < n` must be true.

### Current Value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i`:
- The current value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2.

### Adjustment Requirement:
Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2, the condition `2 < n` must hold true for the loop to execute. Given that `n` is an integer and `2 <= k <= n`, the smallest possible value for `n` is 2. However, since `k` is even and `2 <= k <= n`, the smallest possible value for `n` that satisfies all conditions is 4 (when `k = 2`).

Therefore, as long as `n` is at least 3 (since `2 < 3`), the loop can execute.

### Conclusion:
No adjustment is needed for `multiples_of_k_plus_i` since it is already 2. The only requirement is that `n` must be at least 3 to satisfy the condition `multiples_of_k_plus_i < n`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values 1, 2, ..., `floor(n/k)` at positions 0, `k`, `2k`, ..., `(floor(n/k) - 1) * k`, `floor(n/k) + 1` at position 1, `floor(n/k) + 2` at position `k + 1`, ..., `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k)` at position `(floor((n-1)/k) - 1) * k + 1`, and 0 elsewhere; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k) + 1`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2; `i` is 2; `n` must be at least 3**
