To determine the final state of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `permutation` list and the variables involved. The loop continues until `multiples_of_k_plus_i` reaches or exceeds the length of the `permutation` list, which is `n`.

From the given outputs after the first three iterations, we can observe the pattern:

- After the first iteration, `permutation[1]` is set to `floor(n/k) + 1`.
- After the second iteration, `permutation[k + 1]` is set to `floor(n/k) + 2`.
- After the third iteration, `permutation[2k + 1]` is set to `floor(n/k) + 3`.

This pattern suggests that on the `m`-th iteration, `permutation[(m-1)k + 1]` is set to `floor(n/k) + m`. The loop will continue until `(m-1)k + 1` is no longer less than `n`.

The loop stops when `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is no longer less than `n`. Therefore, the last valid index updated in the `permutation` list is `(floor((n-1)/k))k + 1`.

Let's denote `floor(n/k)` as `q`. The loop will run until `multiples_of_k_plus_i` becomes `qk + 1`, which is the first index that is not less than `n` (since `qk` is the last multiple of `k` less than `n`).

Thus, the final state of the loop is:
- `permutation[i]` for `i` in `{1, k+1, 2k+1, ..., (q-1)k+1}` will be set to `{floor(n/k) + 1, floor(n/k) + 2, ..., q}`.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be `qk + 1`.
- `curr_v` will be `q + 1`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values 1, 2, ..., `floor(n/k)` at positions 0, `k`, `2k`, ..., `(floor(n/k) - 1) * k`, `floor(n/k) + 1` at position 1, `floor(n/k) + 2` at position `k + 1`, ..., `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k)` at position `(floor((n-1)/k) - 1) * k + 1`, and 0 elsewhere; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k) + 1`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `floor((n-1)/k) * k + 1`; `i` is 1.** 

In simpler terms, the `permutation` list will have values from `floor(n/k) + 1` to `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k)` placed at specific positions, and the rest of the elements will remain as initially defined. The loop terminates when it tries to update an index that is out of bounds.
