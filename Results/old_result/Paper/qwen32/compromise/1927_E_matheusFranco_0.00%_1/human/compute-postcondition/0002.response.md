To determine the output state, we need to know what `func_1()` does. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine the exact changes to the variables or any return values. However, based on the given initial state and the call to `func_1()`, we can infer that the only known condition is that `t` must be greater than 0.

Since there is no additional information about `func_1()`, we can only assume that `t` remains unchanged unless `func_1()` explicitly modifies it. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `t` is still greater than 0, and there are no other changes to the state unless specified by `func_1()`.

Given the lack of details about `func_1()`, the most accurate output state we can provide is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.
