The code snippet assigns the value of `curr_v` to the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` in the `permutation` list. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even.
- `n` must be greater than `2k + 1`.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n` with specific values at certain positions.
- `idx` is 0.
- `idx_v` is 1.
- `curr_v` is `floor(n/k) + 3`.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2k + 1`.
- `i` is 1.

The value at index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` (which is `2k + 1`) in the `permutation` list is updated to `curr_v` (`floor(n/k) + 3`).

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `n` must be greater than `2k + 1`; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values 1, 2, ..., `floor(n/k)` at positions 0, `k`, `2k`, ..., `(floor(n/k) - 1) * k`, `floor(n/k) + 1` at position 1, `floor(n/k) + 2` at position `k + 1`, `floor(n/k) + 3` at position `2k + 1`, and 0 elsewhere; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor(n/k) + 3`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2k + 1`; `i` is 1.**
