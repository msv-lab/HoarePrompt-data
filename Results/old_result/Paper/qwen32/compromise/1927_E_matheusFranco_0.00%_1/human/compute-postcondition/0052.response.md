To determine the output of the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and Initial Values:**
   - `n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even.
   - `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values from 1 to `n` distributed according to a specific pattern.
   - `idx` is initialized to 0.
   - `idx_v` is initialized to 1.
   - `curr_v` is initialized to `n + 1`.
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is the last position updated in the final iteration.
   - `i` is initialized to `k-1`.
   - `result` is a space-separated string of the elements in `permutation`.

2. **Pattern of `permutation`:**
   - The pattern is not explicitly described in the initial state, but we know it contains values from 1 to `n` in some order.
   - Given the context, we can infer that `permutation` is likely a rearrangement of numbers from 1 to `n` following a specific rule involving `k`.

3. **Result Construction:**
   - `result` is constructed as a space-separated string of the elements in `permutation`.

Given these points, we cannot determine the exact numerical values in `permutation` without more specific details about the pattern. However, we know that `result` will be a string representation of the `permutation` list with elements separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be a space-separated string of numbers from 1 to `n` arranged according to the described pattern.

Output: **result (where result is a space-separated string of the elements in the permutation list)**
