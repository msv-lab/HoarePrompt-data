Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values 1, 2, ..., `floor(n/k)` at positions 0, `k`, `2k`, ..., `(floor(n/k) - 1) * k`, `floor(n/k) + 1` at position 1, and 0 elsewhere; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor(n/k) + 2`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `k + 1`; `i` is 1.** 

In natural language: The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is updated to `k + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
