Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

We need to generate a k-level permutation of length `n` where `k` is even. A k-level permutation is defined such that among all sums of continuous segments of length `k`, the difference between the maximum and minimum sums is at most 1.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution consists of two functions:

1. **func_1()**: This function reads a pair of integers `n` and `k`, constructs a permutation of length `n`, and prints it.
2. **func_2()**: This function handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1()` until all test cases have been processed.

#### Function `func_1()` Breakdown

1. **Initialization**:
   - `(n, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))`: Reads the values of `n` and `k`.
   - `permutation = [0] * n`: Initializes a list of length `n` with zeros.
   - `idx = 0` and `idx_v = 1`: These variables seem to be intended for indexing, but they are not used in the loop.
   - `curr_v = 1`: This variable keeps track of the current value to be placed in the permutation.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The outer loop runs `k` times.
   - For each iteration `i` of the outer loop:
     - `multiples_of_k_plus_i = i`: Initializes a variable to keep track of the current index in the permutation.
     - The inner while loop runs until `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of the permutation.
       - `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v`: Assigns the current value `curr_v` to the position `multiples_of_k_plus_i` in the permutation.
       - `curr_v += 1`: Increments the current value.
       - `multiples_of_k_plus_i += k`: Moves to the next position that is `k` steps ahead.

3. **Output**:
   - The constructed permutation is converted to a string and printed.

### Correctness Evaluation

Let's evaluate whether this approach generates a k-level permutation:

- **Pattern of Assignment**: The code assigns values to the permutation in a pattern where every `k`-th position starting from `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `k-1`) gets the next available value. This means that the first `k` positions will have the smallest `k` values, the next `k` positions will have the next `k` values, and so on.
  
- **Sum of Segments**: Consider the sums of segments of length `k`. Since the values are assigned in blocks of `k`, the sums of these segments will be very close to each other. Specifically, the sums of the first `k` elements, the next `k` elements, and so on, will differ by at most the difference between the largest and smallest values in those segments, which is minimized due to the way values are assigned.

- **Even `k` Constraint**: The problem specifies that `k` is even. The solution does not explicitly use this fact, but the pattern of assignment ensures that the sums of segments of length `k` will be balanced due to the alternating nature of the assignments.

### Conclusion

The provided solution correctly constructs a k-level permutation for each test case. It ensures that the sums of segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1, satisfying the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
