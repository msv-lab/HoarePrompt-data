### Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to verify whether the generated permutation meets the criteria of being a k-level permutation. Specifically, for a permutation to be k-level, the sums of all continuous segments of length k must differ by no more than 1.

Let's re-examine the function `func_1()` to understand how it constructs the permutation:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - A list `permutation` of length `n` is initialized with zeros.
   - Variables `idx`, `idx_v`, and `curr_v` are initialized to 1.

2. **Filling the Permutation**:
   - The outer loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = k-1`.
   - For each `i`, the inner loop places values starting from `curr_v` into positions that are multiples of `k` plus `i`.
   - The variable `curr_v` increments after placing each value.

Let's analyze the pattern of filling the permutation list with an example:

#### Example Walkthrough:
Consider `n = 10` and `k = 4`.

- **Step-by-step filling**:
  - For `i = 0`, place values at positions `0, 4, 8`:
    - `permutation[0] = 1`
    - `permutation[4] = 2`
    - `permutation[8] = 3`
  - For `i = 1`, place values at positions `1, 5, 9`:
    - `permutation[1] = 4`
    - `permutation[5] = 5`
    - `permutation[9] = 6`
  - For `i = 2`, place values at positions `2, 6`:
    - `permutation[2] = 7`
    - `permutation[6] = 8`
  - For `i = 3`, place values at positions `3, 7`:
    - `permutation[3] = 9`
    - `permutation[7] = 10`

The resulting permutation is `[1, 4, 7, 9, 2, 5, 8, 10, 3, 6]`.

- **Calculating segment sums**:
  - Segment `[1, 4, 7, 9]` has a sum of 21.
  - Segment `[4, 7, 9, 2]` has a sum of 22.
  - Segment `[7, 9, 2, 5]` has a sum of 23.
  - Segment `[9, 2, 5, 8]` has a sum of 24.
  - Segment `[2, 5, 8, 10]` has a sum of 25.
  - Segment `[5, 8, 10, 3]` has a sum of 26.
  - Segment `[8, 10, 3, 6]` has a sum of 27.

The sums of these segments vary from 21 to 27, which clearly violates the condition that any two sums should differ by no more than 1.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly generate a k-level permutation for the given examples and constraints. The sums of the segments of length `k` do not meet the required condition, indicating that the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
