To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic that determines the outcome of the game based on the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Consideration**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns moving their chips.
   - Alice moves down, down-right, or down-left.
   - Bob moves up, up-right, or up-left.
   - The game ends if one player's chip lands on the other's chip.
   - The game is a draw if a player cannot make a move.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If Alice's chip is initially in a row higher than Bob's chip (xa > xb), then Alice cannot win because she cannot move upwards, and Bob can always move upwards to avoid Alice. Thus, the game will end in a draw.
   - If Alice's chip is initially in a row lower than or equal to Bob's chip (xa <= xb), the game's outcome depends on the relative positions of their chips and the board's dimensions.

3. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - If `xa > xb`, the game is a draw because Alice cannot move upwards.
   - If `xa <= xb`, we need to determine if Alice can force a win. The key here is to determine if Alice can move her chip to a position where Bob's chip is either directly below or diagonally below her chip in a way that Bob cannot avoid a collision.
   - The logic in the code calculates the maximum distance `x` Alice can move vertically towards Bob (`x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`). If the distance is odd, Alice can potentially reach a position where she can force a win if Bob's chip is within a certain horizontal range. If the distance is even, Bob can potentially avoid Alice by moving to a position where Alice cannot reach him.

4. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly handles the case where `xa > xb` by printing "Draw".
   - For `xa <= xb`, the code calculates the vertical distance `x` Alice can move and then checks if Bob's chip is within a certain horizontal range (`l` to `r`) that Alice can reach. The logic for determining the horizontal range and checking if Alice can force a win seems correct based on the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic to determine the outcome of the game based on the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. The code handles all edge cases and correctly prints the result for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
