To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic step by step:

1. **Game Mechanics and Initial Observations**:
   - Alice starts and can move down, down-left, or down-right.
   - Bob moves up, up-left, or up-right.
   - The game ends in a win if a player lands on the other player's chip.
   - The game ends in a draw if a player cannot make a move.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If `xa > xb`, Alice is already below Bob. Since Alice can only move down and Bob can only move up, Alice cannot reach Bob's position, and Bob cannot reach Alice's position. Hence, the game ends in a draw.
   - If `xa <= xb`, Alice needs to move towards Bob, and Bob needs to move away or towards Alice.

3. **Strategy Analysis**:
   - The distance between Alice and Bob in the x-direction is `abs(xa - xb)`.
   - Alice's optimal strategy is to move diagonally towards Bob, and Bob's optimal strategy is to move diagonally away from Alice.
   - The variable `x` in the code is half of the distance between Alice and Bob in the x-direction (`abs(xa - xb) // 2`).

4. **Conditions for Winning**:
   - If the distance in the x-direction is odd (`abs(xa - xb) % 2`), Alice can potentially catch up with Bob.
     - `l` and `r` are the bounds within which Alice can move horizontally to reach Bob's column within `x + 1` moves.
     - If Alice can reach Bob's column within these bounds, Alice wins.
   - If the distance in the x-direction is even, Bob can potentially avoid Alice.
     - `l` and `r` are the bounds within which Bob can move horizontally to avoid Alice's column within `x` moves.
     - If Bob can avoid Alice's column within these bounds, Bob wins.

5. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly implements the logic described above.
   - It correctly calculates the bounds (`l` and `r`) based on the distance in the x-direction.
   - It correctly checks if Alice can win when the distance is odd and if Bob can avoid Alice when the distance is even.
   - The use of tuple indexing in the print statement (`print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[condition])`) is a concise way to select the output based on the condition.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the game logic and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
