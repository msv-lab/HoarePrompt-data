Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` must be greater than `t + 1`, `m` is the second integer read from the new input, `a` is a list containing three input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the last character of the last string in `a`, `i` is `t + 1`**

In natural language: The list `a` now contains three input strings instead of two. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `first_row`, `last_row`, and `i` remain unchanged.
