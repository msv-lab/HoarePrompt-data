The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `t`, `n` is greater than `t`. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `t + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `t + 1`.

State: **`t` is `t`, `n` must be greater than `t + 1`, `m` is the second integer read from the new input, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the last character of the last string in `a`, `i` is `t + 1`**
