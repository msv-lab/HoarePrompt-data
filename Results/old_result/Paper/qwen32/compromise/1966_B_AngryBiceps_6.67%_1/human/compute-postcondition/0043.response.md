The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last element in the list `a` to `last_row`. Given that `a` is a list containing the first input string and two newly appended strings, `a[-1]` refers to the last newly appended string. Therefore, `a[-1][-1]` is the last character of the last newly appended string. Since `last_row` is initially the last character of the newly appended string concatenated with itself, after executing the code, `last_row` will have the last character of the last newly appended string appended to it again.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list containing the first input string and two newly appended strings, `first_row` is the concatenation of its original value and the first characters of both newly appended strings, `last_row` is the last character of the newly appended string concatenated with itself twice, `i` is 2**.
