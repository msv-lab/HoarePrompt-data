The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last string in the list `a` to `last_row`. Therefore, the value of `last_row` changes.

Initial State: `t` is `t`, `n` must be greater than `t + 1`, `m` is the second integer read from the new input, `a` is a list containing three input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a` and then the first character of the last string in `a` again, `last_row` is the last character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the last character of the last string in `a`, `i` is `t + 1`

After executing the code, `last_row` will be its previous value concatenated with the last character of the last string in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` must be greater than `t + 1`, `m` is the second integer read from the new input, `a` is a list containing three input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a` and then the first character of the last string in `a` again, `last_row` is the last character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the last character of the last string in `a` concatenated with the last character of the last string in `a` again, `i` is `t + 1`**.
