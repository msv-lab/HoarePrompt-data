Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^3.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    print('1 1')
    print('1 2')
    if n == 3:
        print('2 3')
    else:
        print('2 4')
        for j in range(4, n + 1):
            print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50; `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 3, then the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `n` is greater than 3 and `j` is set to `n` + 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50; `n` is the new input integer; `i` is incremented by 1. If `n` is 3, `j` remains unchanged. If `n` is greater than 3, `j` is set to `n` + 1. If `n` is less than 3, `j` is set to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50; `n` is an input integer; `i` is 3. If `n` is equal to 3, the program does not perform any additional actions. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, the program prints each integer from 4 to `n`, with each integer printed twice on its respective line.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
