The code snippet `n = int(input())` reassigns the value of `n` based on the new input. The other variables (`t`, `j`, and `i`) remain unchanged unless `n` takes on a specific value of 3, in which case no further changes occur to `j`.

Here's the output state:

- `t` remains an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50.
- `n` is now the new input integer.
- If the new `n` is 3, then `j` remains unchanged (or is not set if it was not previously set).
- If the new `n` is greater than 3, then `j` is set to `n` + 1.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50; `n` is the new input integer; if the new `n` is 3, `j` remains unchanged; if the new `n` is greater than 3, `j` is `n` + 1; `i` is incremented by 1.**
