To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the loop's behavior:

The loop iterates over `j` starting from 4 up to `n` (inclusive). For each iteration, it prints `str(j) + ' ' + str(j)`. 

Given that the loop executes all the iterations, `j` will take on every integer value from 4 to `n`.

The output state after all iterations will be characterized by the fact that `j` will have finished its iteration range, meaning `j` will be `n + 1` at the end of the loop, as the loop terminates when `j` reaches `n + 1`.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50; `n` is an input integer such that `n` > 3; `j` is `n` + 1**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, `j` will be one more than `n`, and the values of `t` and `n` will remain as they were initially.
