To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50.
- `n` is at least 4.
- `j` can be any integer.

The loop is defined as:
```
for j in range(4, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will iterate over the range from 4 to `n` inclusive.
- At the end of each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.
- For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n + 1`.

### Current State:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` has some integer value.
- `n` is at least 4 and remains unchanged.
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

### State Adjustment:
- To start the next iteration, `j` must be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

### Conclusion:
- If `j` was 4 at the end of the previous iteration, it should be 5 at the start of the next iteration.
- If `j` was 5 at the end of the previous iteration, it should be 6 at the start of the next iteration.
- This pattern continues until `j` reaches `n`.

Given that `j` can be any integer at the end of the previous iteration, we assume it has just completed an iteration where it was some value `k` (where 4 <= `k` < `n`). Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `k + 1`.

Since we do not have the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize that `j` should be incremented by 1.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, `n` is at least 4, `j` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

To be more specific, if `j` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, `n` is at least 4, `j` is `x + 1`**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `x`, we can write:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, `n` is at least 4, `j` is incremented by 1**.
