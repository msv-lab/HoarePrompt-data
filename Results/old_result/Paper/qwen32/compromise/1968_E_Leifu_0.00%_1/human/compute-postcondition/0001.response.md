In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the variable `t`. The state before the loop starts includes the variable `t`, which is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` represents the number of test cases.

To ensure that the loop executes, the variable `t` must be at least 1. Given the constraints, `t` is already guaranteed to be at least 1 and at most 50. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

The variable `i` in the loop head is the loop variable that will take on the values from 0 to `t-1`. Before the loop starts, `i` does not need to be initialized since it is set by the `range` function in the loop head.

The variable `n` is mentioned in the problem description but is not part of the loop head. It is used within each test case but does not affect whether the loop itself executes. Therefore, `n` does not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50**
