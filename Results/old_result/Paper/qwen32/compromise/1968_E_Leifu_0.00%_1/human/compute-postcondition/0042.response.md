Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet:

Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.
- `j` is 6.

Code Snippet:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Explanation:
- The variable `j` is explicitly defined as 6.
- The `print` statement concatenates the string representation of `j` with a space character and the string representation of `j` again.
- This results in the string "6 6" being printed.

Output: **6 6**
