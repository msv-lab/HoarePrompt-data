To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to analyze the loop and how it behaves given the input conditions.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(4, n + 1):
    print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

This loop will iterate from `j = 4` to `j = n` (inclusive). The number of iterations is `n - 3` because the range starts at 4 and goes up to `n`.

Given the output states after the first three iterations:
- After the first iteration, `n` must be at least 4.
- After the second iteration, `n` must be at least 5 (since the loop iterates from 4 to 5).
- After the third iteration, `n` must be at least 6 (since the loop iterates from 4 to 6).

Therefore, after all iterations, the loop will have executed `n - 3` times, and `j` will take on values from 4 to `n`.

The final state of the loop variable `j` after all iterations will be `n` because the loop iterates from 4 to `n`.

The variable `i` is incremented by 1 outside the loop, but since the loop's iterations do not affect `i` directly, `i` will simply be its initial value plus 1.

The variable `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop, as it is not affected by the loop's iterations.

Thus, the final output state is:
- `t` remains the same as the initial input.
- `n` remains the same as the initial input.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `j` will be `n` after the loop completes.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, `n` is the input integer, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is `n`.**

In natural language:
The final output state is that `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains the same as the input, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is equal to `n` after the loop has completed all its iterations.
