Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
2. `n` is at least 4.
3. `j` is incremented by 1.

The key point here is that `j` is incremented by 1. However, we do not have an initial value for `j` provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can assume that `j` starts at some value, and after being incremented by 1, it will have a new value.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet converts the value of `j` to a string twice and concatenates these string representations with a space in between.
- Since `j` is incremented by 1 before this print statement, the value of `j` will be whatever its initial value was plus 1.

### Output:
Since we don't have the initial value of `j`, we can denote the initial value of `j` as `j_initial`. After incrementing `j` by 1, the value of `j` becomes `j_initial + 1`. Therefore, the print statement will output the value `j_initial + 1` twice, separated by a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **[j_initial + 1] [j_initial + 1] (where j_initial + 1 is the value of j after being incremented by 1)**

However, since we do not have the specific initial value of `j`, we can only express the output in terms of `j_initial + 1`.

Output: **[j + 1] [j + 1] (where j + 1 is the value of j after being incremented by 1)**
