The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'1 1'`. This string is hardcoded and does not depend on the values of the variables `t` and `n` mentioned in the initial state.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state provides information about the variables `t` and `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'1 1'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the string `'1 1'`.

Output: **1 1**
