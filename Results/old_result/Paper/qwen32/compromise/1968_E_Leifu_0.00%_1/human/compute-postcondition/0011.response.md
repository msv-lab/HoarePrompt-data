The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is some value, and `n` is greater than 3. At the start of the next iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.

Given the loop starts with `j` initialized to 4, and `n` is greater than 3, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have been some value, say `k`, where `4 <= k <= n`. For the next iteration, `j` should be `k + 1`.

Since we do not know the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize that `j` should be incremented by 1 for the next iteration to continue. Therefore, if `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `k + 1`.

Since we are not given the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, we can assume `j` was the last value it took before the loop condition failed. If `j` was `n` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop would not execute again. Therefore, `j` must be `n + 1` to indicate the loop has finished.

However, to show the state right before the loop condition fails (i.e., the state at the start of the next iteration that would make the loop execute one more time), we assume `j` was `n` at the end of the previous iteration, and thus at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `n + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50; `n` is an input integer such that `n` > 3; `j` is `n` + 1**
