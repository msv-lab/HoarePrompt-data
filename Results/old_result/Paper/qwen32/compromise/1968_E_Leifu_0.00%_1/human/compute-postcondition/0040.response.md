The `print` statement in the given Python code snippet concatenates the string representation of the variable `j` with a space and then again with the string representation of `j`.

From the initial state, we know that `j` is explicitly defined as 5. Therefore, the string representation of `j` is '5'.

The concatenation of '5', a space, and '5' results in the string '5 5'.

Output: **5 5**
