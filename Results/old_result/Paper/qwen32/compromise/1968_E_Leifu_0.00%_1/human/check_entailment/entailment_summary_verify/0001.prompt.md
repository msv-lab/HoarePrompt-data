You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

For n=5 a possible arrangement is:

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print('1 1')
        print('1 2')
        if n == 3:
            print('2 3')
        else:
            print('2 4')
            for j in range(4, n + 1):
                print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints a series of pairs of integers according to specific rules. It prints '1 1', '1 2', and then either '2 3' if `n` is 3, or '2 4' followed by each integer from 4 to `n` printed twice on its respective line if `n` is greater than 3.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The given program is supposed to output a set of n points in an n x n grid that maximizes the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of points. Let's analyze the program to see if it achieves this goal.

1. **First two points**: The program always starts by placing the first two points at (1, 1) and (1, 2). This is fine and will generate a Manhattan distance of 1 between these two points, along with a distance of 0 from each point to itself.

2. **Third point for n=3**: For n=3, it places the third point at (2, 3). This setup will generate additional Manhattan distances:
   - (1, 1) to (2, 3) -> |1-2| + |1-3| = 3
   - (1, 2) to (2, 3) -> |1-2| + |2-3| = 2
   - The set of distinct Manhattan distances will be {0, 1, 2, 3}, which is optimal for n=3.

3. **Fourth point for n=4**: For n=4, it places the fourth point at (2, 4). However, this placement does not maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances. Instead, it should consider a different configuration that provides more variety in distances.
   - The distances generated by this configuration will be less optimal compared to placing the points to maximize the variety of distances.
   - For example, placing the points at (1, 1), (1, 3), (4, 3), and (4, 4) would generate a more diverse set of distances, ensuring a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances.

4. **Subsequent points**: For n > 4, the program places points on the diagonal (j, j) starting from (4, 4). This placement pattern does not maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances either. A better strategy would be to place points in a way that spreads them out more evenly across the grid to cover a wider range of distances.

Given these points, the program does not always generate the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of n. Therefore, the program is not correct for all test cases.
