You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Let's analyze the code and the problem requirements:

1. **For \(n = 2\)**:
   - The code outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     ```
   - This is correct because the Manhattan distances are \(\{|1-1|+|1-1|, |1-1|+|2-2|, |1-1|+|1-2|\} = \{0, 0, 1\} = \{0, 1\}\), which gives a set size of 2.

2. **For \(n = 3\)**:
   - The code outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 3
     ```
   - The Manhattan distances are \(\{|1-1|+|1-1|, |1-1|+|2-2|, |1-1|+|3-2|, |1-2|+|1-1|, |1-2|+|2-2|, |1-2|+|3-2|, |2-3|+|1-2|\} = \{0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1\} = \{0, 1, 2\}\), which gives a set size of 3. This is correct.

3. **For \(n = 4\)**:
   - The code outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 4
     4 4
     ```
   - The Manhattan distances are:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     &\{|1-1|+|1-1|, |1-1|+|2-2|, |1-1|+|4-2|, |1-1|+|4-4|, \\
     &|1-2|+|1-1|, |1-2|+|2-2|, |1-2|+|4-2|, |1-2|+|4-4|, \\
     &|2-4|+|1-2|, |2-4|+|2-2|, |2-4|+|4-2|, |2-4|+|4-4|, \\
     &|4-4|+|1-4|\} \\
     &= \{0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 4, 0, 0\} \\
     &= \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}
     \end{align*}
     \]
   - This gives a set size of 5, which is correct.

4. **For \(n \geq 5\)**:
   - The code outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 4
     4 4
     4 5
     5 5
     ...
     n n
     ```
   - The pattern is not optimal for maximizing the number of distinct Manhattan distances. For example, for \(n = 5\):
     - The code outputs:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       2 4
       4 4
       4 5
       5 5
       ```
     - The Manhattan distances are:
       \[
       \begin{align*}
       &\{|1-1|+|1-1|, |1-1|+|2-2|, |1-1|+|4-2|, |1-1|+|4-4|, |1-1|+|5-4|, |1-1|+|5-5|, \\
       &|1-2|+|1-1|, |1-2|+|2-2|, |1-2|+|4-2|, |1-2|+|4-4|, |1-2|+|5-4|, |1-2|+|5-5|, \\
       &|2-4|+|1-2|, |2-4|+|2-2|, |2-4|+|4-2|, |2-4|+|4-4|, |2-4|+|5-4|, |2-4|+|5-5|, \\
       &|4-4|+|1-4|, |4-4|+|2-4|, |4-4|+|4-4|, |4-4|+|5-4|, |4-4|+|5-5|, \\
       &|4-5|+|4-4|, |4-5|+|5-4|, |4-5|+|5-5|, \\
       &|5-5|+|1-5|\} \\
       &= \{0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 0, 3, 2, 2, 0, 3, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0\} \\
       &= \{0, 1, 2, 3\}
       \end{align*}
       \]
     - This gives a set size of 4, which is not optimal. The optimal solution for \(n = 5\) should give a set size of 7 as shown in the example.

The pattern used in the code does not guarantee the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of \(n\). Therefore, the program is incorrect for \(n \geq 5\).

Thus, **Correctness: False**.
