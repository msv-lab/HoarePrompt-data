The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `c`, which is a list of integers with a length between 1 and 18, and each element in the list is between 0 and 10,000,000. The function prints specific lines based on whether `c` is equal to 2 (which is not possible as `c` is a list) or not, and always returns `None`.
