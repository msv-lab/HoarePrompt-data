Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array based on the given problem description. The function `func_1` only handles two specific cases and prints hardcoded values, which does not generalize to all possible input cases. 

Here are the specific issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program reads the input but does not convert the elements of the array `a` to integers. Instead, it keeps them as strings. This will lead to incorrect calculations and comparisons.
   
2. **Incorrect Logic**: The function `func_1` checks if the length of the array `c` is equal to 2 and prints hardcoded values. However, `c` is the length of the array, not the array itself. The logic does not compute the MEX of any subarray or perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array.

3. **Generalization Failure**: The function does not handle any input other than the hardcoded cases. It does not compute the MEX or perform the operations as required by the problem statement. 

4. **Specific Incorrect Outputs**: As mentioned in the original assessment, the program fails on specific test cases. For example, for the input `4` followed by `1 100 2 1`, the program prints `13 0`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `105 2` as shown in the problem description. Similarly, for the input `1` followed by `0`, the program prints `13 0`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1 1` followed by `1 1`.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for many potential cases.

Final: **False**
