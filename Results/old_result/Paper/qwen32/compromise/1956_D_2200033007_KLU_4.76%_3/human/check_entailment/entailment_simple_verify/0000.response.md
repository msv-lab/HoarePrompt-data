### Reasoning:
The original assessment is **correct**. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array based on the given problem description. The function `func_1` only handles two specific cases (when the length of the array is 2 and when it is not 2) and prints hardcoded values, which does not generalize to all possible input cases.

Let's break down the issues with the provided program:

1. **Hardcoded Outputs**:
   - When the length of the array is 2, the program outputs `4 1` followed by `1 2`.
   - For any other length, the program outputs `13 0`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Cases**:
   - **Case 1 (Length == 2)**:
     - The program assumes that the array `[0, 1]` will always result in a maximum sum of 4. However, this is not true for all arrays of length 2. For example, if the array is `[0, 0]`, the MEX is 1, and the array would become `[1, 1]` with a sum of 2. If the array is `[1, 2]`, the MEX is 0, and the array would become `[0, 0]` with a sum of 0.
   - **Case 2 (Length != 2)**:
     - The program assumes that the sum of the array is always 13 and no operations are needed, which is incorrect for most arrays. For example, if the array is `[1, 100, 2, 1]`, the correct output should be `105 2` as shown in the problem description.

3. **Lack of MEX Calculation**:
   - The program does not compute the MEX of any subarray and does not perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array. The MEX calculation and the operations to update the array are essential to solve the problem correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
The program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible input cases. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
