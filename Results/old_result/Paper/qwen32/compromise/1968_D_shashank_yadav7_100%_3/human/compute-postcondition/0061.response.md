Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is the input value; `k` is the input value; `i` is `k + 2`; `s` is the input value minus 1; `b` is the input value minus 1; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `a[s]`; `bp` is the cumulative sum of `a[b]` over `k + 1` iterations; `bm` is `a[b] * k`; `sm` is `a[s] * k`. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.**

In simple terms, the variable `sm` has been updated to be the product of `a[s]` and `k`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
