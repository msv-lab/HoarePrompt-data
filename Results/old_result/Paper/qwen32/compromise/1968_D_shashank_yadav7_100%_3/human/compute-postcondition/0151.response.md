Based on the provided initial state and the print statement, let's analyze what will be printed.

The initial state describes several variables and their relationships, but it does not specify the exact values of these variables or the specific operations that occur within the loop that updates `s`, `b`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm`. However, the print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of these variables.

Here's the relevant part of the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is the input value.
- `k` is `max(0, initial_k - n)`.
- `i` is `n + 2`.
- `s` and `b` are results of `p` list updates for `n` iterations.
- `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.
- `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.
- `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for `n` iterations.
- `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for `n` iterations.
- `bm` is the maximum `a[b] * k + bp` encountered during the loop.
- `sm` is the maximum `a[s] * k + sp` encountered during the loop.
- `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('Draw')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Draw'` regardless of the values of the variables described in the initial state.

Output: **Draw**
