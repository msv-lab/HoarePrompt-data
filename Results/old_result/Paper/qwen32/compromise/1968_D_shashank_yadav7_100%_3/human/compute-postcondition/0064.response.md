Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is 0; `i` is 2; `s` is the input value minus 1; `b` is the input value minus 1; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b]` (since `k + 1` is 1, `bp` is the cumulative sum of `a[b]` over 1 iteration); `bm` is `a[b] * 0`, which is 0; `sm` is `a[s] * 0`, which is 0. Since `bm` is equal to `sm`, the condition `bm > sm` is false.**

This postcondition retains all the conditions stated in the precondition and includes the additional information that `k` is 0, which is the current value of `k` after entering the if condition.
