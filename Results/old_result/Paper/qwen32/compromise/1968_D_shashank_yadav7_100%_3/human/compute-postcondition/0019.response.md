Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `k` is 0 if the condition `k == 0` is true, otherwise `k` is decreased by 1; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b]`; `bm` is `max(bp * k, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is `max(sp * k, a[s] * k + sp)`**

Explanation: The value of `sm` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (`sp * k`) and the expression `a[s] * k + sp`. All other variables remain unchanged.
