The code snippet assigns the value of `a[s] * k` to the variable `sm`. Given the initial state, `a[s]` is equal to `sp`, so `sm` will be equal to `sp * k`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n`, `k`, and `s` are the four integers obtained from the input, with `s` now being `s - 1`; `b` is the integer obtained from the input minus 1; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b]`; `bm` is `bp * k`; `sm` is `sp * k`.**
