Let's analyze the given code snippet in the context of the provided initial state.

The code snippet is:
```
bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `bm` is either `a[b] * (-1)` or `a[b] * (k - 1)`, depending on whether `k` is 0 or not.
- `bp` is `a[b]`.

Now, the code snippet updates `bm` to be the maximum of its current value and `a[b] * k + bp`.

Let's consider the two cases for `k`:

### Case 1: `k` equals 0
- `bm` is initially `a[b] * (-1)`.
- `a[b] * k + bp` becomes `a[b] * 0 + a[b] = a[b]`.
- The new `bm` will be `max(a[b] * (-1), a[b])`, which is `a[b]` because `a[b]` is greater than `a[b] * (-1)`.

### Case 2: `k` does not equal 0
- `bm` is initially `a[b] * (k - 1)`.
- `a[b] * k + bp` becomes `a[b] * k + a[b] = a[b] * (k + 1)`.
- The new `bm` will be `max(a[b] * (k - 1), a[b] * (k + 1))`, which is `a[b] * (k + 1)` because `k + 1` is greater than `k - 1`.

In both cases, the new value of `bm` is either `a[b]` (when `k` is 0) or `a[b] * (k + 1)` (when `k` is not 0).

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 3; `s` is `p[previous_s] - 1`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b]`. If `k` equals 0, then `bm` is `a[b]`. Otherwise, `bm` is `a[b] * (k + 1)`.**
