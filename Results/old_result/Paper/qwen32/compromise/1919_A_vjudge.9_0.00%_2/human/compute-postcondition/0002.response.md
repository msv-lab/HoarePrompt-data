In the given for loop, the loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable that doesn't need to be adjusted in the state. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `t`.

To ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The values of `a`, `b`, and `results` do not affect whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a <= 10^9 and 1 <= b <= 10^9; `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; `results` is an empty list.**
