The function `func_2` takes two integer parameters, `start_index` and `end_index`, which define a range within an array `arr`. It returns a list of tuples representing indices that satisfy certain conditions based on the values in `arr` and the results of calls to another function `func_1`. The function handles different cases: if the range length is 1 and the element is non-positive, it returns an empty list; if the range length is 1 and the element is positive, it returns a list with a single tuple of that index; if the maximum value condition is met, it returns a list with a single tuple of the range; otherwise, it recursively divides the range and combines results from subranges.
