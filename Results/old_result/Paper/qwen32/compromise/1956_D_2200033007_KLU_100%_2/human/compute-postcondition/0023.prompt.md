You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start_index and end_index are integers such that 0 <= start_index <= end_index < n, where n is the length of the array arr.

        #State: `start_index` and `end_index` are integers such that 0 <= `start_index` <= `end_index` < n, where n is the length of the array `arr`. The current value of `length` is 1, which means `end_index` is equal to `start_index`. `max_value` is the result of `func_1(start_index, end_index)` for this specific range. The element at `arr[start_index]` is less than or equal to 0.
        return [(start_index, start_index)]

Additionally, `length` is greater than 1, and `max_value` is not equal to `length`. It is also the case that `arr[start_index] + func_1(start_index + 1, end_index)` is not equal to `max_value`. Furthermore, `arr[end_index] + func_1(start_index, end_index - 1)` is not equal to `max_value`.
        #State: `start_index` and `end_index` are integers such that 0 <= `start_index` <= `end_index` < n, where n is the length of the array `arr`; `max_value` is the result of `func_1(start_index, end_index)`; `length` is `end_index - start_index + 1`. Additionally, `length` is greater than 1, and `max_value` is not equal to `length`. It is also the case that `arr[start_index] + func_1(start_index + 1, end_index)` is not equal to `max_value`. Furthermore, `arr[end_index] + func_1(start_index, end_index - 1)` is not equal to `max_value`.
    #State: `start_index` and `end_index` are integers such that 0 <= `start_index` <= `end_index` < n, where n is the length of the array `arr`; `max_value` is the result of `func_1(start_index, end_index)`; `length` is `end_index - start_index + 1`. Additionally, `length` is greater than 1, and `max_value` is not equal to `length`. It is also the case that `arr[start_index] + func_1(start_index + 1, end_index)` is not equal to `max_value`. Furthermore, `arr[end_index] + func_1(start_index, end_index - 1)` is not equal to `max_value`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `start_index` and `end_index`, which are integers such that 0 <= `start_index` <= `end_index` < n, where n is the length of an array `arr`. The function returns different values based on the following cases: Case_1: If `start_index` is greater than `end_index`, it returns an empty list. Case_2: If `start_index` is equal to `end_index`, it returns a list containing a single tuple `((start_index, start_index))`. Case_3: If `start_index` is less than `end_index`, it returns the result of `func_2(start_index + 1, end_index)`. Case_4: If any other conditions are met (which logically should not be possible given the constraints), it returns the result of `func_2(start_index, end_index - 1)`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns an empty list.

Case_2: The program returns [(start_index, start_index)]

Case_3: The program returns a list containing a single tuple `((start_index, end_index))`.

Case_4: The program returns the result of `func_2(start_index + 1, end_index)`

Case_5: The program returns the result of `func_2(start_index, end_index - 1)`
