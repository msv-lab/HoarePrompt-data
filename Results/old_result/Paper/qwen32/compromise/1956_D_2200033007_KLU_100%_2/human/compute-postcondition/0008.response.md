The value of `arr[start_index]` is set to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer representing the current step in the process of making stairs in the array `arr`, starting from the index `start_index`; `is_already_stairs` is `False` indicating that at least one `arr[start_index + j]` was not equal to `j` for `j` in `range(i + 1)`. The current value of `i` is 0; `res` is a list containing a single tuple `(start_index, start_index)`. `arr[start_index]` is 1.**
