To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze the logic and behavior of the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs`, and ensure they align with the problem requirements. Let's systematically evaluate the program using the annotated version and the original assessment.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function calculates the maximum possible sum of a subarray from `start_index` to `end_index` by recursively considering different ways to partition the subarray and computing the MEX for each partition.
   - **Memoization**: It uses a dictionary `res_dict` to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
   - **Cases**:
     - **Single Element**: If `start_index == end_index`, it returns `max(1, arr[start_index])`.
     - **Perfect Staircase**: If the subarray can be transformed into a perfect staircase (0, 1, 2, ..., length-1), the maximum sum is the square of the length (`(end_index - start_index + 1) ** 2`).
     - **Recursive Splitting**: Otherwise, it tries to split the subarray into smaller subarrays and compute the sum recursively.
   - **Annotations**: The annotations confirm that the function correctly handles these cases and uses memoization effectively.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function constructs the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.
   - **Logic**:
     - If the subarray length is 1 and the element is positive, no operations are needed.
     - If the subarray can be transformed into a perfect staircase, it calls `make_stairs` to generate the necessary operations.
     - Otherwise, it splits the subarray and recursively constructs operations for the partitions.
   - **Annotations**: The annotations confirm that the function correctly identifies when a perfect staircase can be formed and generates the appropriate operations.

3. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function generates the operations needed to transform a subarray into a perfect staircase (0, 1, 2, ..., length-1).
   - **Logic**:
     - It first checks if the subarray is already a perfect staircase.
     - If not, it recursively sets the elements of the subarray to the appropriate values and records the operations.
   - **Annotations**: The annotations confirm that the function correctly handles the transformation into a perfect staircase and records the operations.

### Potential Issues:
- **Global Variables**: The program uses global variables (`arr`, `res_dict`, `res`, `start_index`), which can lead to issues if the functions are called multiple times or if the program is run in a multi-threaded environment.
- **Memoization Key**: The memoization key in `func_1` is `(start_index, end_index)`, which is appropriate for the problem but the global nature of `res_dict` could cause issues if not reset between different runs.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases like subarray length 1 and perfect staircases, but it might not handle all edge cases explicitly, such as very small or very large values in the array.

### Evaluation:
- The logic in `func_1` and `func_2` is consistent with the problem requirements. The annotations confirm that the functions correctly calculate the maximum sum and generate the necessary operations.
- The function `make_stairs` correctly transforms the subarray into a perfect staircase and records the operations.
- The use of global variables and memoization is consistent but could be improved for better encapsulation and reusability.

### Conclusion:
Based on the annotations and the logical flow of the program, the program appears to be correct within the given constraints. The annotations validate the behavior of the functions and the correctness of the operations generated.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: True**
