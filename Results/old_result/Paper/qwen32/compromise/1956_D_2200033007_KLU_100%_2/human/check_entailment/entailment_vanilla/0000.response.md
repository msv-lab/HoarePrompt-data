Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to evaluate its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an array by performing a specific operation up to 500,000 times. The operation involves selecting a subarray, computing its MEX (minimum non-negative integer not present in the subarray), and setting all elements of the subarray to this MEX value.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - This function calculates the maximum possible sum of a subarray from `start_index` to `end_index` by recursively considering different ways to partition the subarray and computing the MEX for each partition.
    - It uses memoization (`res_dict`) to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
    - The function considers three main cases:
        1. If the subarray length is 1, the maximum value is either 1 or the current element, whichever is larger.
        2. If the subarray can be transformed into a perfect staircase (0, 1, 2, ..., length-1), the maximum sum is the square of the length.
        3. Otherwise, it tries to split the subarray into smaller subarrays and compute the sum recursively.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
    - This function constructs the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.
    - It recursively determines which subarray partitions yield the maximum sum and constructs the corresponding operations.
    - If the subarray can be transformed into a perfect staircase, it calls `make_stairs` to generate the necessary operations.
    - Otherwise, it splits the subarray and recursively constructs operations for the partitions.

3. **Function `make_stairs`**:
    - This function generates the operations needed to transform a subarray into a perfect staircase (0, 1, 2, ..., length-1).
    - It recursively sets the elements of the subarray to the appropriate values and records the operations.
    - If the subarray is already a perfect staircase, no operations are needed.

### Potential Issues:
- **Global Variables**: The program uses global variables (`arr`, `res_dict`, `res`, `start_index`) which can lead to issues if the functions are called multiple times or if the program is run in a multi-threaded environment.
- **Memoization Key**: The memoization key in `func_1` is `(start_index, end_index)`, which is appropriate for the problem but the global nature of `res_dict` could cause issues if not reset between different runs.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases like subarray length 1 and perfect staircases, but it might not handle all edge cases explicitly.
- **Correctness of Operations**: The operations generated by `func_2` and `make_stairs` need to be verified to ensure they correctly transform the array into the configuration that yields the maximum sum.

### Conclusion:
While the program seems to follow a logical approach to solve the problem, there are concerns regarding the use of global variables and the correctness of the operations generated. However, based on the provided examples and the logic described, the program appears to be correct within the given constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
