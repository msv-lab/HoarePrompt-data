Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The main issues are:

1. **Incorrect Implementation of MEX Calculation**: The program does not calculate the MEX of a subarray correctly. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the subarray. The current implementation does not perform this calculation.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Maximizing Sum**: The logic used in `func_1` and `func_2` to maximize the sum of the array is incorrect. It seems to try to maximize the sum by considering different partitions and values, but it does not correctly apply the MEX operation to achieve the maximum possible sum.

3. **Undefined Variables**: The variable `start_index` is used in `make_stairs` but is not defined within the scope of that function or passed as an argument.

4. **Incorrect Return Values**: The function `func_2` is supposed to return a list of operations, but it does not correctly handle the case when the maximum value is achieved by modifying the subarray.

5. **Global Variables**: The use of global variables `arr`, `res_dict`, and `res` without proper initialization or passing as arguments can lead to incorrect behavior.

To solve the problem correctly, you need to implement a strategy to find the MEX of each subarray and apply the operation to maximize the sum. One possible approach is to use a greedy strategy or dynamic programming to determine the optimal operations.
