Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are the key problems:

1. **Incomplete Implementation of `make_stairs` Function**:
   - The `make_stairs` function is called with an argument `i` but does not use the `start_index` variable, which is defined in `func_2`. This leads to incorrect array manipulation and incorrect results.
   - The `make_stairs` function modifies the array `arr` directly, but it does not ensure that the array is correctly transformed into a staircase pattern as intended.

2. **Incorrect Use of `res_dict`**:
   - The `res_dict` dictionary is used for memoization in `func_1` but is not defined anywhere in the provided code. This will result in a `NameError` when the function is called.
   - The `res_dict` should be initialized before using it in `func_1`.

3. **Global Variables**:
   - The code uses global variables like `arr`, `res_dict`, and `res` without defining them within the functions or passing them as parameters. This is bad practice and can lead to undefined behavior.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where the array is already in an optimal state or where the array has only one element correctly. For example, if the array is already a staircase pattern, the code may still perform unnecessary operations.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The code does not print the output in the required format. It should print the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves.

6. **Logic Errors**:
   - The logic for determining the maximum sum and the sequence of operations is not fully correct. The recursive approach in `func_1` and `func_2` may not cover all possible cases and may not always produce the optimal solution.

Here is a specific example where the code does not work correctly:

**Example Input:**
```
3
1 3 9
```

**Expected Output:**
```
13 0
```

**Actual Output:**
- The code will likely fail due to the issues mentioned above, and it may not produce the correct output.

Given these issues, the code is not correct for all potential cases, and therefore, the correctness is **False**.
