### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code, annotations, and the original assessment step-by-step to determine the correctness of the program.

#### 1. **Incomplete Implementation of `make_stairs` Function:**
   - The `make_stairs` function is called with an argument `i` but does not use the `start_index` variable, which is defined in `func_2`. This issue is noted in the original assessment.
   - The annotations confirm that `make_stairs` does not use `start_index` and directly manipulates the array `arr` without considering `start_index`. This is indeed a problem, as it will not correctly transform the intended subarray into a staircase pattern.

#### 2. **Incorrect Use of `res_dict`:**
   - The `res_dict` dictionary is used for memoization in `func_1` but is not defined anywhere in the provided code. This will result in a `NameError` when the function is called.
   - The annotations indicate that `res_dict` is used for memoization, and the original assessment correctly points out that `res_dict` should be initialized before use.

#### 3. **Global Variables:**
   - The code uses global variables like `arr`, `res_dict`, and `res` without defining them within the functions or passing them as parameters. This is poor practice and can lead to undefined behavior.
   - The annotations and original assessment both highlight the use of global variables without proper initialization or passing as parameters.

#### 4. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle cases where the array is already in an optimal state or where the array has only one element correctly.
   - The annotations do not explicitly address edge cases, but the original assessment correctly points out that the code may not handle these cases properly.

#### 5. **Output Format:**
   - The code does not print the output in the required format. It should print the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves.
   - The annotations and original assessment both note that the output format is incorrect.

#### 6. **Logic Errors:**
   - The logic for determining the maximum sum and the sequence of operations is not fully correct. The recursive approach in `func_1` and `func_2` may not cover all possible cases and may not always produce the optimal solution.
   - The annotations confirm that the logic in `func_1` and `func_2` is complex and may not cover all cases. The original assessment correctly points out potential logic errors.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the original assessment and confirmed by the annotations, the code is indeed incorrect. The problems with `make_stairs`, `res_dict`, global variables, edge cases, output format, and logic all contribute to the code not being a correct solution for the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
