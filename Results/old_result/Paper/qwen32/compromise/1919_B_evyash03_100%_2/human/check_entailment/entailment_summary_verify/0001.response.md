### Reasoning

The original assessment accurately identifies the flaws in the provided program. Let's break down the issues and confirm the reasoning:

1. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the penalty based on the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters. This approach does not align with the problem's requirement of minimizing the sum of penalties of subarrays.
   - The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The program does not calculate this penalty for any subarray.

2. **No Subarray Splitting**:
   - The program does not perform any splitting of the array into subarrays. It only calculates the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is not sufficient to determine the minimum penalty.

3. **No Optimization**:
   - The program does not attempt to find an optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty. It simply returns the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is not the correct solution.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Convert the string `s` into an array `a` where '+' is 1 and '-' is -1.
2. Try different ways to split the array `a` into subarrays.
3. Calculate the penalty for each possible split and choose the one with the minimum total penalty.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
