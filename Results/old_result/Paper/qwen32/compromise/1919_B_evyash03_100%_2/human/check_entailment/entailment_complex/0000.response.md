Reasoning:  
The provided program calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `expression`. However, this does not necessarily yield the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The problem requires an optimal splitting of the array to minimize the total penalty, which is calculated based on the absolute value of the sum of each subarray multiplied by its length.

The given function `func_1` does not perform any splitting or consider the penalty calculation as described. Instead, it simply computes the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters. This approach does not guarantee the minimum penalty because it does not explore different ways to split the array to minimize the penalty.

For example, consider the third test case in the problem statement:
```
6
+-+-+-
```
The correct minimum penalty is 0, which can be achieved by splitting the array into `([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1])`. However, the provided function would return `abs(3-3) = 0`, which is correct for this specific case but not because it follows the correct logic for all cases. In general, the function does not implement the correct algorithm to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
