To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand what the loop does. The loop iterates over each character in the string `expression`. If the character is '+', it increments the `count` variable by 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `expression` is a string of '+' and '-' characters.
- `length` is the length of the string `expression`.
- `count` is initialized to 0.

After the loop finishes, the value of `count` will be equal to the number of '+' characters in the string `expression`. The `expression` and `length` variables remain unchanged throughout the loop.

Hence, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **expression is a string consisting of the characters '+' and '-', length is a positive integer representing the length of the string such that length == len(expression), count is the number of '+' characters in the string expression.**
