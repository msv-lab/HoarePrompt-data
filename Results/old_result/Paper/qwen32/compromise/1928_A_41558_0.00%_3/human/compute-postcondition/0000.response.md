Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; `n` is an input integer.**

In this output state, `t`, `a`, and `b` retain their initial values and conditions. The variable `n` is assigned the value of the input integer.
