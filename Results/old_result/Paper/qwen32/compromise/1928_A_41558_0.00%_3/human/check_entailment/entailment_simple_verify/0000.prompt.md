You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: The variables `a` and `b` will hold the values of the last pair of integers input during the loop's execution, and `i` will be equal to `n`. The initial value of `t` and any other variables not affected by the loop will remain unchanged. The program will have printed 'YES', 'NO', or a combination of both based on the conditions evaluated for each pair of integers.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob has a rectangle of size `a x b`. He wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles and then form a new rectangle using these two smaller rectangles. The new rectangle must be different from the original one (considering rotations as the same).

### Key Points:
1. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it's impossible to cut the rectangle into two rectangles that can form a new different rectangle.
2. If one of the dimensions can be divided by 2, it's possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can form a new different rectangle.
3. If the rectangle can be cut in such a way that the resulting two rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions, the answer should be "YES". Otherwise, it should be "NO".

### Program Analysis:
The provided program checks:
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints "NO".
- If `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`, it prints "NO".
- Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Issues in the Program:
1. The condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:` is incorrect because it checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other, which is not the only way to form a different rectangle.
2. The program does not correctly handle all cases where a new rectangle can be formed. For example, a rectangle of size `4 x 3` can be cut into two `2 x 3` rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a `3 x 4` rectangle.

### Correctness Check:
Let's consider the following test cases:
- `a = 4`, `b = 3`: The program should print "YES" because the rectangle can be cut into two `2 x 3` rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a `3 x 4` rectangle.
- `a = 2`, `b = 2`: The program should print "YES" because the rectangle can be cut into two `1 x 2` rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a `2 x 2` rectangle (which is the same, but the code already handles this case correctly).
- `a = 1`, `b = 1`: The program should print "NO" because the rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles.
- `a = 3`, `b = 2`: The program should print "YES" because the rectangle can be cut into two `3 x 1` rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a `1 x 6` rectangle.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it incorrectly handles cases where one dimension is not exactly half of the other but can still be cut in a way to form a new rectangle.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The program fails to correctly identify all cases where a new rectangle can be formed. For example, it incorrectly handles the case where `a = 4` and `b = 3`. The correct approach would involve checking if the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.
