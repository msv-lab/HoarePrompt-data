### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem description to determine if the program is correct or incorrect.

#### Problem Recap:
Bob has a rectangle of size \( a \times b \) and wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles with integer sides and then form a new rectangle from those two smaller rectangles. Two rectangles are considered the same if one is a 90-degree rotation of the other.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Both dimensions are odd**: If both \( a \) and \( b \) are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle because he cannot cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
2. **One dimension is even**: If either \( a \) or \( b \) is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides and form a new rectangle unless the resulting smaller rectangles are \( 1 \times \frac{b}{2} \) or \( \frac{a}{2} \times 1 \). However, the problem description and examples suggest that even in cases where one dimension is exactly half of the other, a new rectangle can often be formed by rearranging the smaller rectangles.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program checks the following conditions:
1. **If both \( a \) and \( b \) are odd**: It prints "NO" because Bob cannot form a new rectangle.
2. **If \( a / 2 = b \) or \( b / 2 = a \)**: This condition seems incorrect. The program checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other, but this is not the only condition under which Bob cannot form a new rectangle. For example, if \( a = 6 \) and \( b = 3 \), Bob can cut the rectangle into two \( 3 \times 3 \) rectangles and form a \( 3 \times 6 \) rectangle, which is different from the original \( 6 \times 3 \) rectangle.
3. **Otherwise**: It prints "YES".

#### Issues in the Program:
- The condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:` is indeed incorrect. It should not be checking if one dimension is exactly half of the other. This condition is overly restrictive and incorrectly prevents valid configurations.
- The program should only check if both dimensions are odd to print "NO". If either dimension is even, Bob can always form a new rectangle.

#### Correct Program:
The correct program should only check if both dimensions are odd. If they are, print "NO". Otherwise, print "YES".

### Correctness:
The provided program is incorrect due to the incorrect condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:`. The correct program should only check if both dimensions are odd.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it incorrectly restricts valid configurations by checking if one dimension is exactly half of the other.
