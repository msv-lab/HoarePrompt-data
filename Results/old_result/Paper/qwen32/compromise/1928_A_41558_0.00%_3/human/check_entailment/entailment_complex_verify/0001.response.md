### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:` is incorrect. This condition is overly restrictive and does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements. Let's re-evaluate the program's logic based on the problem description:

1. **If both \( a \) and \( b \) are odd**: Bob cannot form a new rectangle because he cannot cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. This part of the program is correct.
2. **If either \( a \) or \( b \) is even**: Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides and form a new rectangle. The program should not have the condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:` because this condition is too specific and does not cover all cases where Bob can form a new rectangle.

The correct logic should be:
- If both \( a \) and \( b \) are odd, print "NO".
- Otherwise, print "YES".

The annotated code and the original assessment both highlight that the condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:` is incorrect, and the program should only check if both dimensions are odd.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the reasoning above, the original assessment is correct in identifying the issue with the program. The program should not include the condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:`. Therefore, the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
