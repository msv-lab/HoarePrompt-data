Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n
2. 1 ≤ b ≤ m
3. a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

### Key Observations

1. **GCD and Multiples**: For a + b to be a multiple of b * gcd(a, b), we can denote the gcd(a, b) as g. Then, a can be written as a = kg and b can be written as b = lg where k and l are coprime integers (gcd(k, l) = 1). The condition becomes:
   \[
   kg + lg = t \cdot (lg \cdot g) \implies k + l = t \cdot l \implies k = (t-1) \cdot l
   \]
   So, for each valid l (1 ≤ l ≤ m / g), we need to count the number of valid k (1 ≤ k ≤ n / g) such that k = (t-1) * l for some integer t.

2. **Iterative Approach**: For each b (from 1 to m), we need to find all valid a (from 1 to n) such that a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). This involves iterating through possible values of b and checking the conditions.

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the provided program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))
```

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Initialization of `ans`**: The initial value of `ans` is set to `n`, which is incorrect. It should be initialized to 0, and then all valid pairs should be counted.

2. **Loop Logic**: The loop starts from `count = 2` and goes up to `m`. The logic inside the loop seems to be incorrect for counting valid pairs. The program does not correctly implement the logic to check for multiples and gcd conditions.

3. **Incorrect Calculation**: The calculation inside the loop (`g = n / count`, `g -= countmins`, `ans += g / count + 1`) does not correspond to the problem's requirements. It does not correctly count the number of valid pairs (a, b).

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. It incorrectly initializes the answer and uses a flawed loop to count valid pairs.

**Correctness: False**
