`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables `n` and `m` are not affected by this input, and the constraints on `t`, `n`, and `m` remain valid.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The sum of `n` and the sum of `m` over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.**
