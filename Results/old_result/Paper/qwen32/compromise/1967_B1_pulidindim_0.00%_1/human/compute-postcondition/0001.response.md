The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts.

Since `t` is already given to be an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts as it will be set to 0 automatically when the loop begins.

Therefore, no changes are needed to the state of `t` for the loop to execute. The state of `i` does not need to be specified before the loop starts because it is controlled by the loop itself.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0 (automatically set by the loop)**

However, since `i` is automatically set by the loop, we can simply state that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and the loop will execute as intended.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
