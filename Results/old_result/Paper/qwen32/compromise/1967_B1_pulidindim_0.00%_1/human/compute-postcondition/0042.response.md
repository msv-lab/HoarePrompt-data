The value of `g` is decremented by `countmins`. Given that `g` is initially `n / 2` and `countmins` is 1, the new value of `g` will be `n / 2 - 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is `n`; `countmins` is 1; `g` is `n / 2 - 1`.**
