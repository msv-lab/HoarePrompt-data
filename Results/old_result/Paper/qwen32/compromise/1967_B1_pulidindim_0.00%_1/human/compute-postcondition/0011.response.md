Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `m` is at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is `n`; `countmins` is 1; `g` is `n / 2 - countmins`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Natural Language: The value of `g` is now `n / 2 - 1`. All other variables retain their initial values. If `g` is less than `countmins` (which is 1), the most internal loop or if statement will be broken out of.
