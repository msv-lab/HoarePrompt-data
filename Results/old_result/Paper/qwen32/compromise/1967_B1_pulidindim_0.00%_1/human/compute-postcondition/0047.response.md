Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is at least 3; `count` is 3; `ans` is `n + n / 4 + 0.5`; `countmins` is 2; `g` is `n / 3`.**

In this output state, the value of `g` has been updated to be `n / 3` as a result of the execution of the code `g = n / count`. All other variables retain their initial values.
