`g` is assigned the value of `n / count`. Given that `count` is 2, `g` becomes `n / 2`. The values of `t`, `m`, `count`, `ans`, and `countmins` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` must be at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is `n`; `countmins` is 1; `g` is `n / 2`.**
