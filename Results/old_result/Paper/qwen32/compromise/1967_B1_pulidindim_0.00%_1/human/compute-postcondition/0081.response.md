Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is equal to `n + g / count + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `countmins` is 1; `g` is `n / 2 - countmins`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the state remains unchanged as described.**

In natural language: The value of `g` is reduced by `countmins` (which is 1). All other variables remain unchanged. If after the reduction `g` is less than `countmins`, the state remains as originally described.
