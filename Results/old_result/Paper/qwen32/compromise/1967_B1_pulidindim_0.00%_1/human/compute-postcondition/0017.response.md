Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `m` must be greater than 3; `count` is 3; `ans` is `n + (n / 2 - countmins) / 2 + 1`; `countmins` is 2; `g` is `n / 3` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
