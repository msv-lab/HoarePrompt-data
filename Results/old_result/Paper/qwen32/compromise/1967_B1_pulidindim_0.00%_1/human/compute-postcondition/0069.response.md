The value of `g` is assigned the result of `n / count`. Given that `count` is 2, `g` will be `n / 2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` must be at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is equal to `n`; `i` is `i + 1`; `countmins` is 1; `g` is `n / 2`.**
