Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and arr is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and arr is sorted in non-decreasing order; `new_arr` is an empty list.**

In simple terms, the variable `new_arr` has been initialized as an empty list, while all other variables and their properties remain unchanged.
