### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the provided program and its function summary against the problem description to ensure correctness.

#### Program Analysis

The program processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three sorted integer scores (p_1, p_2, p_3). It checks if the sum of these scores is even, as an odd total score is impossible given the rules of the game. If the total score is even, it calculates the maximum possible number of draws based on the given scores.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description

1. **Total Points Calculation**: The total points awarded in a game are always even (either 2 for a win/loss or 2 for a draw).
2. **Maximum Draws**: The maximum number of draws can be determined based on the total points and the scores of the players.

#### Function Summary

The function summary states:
- The function checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the function outputs `-1`.
- If the sum is even, it calculates two values: half of the total sum and the sum of the two lower scores, then outputs the smaller of these two values.

#### Analysis of the Code

1. **Check for Even Total Points**:
   - The code correctly checks if the total points `(a + b + c) % 2 != 0` and returns `-1` if the total points are odd. This is correct because an odd total implies an impossible score distribution.

2. **Calculation of Maximum Draws**:
   - The code calculates `x = (a + b + c) // 2`, which represents the total number of games played.
   - It then calculates `y = a + b`, which represents the combined score of the two lower-scoring players.
   - The maximum number of draws is taken as `min(x, y)`.

#### Verification of Scenarios

Let's verify if the code handles all edge cases and potential scenarios:

- **No Games Played** (`a = 0, b = 0, c = 0`):
  - Total points = 0, which is even.
  - `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `min(x, y) = 0` → Correct.
  
- **One Draw** (`a = 0, b = 1, c = 1`):
  - Total points = 2, which is even.
  - `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `min(x, y) = 1` → Correct.
  
- **Impossible Scores** (`a = 1, b = 1, c = 1`):
  - Total points = 3, which is odd → Correctly returns `-1`.

- **Multiple Draws** (`a = 3, b = 3, c = 3`):
  - Total points = 9, which is odd → Correctly returns `-1`.

- **Valid Scores with Draws** (`a = 3, b = 4, c = 5`):
  - Total points = 12, which is even.
  - `x = 6`, `y = 7`, `min(x, y) = 6` → Correct.

- **Another Valid Case** (`a = 1, b = 1, c = 10`):
  - Total points = 12, which is even.
  - `x = 6`, `y = 2`, `min(x, y) = 2` → Correct.

#### Conclusion

The original assessment correctly states that the program handles all edge cases and potential scenarios as described in the problem statement. The logic for determining the maximum number of draws and checking for impossible scores is implemented correctly.

### Final Evaluation

**Final: True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
