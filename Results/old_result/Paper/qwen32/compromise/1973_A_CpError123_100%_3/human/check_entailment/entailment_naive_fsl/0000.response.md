Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program is intended to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players. Here's the provided code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        y = a + b
        print(min(x, y))
```

### Key Points from the Problem Description

1. **Total Points Calculation**: The total points awarded in a game are always even (either 2 for a win/loss or 2 for a draw).
2. **Maximum Draws**: The maximum number of draws can be determined based on the total points and the scores of the players.

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Check for Even Total Points**:
   - The code correctly checks if the total points `(a + b + c) % 2 != 0` and returns `-1` if the total points are odd, which is correct because an odd total implies an impossible score distribution.

2. **Calculation of Maximum Draws**:
   - The code calculates `x = (a + b + c) // 2`, which represents the total number of games played.
   - It then calculates `y = a + b`, which represents the combined score of the two lower-scoring players.
   - The maximum number of draws is taken as `min(x, y)`. 

### Potential Issues

Let's verify if the code handles all edge cases and potential scenarios:

- **No Games Played** (`a = 0, b = 0, c = 0`):
  - Total points = 0, which is even.
  - `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `min(x, y) = 0` → Correct.
  
- **One Draw** (`a = 0, b = 1, c = 1`):
  - Total points = 2, which is even.
  - `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `min(x, y) = 1` → Correct.
  
- **Impossible Scores** (`a = 1, b = 1, c = 1`):
  - Total points = 3, which is odd → Correctly returns `-1`.

- **Multiple Draws** (`a = 3, b = 3, c = 3`):
  - Total points = 9, which is odd → Correctly returns `-1`.

- **Valid Scores with Draws** (`a = 3, b = 4, c = 5`):
  - Total points = 12, which is even.
  - `x = 6`, `y = 7`, `min(x, y) = 6` → Correct.

- **Another Valid Case** (`a = 1, b = 1, c = 10`):
  - Total points = 12, which is even.
  - `x = 6`, `y = 2`, `min(x, y) = 2` → Correct.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the code and testing various scenarios, it appears that the program correctly handles all edge cases and potential scenarios as described in the problem statement. The logic for determining the maximum number of draws and checking for impossible scores is implemented correctly.

**Correctness: True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
