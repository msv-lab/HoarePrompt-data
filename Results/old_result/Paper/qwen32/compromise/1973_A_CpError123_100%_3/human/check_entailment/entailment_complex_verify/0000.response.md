### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Total Points Calculation**: The total points awarded in a game are always even (either 2 for a win/loss or 2 for a draw).
2. **Maximum Draws**: The maximum number of draws can be determined based on the total points and the scores of the players.

#### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Check for Even Total Points**:
   - The code correctly checks if the total points `(a + b + c) % 2 != 0` and returns `-1` if the total points are odd. This is correct because an odd total implies an impossible score distribution.

2. **Calculation of Maximum Draws**:
   - The code calculates `x = (a + b + c) // 2`, which represents the total number of games played.
   - It then calculates `y = a + b`, which represents the combined score of the two lower-scoring players.
   - The maximum number of draws is taken as `min(x, y)`.

#### Verification with Example Cases:
Let's verify the code with the provided example cases:

1. **No Games Played** (`a = 0, b = 0, c = 0`):
   - Total points = 0, which is even.
   - `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `min(x, y) = 0` → Correct.

2. **One Draw** (`a = 0, b = 1, c = 1`):
   - Total points = 2, which is even.
   - `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `min(x, y) = 1` → Correct.

3. **Impossible Scores** (`a = 1, b = 1, c = 1`):
   - Total points = 3, which is odd → Correctly returns `-1`.

4. **Multiple Draws** (`a = 3, b = 3, c = 3`):
   - Total points = 9, which is odd → Correctly returns `-1`.

5. **Valid Scores with Draws** (`a = 3, b = 4, c = 5`):
   - Total points = 12, which is even.
   - `x = 6`, `y = 7`, `min(x, y) = 6` → Correct.

6. **Another Valid Case** (`a = 1, b = 1, c = 10`):
   - Total points = 12, which is even.
   - `x = 6`, `y = 2`, `min(x, y) = 2` → Correct.

#### Additional Considerations:
- **Edge Cases**: The code handles edge cases such as no games played and impossible scores correctly.
- **Correctness**: The logic for determining the maximum number of draws and checking for impossible scores is implemented correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all edge cases and potential scenarios as described in the problem statement. The logic for determining the maximum number of draws and checking for impossible scores is implemented correctly. The annotations provided align with the expected behavior of the code.

**Final: True**
