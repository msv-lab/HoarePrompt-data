Let's analyze the given program step by step to see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` of three players.
- The scores are guaranteed to be in non-decreasing order: `p1 <= p2 <= p3`.
- If the scores are not possible with a valid set of games, the program should output `-1`.
- The total points `p1 + p2 + p3` must be even because each game contributes 2 points in total (either 2-0 or 1-1).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the scores.

2. **Even Total Points Check**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is even. If it's odd, it prints `-1` because the total points from all games must be even.
   - This is correct because each game results in 2 points being distributed among the players.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws**:
   - The program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This represents the total number of games played (since each game contributes 2 points).
   - The program calculates `y` as `a + b`. This represents the total points that players 1 and 2 have together.
   - The program then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`, which is intended to represent the maximum number of draws.

### Evaluation of the Logic:
- The logic for checking if the total points are even is correct.
- The calculation of `x` is correct as it represents the total number of games played.
- The calculation of `y` is also correct as it represents the total points of players 1 and 2.
- However, the logic to determine the maximum number of draws is flawed.

### Flaw in the Logic:
- The maximum number of draws cannot be simply the minimum of the total number of games and the combined points of two players.
- The correct approach would involve considering the constraints and the distribution of points more carefully. For example, the difference between `p3` and the sum of `p1` and `p2` must be even and non-negative, and the total points must be consistent with the possible game outcomes.

### Conclusion:
Given the flawed logic for determining the maximum number of draws, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
