The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three sorted integer scores. For each test case, it checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the function outputs `-1`. If the sum is even, it calculates two values: half of the total sum and the sum of the two lower scores, then outputs the smaller of these two values.
