For the given task, the only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The variable `_` is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use inside the loop, so we don't need to adjust its state. The loop will execute `t` times, so to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1.

Given that `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and it satisfies `1 ≤ t ≤ 500`, we need to ensure that `t` is within this range for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 500`**
