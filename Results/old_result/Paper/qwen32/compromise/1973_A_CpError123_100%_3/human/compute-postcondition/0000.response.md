Output State: **`t` is an input integer, each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the input, which is the number of test cases. The conditions and constraints on the scores of the players (p_1, p_2, p_3) and the number of test cases (t) remain unchanged.
