Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to convert times from the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. The logic in the program is implemented through a series of conditional statements that map each hour in the 24-hour format to its corresponding hour in the 12-hour format and determine whether the time is AM or PM. 

However, the implementation is not optimal and can be simplified. The program manually checks each hour from '00' to '23' and assigns the appropriate 12-hour format hour and AM/PM designation. This is functionally correct but can be streamlined using arithmetic operations to determine the 12-hour format hour and the AM/PM designation. 

Despite the suboptimal implementation, the program correctly converts the given 24-hour format times to the expected 12-hour format times based on the provided example inputs and outputs. Therefore, the program is correct in terms of functionality.

Correctness: **True**
