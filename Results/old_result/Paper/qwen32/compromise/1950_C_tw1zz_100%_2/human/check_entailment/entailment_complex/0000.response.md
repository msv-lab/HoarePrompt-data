### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. It reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads a time string in the format "hh:mm", converts the hour part to the corresponding 12-hour format, and appends "AM" or "PM" based on whether the original hour is in the first or second half of the day.

The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to map each hour from 00 to 23 to its corresponding hour in the 12-hour format and assigns the correct AM/PM designation. The minutes part remains unchanged during the conversion.

The program correctly handles special cases such as:
- Midnight (00:00) which should be converted to 12:00 AM.
- Noon (12:00) which should remain 12:00 PM.
- Hours from 13 to 23 which need to be converted to 1 to 11 PM.

The output format matches the required "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM" format, with leading zeroes preserved.
