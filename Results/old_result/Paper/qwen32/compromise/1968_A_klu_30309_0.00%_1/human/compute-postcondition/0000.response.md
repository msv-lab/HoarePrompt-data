The provided code snippet is a function definition and does not execute any code on its own. It describes a function that finds the value of `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y` given an integer `x`. Since no actual execution or assignment of variables happens in the provided snippet, the initial state remains unchanged. The function definition itself does not alter any variables or states directly.

Output State: **x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.**
