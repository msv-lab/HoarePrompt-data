To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which includes the variables `y`, `x`, and the range parameters `x - 1`, `1`, and `-1`.

The loop will execute if the range `(x - 1, 1, -1)` is non-empty. This means that the starting point (`x - 1`) must be greater than the stopping point (`1`), since the step is `-1` (indicating a decrement).

Given the current state:
- `x` is an integer such that `2 <= x <= 1000`
- `max_val` is 1

Let's analyze the range:
- The loop will start with `y` initialized to `x - 1`.
- The loop will continue as long as `y` is greater than `1`.
- The loop will decrement `y` by `1` in each iteration.

Since `x` is at least `2`, `x - 1` will be at least `1`. However, for the loop to execute at least once, `x - 1` must be strictly greater than `1`. Therefore, `x` must be at least `3`.

The variable `max_val` is not part of the loop head and does not affect whether the loop executes, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `x` is at least `3`.

State: **`x` is an integer such that `3 <= x <= 1000`, `max_val` is 1**
