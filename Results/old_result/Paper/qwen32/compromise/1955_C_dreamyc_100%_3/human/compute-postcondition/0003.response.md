Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. Additionally, `k` is less than the sum of the integers in `nums`. `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, and `b` is `k // 2`.**

In simpler terms, the values of `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain unchanged. The new variables `a` and `b` are calculated where `a` is the ceiling of `k` divided by 2, and `b` is the floor of `k` divided by 2.
