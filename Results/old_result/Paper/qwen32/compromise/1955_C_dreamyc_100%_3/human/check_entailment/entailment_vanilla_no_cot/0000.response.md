Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the number of ships sunk by the Kraken. The logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. The function attempts to calculate the number of ships sunk by summing the durability from the start and end of the list and comparing these sums to half of the total attacks, but this does not accurately simulate the Kraken's attack pattern.

Here's a brief explanation of why the current approach is incorrect:
- The Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ship that has not yet sunk.
- The provided logic does not correctly simulate this alternating pattern and does not account for the fact that once a ship sinks, it is no longer considered in subsequent attacks.
- The sums `s_a` and `s_b` only add up the durability of the ships in order from the start and end respectively, and do not account for the fact that ships can sink during the process, changing the order of attacks.

A correct approach would involve simulating the attacks while keeping track of which ships have sunk, which is more complex but necessary to accurately determine the number of ships sunk.
