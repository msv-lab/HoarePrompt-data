#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, and nums is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    if (k >= sum(nums)) :
        return n
        #The program returns the integer n, which is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. Additionally, `k` is less than the sum of the integers in `nums`.
    a, b = math.ceil(k / 2), k // 2
    ans = 0
    s_a = 0
    s_b = 0
    for i in range(n):
        s_a += nums[i]
        
        s_b += nums[n - i - 1]
        
        if s_a <= a:
            ans += 1
        
        if s_b <= b:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: `s_a` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `s_b` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, and `ans` is the count of iterations where `s_a` is less than or equal to `a` and `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the count of iterations where `s_a` is less than or equal to `a` and `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list of `n` integers `nums`. It returns `n` if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `nums`. Otherwise, it returns the count of iterations where the cumulative sum of elements from the start (`s_a`) is less than or equal to `a` (which is `math.ceil(k / 2)`) and the cumulative sum of elements from the end (`s_b`) is less than or equal to `b` (which is `k // 2`).
