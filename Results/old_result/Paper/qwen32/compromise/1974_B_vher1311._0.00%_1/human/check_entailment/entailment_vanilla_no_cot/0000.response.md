Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`. The program has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Replacement Logic**: The program attempts to replace characters in the string `s` directly, which is not the correct approach for decoding. The replacements should be based on the symmetric character mapping from the auxiliary string `r`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Unique Characters**: The program incorrectly handles the unique characters and their replacements. It uses `replace` which replaces all occurrences of a character at once, which is not what is needed for decoding.

3. **Incorrect Loop Logic**: The loop tries to modify the string `s` while iterating over it, which can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.

4. **Incorrect Construction of the Decoded String**: The program does not correctly construct the decoded string `s` from the encoded string `b`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = func_1(b)
        print(decoded_str)

def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    r = unique_chars[::-1]  # Reverse the list of unique characters
    mapping = {r[i]: unique_chars[i] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    decoded = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
    return decoded
```

In this corrected version:
- We first create the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters of `s` and then reversing it.
- We create a mapping from each character in `r` to its corresponding symmetric character in `unique_chars`.
- We then decode the string `s` by replacing each character with its mapped value from the dictionary `mapping`.
- Finally, we join the decoded characters to form the original string `s`.
