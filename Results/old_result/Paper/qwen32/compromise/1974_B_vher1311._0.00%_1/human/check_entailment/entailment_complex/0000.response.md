Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Logic for Decoding**: The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the string `b` by reversing the encoding process. However, the current implementation does not achieve this. Instead of mapping each character in `b` back to its corresponding character in the original string `s`, the function modifies the string `s` in a way that does not align with the described encoding process.

2. **Incorrect Replacement Logic**: The function attempts to replace each character in `b` with a character from `unique_chars` in reverse order. However, it does this in a loop that modifies the string `s` directly, which is incorrect. The replacement should be based on a mapping from each character in `b` to its corresponding character in the original string `s`.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Unique Characters**: The function maintains a list `unique_chars` of unique characters in `b` in sorted order. However, it does not use this list to map characters back to their original positions in the encoded string `b`. Instead, it attempts to replace characters in `b` directly, which leads to incorrect results.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the concatenation of `unique_chars`, which is not the decoded string `s`. The correct return value should be the decoded string `s`.

To fix the program, we need to:
- Construct the sorted list `unique_chars` of unique characters in `b`.
- Create a mapping from each character in `unique_chars` to its symmetric character.
- Use this mapping to decode the string `b` back to `s`.

Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
    return decoded_str

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = func_1(b)
        print(decoded_str)
```

Correctness: **False**
