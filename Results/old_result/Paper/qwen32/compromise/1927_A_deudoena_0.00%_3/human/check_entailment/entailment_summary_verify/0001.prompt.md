You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program:
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a string `s` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' present, and outputs the minimum number of swaps needed to bring all 'B's together in the string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find the minimum length of a continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the entire strip to become white. The input consists of a number of test cases, each with a string representing the strip of cells.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by identifying the first and last black cell in the strip. It then calculates the minimum segment length that needs to be painted white as the distance between these two black cells plus one (since the segment is inclusive).

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The code assumes that the input is a single string representing the strip of cells, without handling multiple test cases.
2. **Index Calculation**: The code correctly identifies the first and last black cell, but the formula used to calculate the minimum segment length is incorrect. The formula `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` does not correctly compute the length of the segment between the first and last black cell.
3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle the case where there is only one black cell correctly.

### Correct Approach:
- For each test case, find the index of the first black cell (`ind1`) and the index of the last black cell (`ind2`).
- The minimum segment length to paint all cells white is `ind2 - ind1 + 1`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input().strip())  # Read the number of test cases
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())  # Read the length of the strip
        s = input().strip()  # Read the strip
        ind1 = -1
        ind2 = -1
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] == 'B':
                if ind1 == -1:
                    ind1 = i  # First black cell
                ind2 = i  # Last black cell
        # The minimum length of the segment to paint white
        print(ind2 - ind1 + 1)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incorrect due to improper handling of multiple test cases and incorrect calculation of the segment length.
