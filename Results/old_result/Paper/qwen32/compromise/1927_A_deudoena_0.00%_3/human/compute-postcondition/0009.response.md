Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the length of a string `s` and a string `s` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' present. The function returns the minimum number of swaps needed to bring all 'B's together in the string `s`.**
