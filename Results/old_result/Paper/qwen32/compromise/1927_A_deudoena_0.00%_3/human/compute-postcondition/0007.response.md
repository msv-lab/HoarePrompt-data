To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The loop iterates over the string `inpstr` from the last character to the first. It checks if the current character is 'B'. If it finds a 'B', it sets `ind2` to the index of that character (relative to the end of the string) and breaks out of the loop.

Given that `ind2` is initially 0 and the loop finds the first 'B' from the end of the string, `ind2` will be set to the position of this 'B' counted from the end. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `inpstr`, `ind1`, and `outind`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Let's summarize the output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' present in `s`; `inpstr` is assigned the value of `input()`; `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`; `ind2` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' from the end of `inpstr`; `outind` is 0.**
