The value of `b` is updated to the value of `l[x]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `x`, and the conditions for `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `x` is `k + 1`; if `a` was greater than `b`, then `a` is now the previous value of `b` and `b` is now the previous value of `a`, otherwise `a` and `b` remain unchanged; `b` is `l[x]`.**
