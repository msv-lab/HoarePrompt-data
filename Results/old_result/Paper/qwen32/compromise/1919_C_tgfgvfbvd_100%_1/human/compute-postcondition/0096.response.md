The code snippet `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. The initial state specifies that `c` is 0, so after the execution, `c` will be 1. Other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `a`, `b`, and `l[x]`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers; `a` is `l[x]`; `b` is `float('inf')`; `c` is 1; and `l[x]` is greater than `b`.**
