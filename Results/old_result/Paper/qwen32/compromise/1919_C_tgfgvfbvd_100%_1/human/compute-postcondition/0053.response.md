Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is `float('inf')`; `b` is `l[x]`; `c` is 0; `l[x]` is greater than `a`; and `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to `l[x]`. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
