Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers; `l[x]` is greater than `a`. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]` and `a` remains `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `a` is updated to `l[x]`, `b` remains `float('inf')`, and `c` is set to 1.**
