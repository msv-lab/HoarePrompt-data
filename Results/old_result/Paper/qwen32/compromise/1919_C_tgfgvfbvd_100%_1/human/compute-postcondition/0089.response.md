Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is `float('inf')`; `b` is `float('inf')`; `c` is 0. The element at index `x` in list `l` is less than or equal to `a`. Since `a` was initially `float('inf')`, the current value of `a` is `l[x]`. The values of `b` and `c` remain unchanged.**
