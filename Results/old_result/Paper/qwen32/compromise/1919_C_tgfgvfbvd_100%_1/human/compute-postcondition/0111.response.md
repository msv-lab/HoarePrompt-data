Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is `l[x]`; if `a > b`, then `a` is the previous value of `b` and `b` is the previous value of `a`; `c` is incremented by 1 if `l[x] > b` in the previous iteration; `x` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**

In simple terms, the value of `a` is now set to the value of `l[x]`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `b`, `c`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
