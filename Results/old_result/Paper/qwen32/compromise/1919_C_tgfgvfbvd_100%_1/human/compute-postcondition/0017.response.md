Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is not greater than `b`; the element `l[x]` is greater than `a`. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is set to `l[x]` and `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `a` is set to `l[x]`, `b` is set to `float('inf')`, and `c` is set to 1.**
