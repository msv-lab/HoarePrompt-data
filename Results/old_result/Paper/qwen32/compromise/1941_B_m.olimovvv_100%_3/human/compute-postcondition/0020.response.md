The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only terminates the loop or control structure it is inside. Therefore, the values of `t`, `a`, `b[i]`, `b[i + 1]`, `b[i + 2]`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is an integer greater than 2, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is updated to `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
