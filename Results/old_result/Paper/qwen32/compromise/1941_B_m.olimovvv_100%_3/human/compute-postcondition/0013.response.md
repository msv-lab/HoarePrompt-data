The `break` statement in the provided code snippet will terminate the loop or block it is contained within, but it does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b[i]`, `b[i + 1]`, `b[i + 2]`, or `i` directly. Since the `break` statement does not modify any variables, the values of these variables remain as they were before the `break` statement was encountered.

Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State, except that we note the `break` has caused the loop to terminate.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is an integer greater than 2, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is updated to `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` is updated to `b[i + 2] - b[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
