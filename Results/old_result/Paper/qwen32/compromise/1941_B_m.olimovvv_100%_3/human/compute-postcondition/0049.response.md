The code snippet provided is `b[i + 2] -= b[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2. Therefore, the expression `i + 2` evaluates to 4, and the operation modifies `b[4]` by subtracting `b[2]` from it. 

The initial state specifies that `b[3]` is `b[3] - 2 * b[2]`, but since we are modifying `b[4]`, this detail about `b[3]` remains unchanged. The value of `b[2]` remains unchanged as per the initial state description.

So, the operation `b[4] -= b[2]` modifies `b[4]` to be `b[4] - b[2]`.

Output State: **`a` is at least 4, `b` is a list of integers where `b[0]` is 0, `b[1]` is 0, `b[2]` remains unchanged, `b[3]` is `b[3] - 2 * b[2]`, and `b[4]` is `b[4] - b[2]`, `i` is 2.**
