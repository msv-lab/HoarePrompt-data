In the given task, the for loop iterates based on the value of `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the function `input()`. However, the state before the loop starts includes `t`, `n`, and `a`, which are essential for the loop body to execute properly in each test case.

Since the loop head only involves the variable `_` and the `input()` function, we need to ensure that the input function will provide the correct number of test cases, `t`, and that each test case will provide the correct `n` and `a` list.

The state of `t` is already given and does not need adjustment for the loop to execute. However, for each iteration of the loop, the input must provide valid `n` and `a`.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and the input must provide `n` and `a` for each of the `t` test cases, where `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 <= `a_j` <= 10^9.**

Since the loop head only involves `_` and `input()`, we ensure that the input is structured correctly for each iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and the input must provide valid `n` and `a` for each of the `t` test cases.**
