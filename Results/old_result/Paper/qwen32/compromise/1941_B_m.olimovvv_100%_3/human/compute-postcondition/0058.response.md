The `break` statement in the provided code snippet will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in. However, since no loop or conditional block is specified in the given context, we can assume that the `break` statement is intended to exit a loop or block that surrounds this code snippet. The values of `a` and `b[i]` remain unchanged by the `break` statement itself.

Output State: **`a` must be at least 2, and `b[i]` is less than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
