The code snippet provided only updates the variable `a` by reading an integer input from the user. The variable `t` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `a` while `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is an input integer.**
