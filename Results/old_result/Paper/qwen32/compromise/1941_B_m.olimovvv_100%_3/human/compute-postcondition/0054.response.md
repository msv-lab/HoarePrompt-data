The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `b`. 

Given the initial state, the values of `a` and the conditions related to the elements of `b` are not directly affected by this line of code. The only change is that `b` is now assigned the list of integers from the input.

Output State: **The first `a - 2` elements of `b` are 0, and the final output is 'YES' if `b[-2] == 0` and `b[-1] == 0`; otherwise, it is 'NO'. The loop variable `_` is incremented by 1. `a` is an input integer. `b` is a list of integers read from the input.**
