Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Indexing and Logic**: The program iterates through the array and adjusts the values of `b[i+1]` and `b[i+2]` based on `b[i]`, but this approach does not correctly simulate the operations described in the problem. The operation can only be performed if `b[i-1]`, `b[i]`, and `b[i+1]` are sufficient, and the program does not correctly check this condition.

2. **Negative Values**: The program checks for negative values in the array, but this check is not sufficient to determine the feasibility of making all elements zero. Negative values can arise from incorrect adjustments, but they do not necessarily mean that it's impossible to make all elements zero.

3. **Final Check**: The final check `if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0` is not sufficient to determine if all elements can be zero. The program does not ensure that all elements before the last two have been correctly reduced to zero.

Here is a more correct approach to solve the problem:

1. **Check Parity**: The sum of all elements in the array must be even because each operation reduces the sum by 4 (2 from `a_i` and 1 from `a_{i-1}` and `a_{i+1}`).

2. **Simulate Operations**: Use a greedy approach to simulate the operations starting from the beginning of the array. Ensure that each element can be reduced to zero by the operations described.

Here is a correct implementation:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the sum of the array is even
        if sum(a) % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Try to make all elements zero
        for i in range(n - 2):
            if a[i] > 0:
                if a[i + 1] >= a[i] and a[i + 2] >= a[i]:
                    a[i + 1] -= a[i]
                    a[i + 2] -= a[i]
                    a[i] = 0
                else:
                    print('NO')
                    break
        else:
            if a[-1] == 0 and a[-2] == 0:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

This implementation correctly checks the feasibility of making all elements zero by simulating the operations and ensuring that the sum of the array is even.
