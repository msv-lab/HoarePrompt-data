### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code and its behavior against the problem description.

#### Function 1 (`func_1`):
- **Purpose**: To compute the number of possible initial arrays `a` that can result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
- **Logic**: It uses dynamic programming to simulate the generation of prefix sums and counts the number of ways to achieve the final prefix sum value `p[-1]` after `n` steps.
- **Issue**: According to the output hints, regardless of the input values, the function always returns 0. This is incorrect because, as shown in the problem examples, there are cases where the number of possible arrays `a` is non-zero.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`):
- **Purpose**: To read multiple test cases from standard input, process each test case using `func_1`, and print the results.
- **Logic**: It correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.
- **Issue**: Since `func_1` always returns 0, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
The primary issue lies in `func_1`. The function's logic is flawed, as it does not correctly compute the number of possible initial arrays `a` that can lead to the given sorted prefix sum array `p`. Therefore, the entire program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
