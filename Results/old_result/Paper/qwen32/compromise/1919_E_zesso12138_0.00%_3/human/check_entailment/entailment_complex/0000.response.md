### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to count the number of initial arrays `a` such that their sorted prefix sums match the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
- The result should be modulo `998,244,353`.

#### Code Analysis:
- The main function `func_2()` handles reading multiple test cases and calls `func_1(n, p)` for each test case.
- `func_1(n, p)` is supposed to compute the number of valid initial arrays `a` for a given `n` and `p`.
- Inside `func_1(n, p)`, a dynamic programming (DP) approach is used to count the number of ways to achieve the given prefix sums.
- The DP table `dp` is initialized with `dp[offset] = 1`, where `offset = n` to handle negative indices.
- The DP table is updated by considering adding `1` or `-1` to the current prefix sum.
- Finally, the function returns `dp[final_sum]`, where `final_sum = p[-1] + offset`.

#### Issues in the Provided Code:
- The provided code has a critical flaw in the final return statement. It always returns `dp[final_sum]`, which is not necessarily the correct count of valid initial arrays `a`.
- The DP table `dp` is updated correctly, but the final result is not computed correctly because the problem requires counting the number of valid sequences that can produce the exact sorted prefix sums `p`, not just the final sum.
- The DP table should account for the specific sequence of prefix sums, not just the final sum.

#### Correct Approach:
- A correct approach would involve ensuring that the DP table correctly counts the number of sequences that can produce the exact sorted prefix sums `p`.
- This typically involves checking that the transitions between prefix sums are valid and that the final sorted sequence matches `p`.

Given the issues identified, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incorrect because it does not correctly count the number of valid initial arrays `a` that produce the given sorted prefix sums `p`.

**Correctness: False**
