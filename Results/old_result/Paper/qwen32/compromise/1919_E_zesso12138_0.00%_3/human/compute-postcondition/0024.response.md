The code snippet increments the variable `index` by the value of `n`. This change affects only the `index` variable, while all other variables retain their previous values.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is `int(data[3 + 2*old_n])`
- `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`
- `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer
- `index` is `3 + 2*int(data[3 + 2*old_n]) + 1`
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`
- `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the value returned by `func_1(old_n, p)`
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(old_n, p)`

After executing `index += n`, the new value of `index` is `3 + 2*int(data[3 + 2*old_n]) + 1 + int(data[3 + 2*old_n])`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is `int(data[3 + 2*old_n])`; `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer; `index` is `3 + 2*int(data[3 + 2*old_n]) + 1 + int(data[3 + 2*old_n])`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the value returned by `func_1(old_n, p)`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(old_n, p)`**.
