To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the function call `result = func_1(n, p)`. Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. However, we know that `result` will be assigned whatever value `func_1(n, p)` returns.

Here are the variables and their states before the function call:
- `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.
- `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[2:2+n]`.
- `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer.
- `index` is `2 + n`.
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
- `results` is an empty list.

After the function call, `result` will be assigned the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[2:2+n]`; `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer; `index` is `2 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`**.
