The code increments the value of `index` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[3 + 2*old_n])`; `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + old_n]`; `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer; `index` is `3 + 2*int(data[3 + 2*old_n]) + 1`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the value returned by `func_1(old_n, p)`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(old_n, p)`**.

In simpler terms, `index` has been increased by 1, while all other variables retain their original values.
