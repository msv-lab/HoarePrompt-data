Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer; `index` is `3 + 2*n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0] - 1`; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value of `result`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`**

Explanation: The value of `index` is incremented by `n`, changing its value from `3 + n` to `3 + 2*n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
