Output State: **`dp` is a list of zeros of length `2 * n + 1`, and `new_dp` is a list of zeros of length `2 * n + 1`. `dp` now references the same list object as `new_dp`.**

Natural Language Explanation: After executing the code, both `dp` and `new_dp` reference the same list object, which is a list of zeros of length `2 * n + 1`. No other changes occur to the variables or their values.
