To determine the new state after executing the given Python code, let's analyze the impact of the line `n = int(data[index])` on the existing variables.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`.
- `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`.
- `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer.
- `index` is `3 + 2*n`.
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
- `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`.
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`.

### Code Execution:
The line `n = int(data[index])` reassigns the value of `n` to the integer value of the string at `data[index]`.

### New Value Calculation:
- `index` is initially `3 + 2*n`.
- After the reassignment, `n` becomes `int(data[index])`. This means `n` now holds the integer value of the string located at position `3 + 2*old_n` in the `data` list, where `old_n` was the previous value of `n`.

### Updated State:
- `n` is now `int(data[3 + 2*old_n])`.
- `p` remains unchanged as it depends on the old value of `n` and `index`.
- `data` remains unchanged.
- `index` is recalculated as `3 + 2*n` using the new value of `n`.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `results` remains unchanged as it depends on the old values of `n` and `p`.
- `result` remains unchanged as it depends on the old values of `n` and `p`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`n` is `int(data[3 + 2*old_n])`; `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + old_n]`; `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer; `index` is `3 + 2*int(data[3 + 2*old_n])`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the value returned by `func_1(old_n, p)`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(old_n, p)`**.
