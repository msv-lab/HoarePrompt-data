Output State: **`n` is `int(data[3 + 2*old_n])`; `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer; `index` is `3 + 2*int(data[3 + 2*old_n]) + 1 + int(data[3 + 2*old_n])`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the value returned by `func_1(old_n, p)`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`**

Explanation: The variable `result` is updated to hold the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`. All other variables retain their initial values.
