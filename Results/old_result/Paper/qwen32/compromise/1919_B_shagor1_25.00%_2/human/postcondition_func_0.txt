The function `func_1` processes each test case by reading an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-' characters. It calculates and prints the result as `n - 2 * neg` if the string contains both '+' and '-' characters, or if there are more '+' characters than '-' characters. If the string contains only '-' characters, it prints `n`.
