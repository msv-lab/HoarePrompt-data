Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the number of '-' characters in the string `s` (denoted as `neg`) and then computing the result based on the condition `n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n`. However, this approach does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement.

The problem requires splitting the array `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that the sum of penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program simplifies the problem incorrectly by only considering the count of '-' characters and does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty. 

For example, in the third test case:
- Input: `+-+-+-`
- The program calculates `n - 2 * neg` which is `6 - 2 * 3 = 0`. This is correct because the optimal split is `([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1])`, and both subarrays have a penalty of 0.
- However, the program does not generalize this to other cases correctly. For instance, in the fourth test case:
- Input: `--+++++++-`
- The program calculates `n - 2 * neg` which is `10 - 2 * 3 = 4`. This is correct for this particular input, but it does not guarantee the minimum penalty for all inputs.

The program does not incorporate the logic to find the optimal splits that minimize the total penalty, which is essential for solving the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
