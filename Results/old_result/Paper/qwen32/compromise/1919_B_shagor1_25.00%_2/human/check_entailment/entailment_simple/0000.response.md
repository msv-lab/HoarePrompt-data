Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty based on the problem description. The logic in the program calculates `n - 2 * neg` or `n` based on the count of '-' characters in the string, which does not align with the penalty calculation rules described.

The penalty for a split is defined as the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length. The goal is to find the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty. The provided solution does not attempt to find any optimal splitting strategy; it simply computes a value based on the count of '-' characters, which is not a valid approach to solving the problem.

For example, consider the test case `--+++++++-`. The optimal split would be `(--), (+++), (+++), (-)`, which results in a total penalty of `4`. However, the program would output `10 - 2 * 5 = 0`, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
