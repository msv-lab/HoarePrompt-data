Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine if the program correctly computes the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement.

### Problem Recap
The task is to find the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`, where:
- `a_i = 1` if `s_i = '+'`
- `a_i = -1` if `s_i = '-'`

The penalty for a subarray `c` is calculated as:
- `p(c) = |sum(c)| * len(c)`

The goal is to split `a` into subarrays such that the sum of penalties for all subarrays is minimized.

### Key Insight
The optimal strategy involves forming subarrays where the sum is zero (`0`), as this would result in a penalty of `0`. If the entire array can be split into such subarrays, the total penalty will be `0`.

### Detailed Analysis
1. **Counting '+' and '-'**:
   - The program counts the number of `'-'` characters in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `neg`.
   - The number of `'+'` characters can be derived as `n - neg`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

2. **Calculating the Penalty**:
   - If the number of `'+'` characters equals the number of `'-'` characters (`n == 2 * neg`), then it is possible to split the array into subarrays with a sum of `0`, resulting in a total penalty of `0`.
   - Otherwise, the minimum penalty is `n - 2 * neg`. This formula essentially calculates the number of characters that cannot be paired to form a subarray with a sum of `0`.

### Annotations and Code Review
Let's review the annotations and the code systematically:

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    func_1()
    t -= 1

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    neg = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '-':
            neg += 1
        
    #State: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000) representing the length of the string `s`; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-' characters; `neg` is the count of '-' characters in the string `s`.
    print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)
    #This is printed: - The output will be `n - 2 * neg` if the string contains both '+' and '-' characters, or if there are more '+' characters than '-' characters.
    #   - The output will be `n` if the string contains only '-' characters.
    #
    #Based on the above analysis, the output of the print statement can be described as follows:
    #
    #Output:
```

### Verification with Test Cases
Let's verify the program with the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `n = 1`, `s = '+'`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: `a = [1]`, cannot form a subarray with sum `0`, penalty is `1`.
   - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `s = '-----'`
   - Output: `5`
   - Explanation: `a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`, cannot form subarrays with sum `0`, penalty is `5`.
   - Program Output: `5` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `n = 6`, `s = '+-+-+-'`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: `a = [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]`, can be split into `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])`, penalty is `0`.
   - Program Output: `0` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `n = 10`, `s = '--+++++++-'`
   - Output: `4`
   - Explanation: `a = [-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]`, can be split into `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [-1])`, penalty is `4`.
   - Program Output: `4` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5**:
   - Input: `n = 20`, `s = '+---++++-+++++---++-'`
   - Output: `4`
   - Explanation: `a = [1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, -1]`, can be split into multiple subarrays with minimal penalty, resulting in `4`.
   - Program Output: `4` (Correct)

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty based on the described strategy. It correctly handles all the test cases.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
