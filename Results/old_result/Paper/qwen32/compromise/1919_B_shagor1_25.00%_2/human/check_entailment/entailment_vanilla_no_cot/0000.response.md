Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty based on the problem description. The program simply calculates the difference between the total length of the string and twice the count of '-' characters, which does not account for the optimal splitting strategy described in the problem.

To solve the problem correctly, one should consider splitting the array in such a way that the sum of penalties of the resulting subarrays is minimized. This involves a more complex algorithm, typically dynamic programming or a greedy approach, to find the optimal split points.

Here's a brief outline of a correct approach:
1. Traverse the string and keep a running sum of the values (1 for '+', -1 for '-').
2. Whenever the running sum returns to zero, it indicates a potential optimal split point, as the penalty for such a segment is zero.
3. If the running sum does not return to zero, one must carefully consider where to split to minimize the penalties of the resulting segments.

The provided code does not implement this logic and thus is incorrect.
