Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The program simply counts the number of '-' characters and computes a value based on that count, which does not align with the penalty calculation rules given.

Let's break down why this is incorrect:

1. **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The program does not consider subarrays or their sums at all.

2. **Optimal Splitting**: The program does not attempt to find an optimal way to split the array into subarrays to minimize the total penalty. It only considers the total number of '-' characters and computes a simple value, which is not an optimal strategy.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `--+++++++-`, the program calculates the number of '-' characters (4) and outputs `10 - 2 * 4 = 2`. However, the correct minimum penalty is `4`, which can be achieved by splitting the array into optimal subarrays.

To correctly solve this problem, a dynamic programming approach or a greedy strategy that considers the optimal way to split the array into subarrays based on their sums is needed. The provided program does not implement such logic.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:
- **Input**: `10\n--+++++++-`
- **Expected Output**: `4`
- **Actual Output**: `2`

Thus, the program is incorrect.
