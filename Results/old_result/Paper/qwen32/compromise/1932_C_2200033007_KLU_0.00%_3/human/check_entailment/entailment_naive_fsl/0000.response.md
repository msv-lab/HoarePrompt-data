Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` when divided by `m` at each step. Instead, it seems to be appending elements to a list `b` based on the commands and then computing the product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, which is not the intended behavior.

Here's a breakdown of why the code is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Product Calculation**:
   - The code appends elements to `b` based on the commands, but it does not compute the product of the current state of the array `a` at each step.
   - It computes the product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, which is not what is required.

2. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The problem requires computing the remainder of the product of the current state of the array `a` when divided by `m` at each step, but the code does not perform this operation correctly.

3. **Incorrect Output**:
   - The output of the program is not the remainders of the product of the current state of the array `a` when divided by `m` at each step.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    ans = []
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        ans.append(product % m)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            product = (product * a.pop(0)) % m
        else:
            product = (product * a.pop()) % m
    return ans
```

In this corrected version:
- The product of the current state of the array `a` is computed at each step.
- The modulo operation is applied at each step to ensure the product does not exceed the limits.
- The remainders are appended to the `ans` list and returned as the output.

The original code fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, hence the correctness is **False**.
