Functionality: **The function takes four parameters: an integer `n`, a positive integer `m`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'. It constructs a new list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the characters in `s` ('L' for left end, 'R' for right end). It then calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order and returns this list.**
