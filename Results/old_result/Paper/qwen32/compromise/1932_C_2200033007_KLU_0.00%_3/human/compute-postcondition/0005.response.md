The provided code snippet initializes an empty list `ans`. None of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `b`, `l`, `r`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list of n integers constructed by picking elements from `a` as guided by `s` (picking from the left end of `a` if `s[i]` is 'L' and from the right end if `s[i]` is 'R'), `l` is n (since it would have been incremented `n` times if all characters were 'L'), and `r` is -1 (since it would have been decremented `n` times if all characters were 'R'), `ans` is an empty list.**
