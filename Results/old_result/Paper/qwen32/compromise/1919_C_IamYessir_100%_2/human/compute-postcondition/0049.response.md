The code assigns the value of the last element of the list `lit` to the variable `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is the last element of `lit`.**
