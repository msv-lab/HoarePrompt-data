The code `x = a[-1]` attempts to assign the last element of list `a` to the variable `x`. Since `a` is either an empty list or not, this operation will only be valid if `a` is not empty. If `a` is empty, this would raise an `IndexError`. However, based on the given precondition, we will assume `a` is not empty for the purpose of this task.

Given that `a` is not empty, `x` will be assigned the value of the last element of `a`. The values of `b`, `cp`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are either empty lists or not, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is the last element of `a`**.
