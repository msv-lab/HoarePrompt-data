The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This affects the list `a` by adding a new element to it, but it does not change the other variables directly.

Given the initial state:
- `iterations` is 2
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string
- `cp` is 0
- `x` is greater than `y`
- If `a` is not empty, `x` is the last element of `a`; otherwise, `x` is positive infinity
- If `b` is an empty list, `y` is positive infinity; otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`
- `y` is less than `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`
- The current value of `lit[i]` satisfies `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`

After executing `a.append(lit[i])`:
- The list `a` will now include the element `lit[i]` at the end.
- If `a` was previously empty, `x` will now be equal to `lit[i]` because `x` is defined as the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element, `x` is `lit[i]` if `a` was previously empty, `y` is less than `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`.**
