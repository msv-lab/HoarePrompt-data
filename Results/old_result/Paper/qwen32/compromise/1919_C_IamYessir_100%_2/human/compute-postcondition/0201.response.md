Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are either empty lists or not, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`. If `y >= lit[i]`, `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element. Otherwise, if `lit[i] > x`, `b` has an additional element `lit[i]` and `y` is `lit[i]` if `b` was empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b` before the append operation. If `lit[i] <= x` and `lit[i] > y`, `a` has the element `lit[i]` appended to it, and `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `a` was empty before appending `lit[i]`, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`. If `lit[i] <= x` and `lit[i] <= y`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `x` and `y` retain their original values.**
