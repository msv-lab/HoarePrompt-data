Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are either empty lists or not, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`. If `x` is the last element of `a` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` is updated to include `lit[i]` as its last element; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged. `x` is the last element of `a`, and `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty; otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`.**
