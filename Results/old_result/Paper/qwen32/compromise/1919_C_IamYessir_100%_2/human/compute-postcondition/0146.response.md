Postcondition: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, `b` is either an empty list or contains all previous elements of `b` plus `lit[i]` if `y >= lit[i]`, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is positive infinity if `a` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`, and `y` is positive infinity if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b` after any potential append operation. If `y >= lit[i]`, `y` remains the same or is updated to `lit[i]` if `b` was empty and `lit[i]` is positive infinity. If `y < lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `a` and `x` remain unchanged. If `y < lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y` and less than or equal to `x`, `a` is updated to include `lit[i]` and `x` is set to `lit[i]`.**
