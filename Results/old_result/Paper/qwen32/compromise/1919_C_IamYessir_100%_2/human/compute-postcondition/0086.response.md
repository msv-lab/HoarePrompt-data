The code snippet appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. This means that the list `b` will now have an additional element, which is the element at index `i` of `lit`.

Given the initial conditions, let's update the state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `lit` remains a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `cp` remains 0.
- `i` remains `i + 2`.
- The value of `x` remains the same based on the conditions provided:
  - If the list `a` is empty, `x` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of the list `a`.
  - If the list `lit` is empty, `x` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `lit`.
- The value of `y` changes because `b` has a new element:
  - If the list `b` was empty before the append operation, `y` was `float('inf')`. After the append operation, `y` is the element that was just appended, which is `lit[i]`.
  - If the list `b` was not empty, `y` was the last element of `b` before the append operation. After the append operation, `y` is still the last element of `b`, which is `lit[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is `i + 2`, `x` is the last element of `lit` or `float('inf')` based on the conditions provided, `y` is `lit[i]`, `b` has a new element `lit[i]` appended to it.**
