Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is `i + 2`. If `x == y`, `a` has an additional element `lit[i]` appended to it. If `x < y`, then if `x >= lit[i]`, `a` has an additional element `lit[i]`, and `x` is updated to the last element of `lit` or `float('inf')` if `lit` is empty. If `x < lit[i]`, then if `lit[i] > y`, `a` has an additional element `lit[i]`, and `x` is updated to the last element of `lit` or `float('inf')` if `lit` is empty, with `y` remaining unchanged. If `lit[i] <= y`, then `x` is updated to the last element of `lit` or `float('inf')` if `lit` is empty. If `y >= lit[i] > x`, then `y` is updated to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is appended to the list `b`. If `x >= y`, no changes are made to `a`, `b`, `x`, or `y`.**
