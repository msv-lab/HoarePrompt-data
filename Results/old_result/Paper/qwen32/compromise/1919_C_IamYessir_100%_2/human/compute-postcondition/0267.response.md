The code snippet provided appends the `i`-th element of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This means the list `a` will now have one more element, which is `lit[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `iterations` is 2
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `lit` is a list of integers
- `cp` is 0
- `x` is equal to `y`
- If `a` is not empty, `x` is the last element of `a`; otherwise, `x` is positive infinity.
- If `b` is empty, `y` is positive infinity; otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`.
- Since `x` is equal to `y`, both `x` and `y` hold the same value.

After executing the code snippet, the list `a` will have an additional element, which is `lit[i]`. The values of `iterations`, `n`, `cp`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged unless `a` was previously empty, in which case `x` and `y` will now be equal to `lit[i]`.

Since the exact values of `lit[i]`, `a`, `x`, and `y` are not specified, we can only describe the changes to `a` and the implications for `x` and `y` if `a` was empty.

Output State: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element, `x` is equal to `y`, and if `a` was empty before, `x` and `y` are now `lit[i]`.**
