The code snippet `y = b[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `b` to the variable `y`. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `y`, which is now specifically set to the last element of the list `b`.

Output State: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is `float('inf')` if the length of `a` is 0, or the last element of list `a` otherwise, and `y` is the last element of list `b`.**
