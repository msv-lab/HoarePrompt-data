To determine the output of the `print(s)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the specific variable in question.

Initial State:
- `iterations` is set to 2.
- `n` is the length of the input list `lit`.
- `lit` is a list of integers converted from an input string.
- `cp` is initialized to 0.
- `a` is a list containing at least 5 elements.
- `b` is a list that contains elements from `lit` based on a loop's comparison logic.
- `s` is explicitly set to 8.

The `print(s)` statement will print the value of the variable `s`. According to the initial state, `s` is explicitly given the value 8. Therefore, the output will be this exact value.

Output: **8**
