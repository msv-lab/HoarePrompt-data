The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` adds the element `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Given the initial state, `a` could be either an empty list or not an empty list. After appending `lit[i]` to `a`, `a` will no longer be an empty list if it was initially empty, and it will have one more element if it was not empty.

The values of `b`, `cp`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged by this operation. The conditions involving `x`, `y`, and `lit[i]` continue to hold as they do not depend on the contents of `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a list containing its original elements plus `lit[i]`; `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `cp` is 0; `n` is greater than 0; `x` is positive infinity if `a` was initially an empty list, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is positive infinity if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`; `x` is greater than `y`, and `y` is less than `lit[i]` which is less than or equal to `x`. Additionally, `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`.**
