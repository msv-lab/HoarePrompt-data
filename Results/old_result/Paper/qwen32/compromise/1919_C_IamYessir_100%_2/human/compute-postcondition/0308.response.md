Output State: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is `float('inf')`, and `y` is `float('inf')` if the length of `b` is 0, or the last element of list `b` otherwise.**

In natural language: The value of `x` has been set to `float('inf')`. All other variables retain their initial values.
