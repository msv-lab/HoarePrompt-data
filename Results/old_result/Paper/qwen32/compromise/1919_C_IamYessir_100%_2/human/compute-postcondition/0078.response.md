The code snippet provided appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. Let's break down the impact of this code on the variables:

- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `lit` remains unchanged.
- `cp` remains unchanged.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `x` remains unchanged because it is determined by the last element of `lit` or `a` (whichever is non-empty).
- `y` remains unchanged because it is determined by the last element of `b` (before the new element is appended).
- `b` is updated to include the element `lit[i]` at the end of the list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is `i + 2`, `x` is `float('inf')` if `lit` is empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `lit`, `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b` before appending, `b` is the list `b` with `lit[i]` appended to it.**
