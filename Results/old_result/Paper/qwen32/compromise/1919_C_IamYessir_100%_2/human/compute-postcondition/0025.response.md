Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers from the input, `cp` is 0, `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` was an empty list before the append, or the last element of `a` before the append if `a` was not empty, `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is an empty list, otherwise it is the last element of `b`, `x` is greater than `y`, and `lit[i]` is such that `x >= lit[i] > y`. If `x >= lit[i] > y`, `a` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element.**
