The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `b`. This means that the list `b` will now include the element `lit[i]` as its last element. The values of `a`, `cp`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list with `lit[i]` as its last element, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is positive infinity if `a` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is positive infinity if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`, `y` is less than `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`.**
