Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are either empty lists or not. `cp` is 0. `n` is greater than 0. If `x > y`, then `a` and `x` remain unchanged unless `y < lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y` and less than or equal to `x`, in which case `a` includes `lit[i]` and `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `x <= y`, then if `x == y`, `a` is updated to include `lit[i]` and `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `x < y`, `x` and `y` retain their values unless `x >= lit[i]`, in which case `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element and `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `x < lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `lit[i]` is added to the end of `b`.**
