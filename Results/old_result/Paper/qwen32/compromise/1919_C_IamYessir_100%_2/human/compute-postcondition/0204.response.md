Output State: **`a` is the previous `a` with `lit[i]` appended to it, `b` is either empty or not, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is the last element of `a`, and `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`.**

In natural language: The list `a` now includes the element `lit[i]` appended to it. The other variables `b`, `cp`, `n`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged except for `x`, which is now the last element of the updated list `a`.
