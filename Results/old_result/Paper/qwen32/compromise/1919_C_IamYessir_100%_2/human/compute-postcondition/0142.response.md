Postcondition: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is positive infinity if `a` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is positive infinity if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`, `x` is greater than `y`, and `y` is less than `lit[i]` which is less than or equal to `x`. Additionally, `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`.**

In simpler terms: 
- `a` and `b` can be either empty or not empty.
- `cp` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `x` is positive infinity if `a` is empty, otherwise it is the last element of `a`.
- `y` is positive infinity if `b` is empty, otherwise it is the last element of `b`.
- `x` is greater than `y`.
- `y` is less than `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`.
- Inside the if condition, `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`.
