Output State: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is either `float('inf')` if the length of `a` is 0, or the last element of list `a` otherwise, `y` is `float('inf')`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been set to `float('inf')`. All other variables retain their initial values.
