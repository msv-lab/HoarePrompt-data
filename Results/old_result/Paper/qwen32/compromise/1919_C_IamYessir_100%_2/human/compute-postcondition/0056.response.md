The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This means the list `a` will have an additional element, which is the element at index `i` from `lit`. The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged unless `i` is out of bounds for `lit`, but based on the initial state provided, `i` is `i + 1` which suggests `i` is already incremented and within a valid range for `lit`.

Given the initial state, the output state would be:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is set to the last element of `lit` if `lit` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`, `y` is set to the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`, and `a` includes an additional element `lit[i]`.**
