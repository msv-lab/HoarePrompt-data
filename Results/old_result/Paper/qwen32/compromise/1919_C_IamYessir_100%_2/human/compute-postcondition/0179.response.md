The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This changes the state of `a` by adding a new element to it. The values of `b`, `cp`, `n`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` has a new element appended from `lit[i]`, `b` is either empty or not, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is set to `float('inf')` if `a` was empty before the operation; otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a` before the operation, `y` is set to `float('inf')` if `b` is empty; otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`.**
