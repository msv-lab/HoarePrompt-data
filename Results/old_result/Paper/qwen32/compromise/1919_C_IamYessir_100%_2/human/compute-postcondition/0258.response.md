Output State: **`iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `x` is greater than `y`. If `a` is not empty, `x` is the last element of `a`; otherwise, `x` is positive infinity. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is positive infinity; otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. Additionally, `lit[i]` is greater than `x` and `lit[i]` is now the last element of `b`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The list `b` now includes the element `lit[i]` as its last element. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
