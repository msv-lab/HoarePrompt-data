Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `iterations` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0. If `x > y`, then `lit[i]` is added to `a` if `x >= lit[i] > y` and `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `a` was previously empty. If `y >= lit[i]`, then `b` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element. If `lit[i] > x`, then `lit[i]` becomes the last element of `b`. If `lit[i] <= x`, then `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x` and `y` is less than `lit[i]`. If `x <= y`, then `a` includes `lit[i]` if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `x` and `y` are updated to `lit[i]` if `a` was empty before, `b` includes `lit[i]` and `y` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and greater than `x`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element. If `x` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is not greater than `y`, `b` and `y` remain unchanged. Additionally, `x` is less than or equal to `y` if the else part is executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is either `float('inf')` if the length of `a` is 0, or the last element of list `a` otherwise, and `y` is `float('inf')` if the length of `b` is 0, or the last element of list `b` otherwise. If `x` > `y`, then: if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[2]`, `b` has an additional element which is `lit[2]`. Otherwise, if `lit[2]` is greater than `x`, `b` includes the element `lit[2]` appended to it. If `lit[2]` is less than or equal to `x` and `lit[2]` is greater than `y`, `a` includes the element at index 2 of `lit`. If `x` <= `y`, then: if `x` equals `y`, `lit[2]` is appended to list `a`. If `x` is not equal to `y` and `x` is less than `y`, `lit[2]` is appended to list `a`. If `x` is not equal to `y` and `lit[2]` is greater than `y`, `lit[2]` is appended to list `a`. If `x` is not equal to `y`, `x` is less than `y`, `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[2]`, and `lit[2]` is greater than `x`, `lit[2]` is appended to list `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `iterations` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3. If `x > y`, then if `y >= lit[3]`, `b` includes `lit[3]` at the end. If `y < lit[3]`, `lit[3]` is appended to `b` if `lit[3] > x`, and to `a` if `x >= lit[3]` and `lit[3] > y`. If `x == y`, `lit[3]` is appended to `a`. If `x < y`, `lit[3]` is appended to `a` if `x >= lit[3]` or `x < lit[3]` and `lit[3] > y`. If `x < y` and `y >= lit[3]` and `lit[3] > x`, `lit[3]` is appended to `b`. If `x >= y`, no elements are appended to `a` or `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
