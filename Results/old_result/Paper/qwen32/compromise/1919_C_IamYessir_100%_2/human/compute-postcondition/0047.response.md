The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's call it `i_prev`), and `n` is greater than 0. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`. The value of `n` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`**.

Since we don't have the specific value of `i_prev`, we can generalize it as `i` being incremented by 1 from its previous value. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`**.
