In the provided for loop, the loop head only involves the variable `_` and the function `input()`. The loop will execute based on the integer value provided by `input()`, which is cast to an integer and used as the range for the loop.

Given the problem statement, `t` is the integer that represents the number of test cases, and it is provided as input. The loop will execute `t` times. Therefore, the state before the loop should include `t` being set to a value that ensures the loop will execute the correct number of times.

Since the loop head does not directly involve `n`, `a`, or any other variables from the problem statement, we only need to ensure that `t` is set correctly. The loop will execute `t` times if `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
