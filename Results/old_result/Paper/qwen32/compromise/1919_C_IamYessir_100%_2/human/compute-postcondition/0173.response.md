Output State: **`a` and `b` are either empty lists or not, `cp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is set to `float('inf')` if `a` is empty; otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`. If `b` is empty, `y` is set to `float('inf')`; otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. `b` now includes the element `lit[i]`.**

In natural language: The list `b` now contains an additional element, which is `lit[i]`. All other variables (`a`, `cp`, `n`, `i`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged in their conditions and values.
