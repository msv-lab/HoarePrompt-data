To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic and compare it with the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Splitting the array**: The goal is to split the array `a` into two subsequences `s` and `t` such that the sum of penalties `p(s) + p(t)` is minimized.
2. **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty `p(b)` of a subsequence `b` is the number of indices `i` where `b[i] < b[i+1]`.
3. **Optimal Splitting**: We need to find an optimal way to split the array to achieve the minimum penalty.

### Program Logic Analysis:
- The program initializes two empty lists `a` and `b` to hold the subsequences.
- It iterates over each element in the input array `lit`.
- For each element, it checks the last elements of `a` and `b` to decide which subsequence to add the current element to.
- The decision criteria seem to be based on comparing the current element with the last elements of `a` and `b`.
- After splitting, it calculates the penalties for both subsequences `a` and `b` and sums them up.

### Issues in the Program:
- The decision criteria for splitting the elements into subsequences `a` and `b` appear to be flawed. The program does not guarantee that the split will result in the minimum penalty.
- The logic `if x > y: ... elif x == y: ... elif x < y: ...` does not seem to follow any optimal strategy for minimizing the penalties.
- The program does not consider all possible ways to split the array and does not ensure that the split results in the minimum penalty.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy to minimize the penalty. The logic for splitting the array into subsequences `a` and `b` does not guarantee the minimum penalty.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not guarantee the optimal split that minimizes the total penalty. A correct approach would involve a more sophisticated algorithm, possibly dynamic programming or a greedy strategy, to find the optimal split.
