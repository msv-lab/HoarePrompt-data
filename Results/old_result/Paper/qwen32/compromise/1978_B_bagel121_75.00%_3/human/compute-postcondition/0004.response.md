Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. Specifically, it computes the maximum possible sum of `n` integers where each integer is either `a` or `b`, with the constraint that no more than `b - a + 1` of the integers can be `b`.**
