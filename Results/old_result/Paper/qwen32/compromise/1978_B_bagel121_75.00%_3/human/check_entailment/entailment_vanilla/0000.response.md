Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The problem involves selling `n` buns with a possible promotion where the first `k` buns can be sold at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `(b - k + 1)`, and the remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

The goal is to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by choosing an optimal `k`.

### Key Observations
1. If `a >= b`, it is always better to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the promotion price cannot be higher than the usual price.
2. If `a < b`, we need to find the optimal `k` to maximize profit. The profit from the first `k` buns is the sum of an arithmetic series starting from `b` down to `(b - k + 1)`, and the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns is `(n - k) * a`.

### Solution Analysis
The provided solution follows these steps:
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, read `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. If `a >= b`, print `n * a` because it's better to sell all buns at the usual price.
4. If `a < b`, calculate the optimal `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)`. This ensures we do not sell more buns at the promotional price than the number of buns available or the number of prices available.
5. Calculate the profit from the first `k` buns using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `ans = (b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`.
6. Calculate the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns: `p2 = (n - k) * a`.
7. Print the total profit `ans + p2`.

### Correctness
The solution correctly handles both cases (`a >= b` and `a < b`). It calculates the optimal `k` and computes the profit accordingly. The arithmetic series sum formula used is correct for the given problem constraints.

### Conclusion
The provided program is correct based on the problem description and the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
