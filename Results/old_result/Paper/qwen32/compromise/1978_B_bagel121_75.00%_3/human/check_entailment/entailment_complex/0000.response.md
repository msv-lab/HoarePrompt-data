### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each of these `t` test cases, it reads three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Logic for Maximum Profit Calculation:**
   - If `a >= b`, it means the usual price of a bun is greater than or equal to the modified price of the first bun. In this case, it's optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because selling them at the modified price would yield a lower profit.
   - If `a < b`, it means the usual price is less than the modified price. Here, the optimal strategy is to sell the first `k` buns at the modified price, where `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`. This ensures that we maximize the profit from the higher prices before switching to the usual price `a` for the remaining buns.
     - The profit from the first `k` buns is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k\).
     - The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns is simply `(n - k) * a`.
     - The total profit is the sum of these two values.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the calculated maximum profit.

4. **Edge Cases Considered:**
   - When `a >= b`, selling all buns at the usual price `a` is straightforward.
   - When `a < b`, the program correctly calculates the maximum profit by determining the optimal `k` and summing the profits from the two different price segments.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program processes each test case in constant time \(O(1)\), making it efficient even for the upper limit of \(t = 10^4\).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given promotion rules. It handles all edge cases and operates efficiently.

**Correctness: **True**
