Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the calculation of the maximum profit for all possible values of `k`. Specifically, the code calculates the maximum profit by fixing `k` to `min(b - a + 1, n)`, but this does not guarantee the optimal solution. The optimal `k` should be determined by comparing the total profit for different values of `k`.

Let's consider an example to illustrate this:

Input:
```
1
5 5 9
```

According to the problem statement, the optimal solution is to sell all buns at the modified price, which gives a profit of `9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35`.

However, the provided code calculates `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n) = min(9 - 5 + 1, 5) = 5`. This is correct in this specific case, but let's consider another example:

Input:
```
1
5 5 6
```

The optimal solution here is to sell the first 2 buns at the modified price and the remaining 3 buns at the usual price. This gives a profit of `6 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 26`.

However, the provided code calculates `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n) = min(6 - 5 + 1, 5) = 2`. This is correct in this specific case, but the code does not verify that this `k` is indeed optimal by comparing with other possible values of `k`.

To ensure the correctness, the code should iterate over all possible values of `k` from 0 to `n` and calculate the total profit for each `k`, then choose the maximum profit. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(n + 1):
            profit = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k) if k > 0 else 0
            profit += (n - k) * a
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected code ensures that the maximum profit is calculated by considering all possible values of `k`.
