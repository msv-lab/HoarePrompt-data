Output State: **The program returns the reversed list 'ans' which contains the cumulative products of the elements in 'b' in their original order.**

Explanation: Since `ans` already contains the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order, reversing `ans` will return the cumulative products in their original order.
