#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5 and 1 <= m <= 10^4. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^4. s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: `b` is a permutation of `a` based on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`; `l` is equal to `n` or more, and `r` is less than 0 or equal to -1, indicating that all elements of `a` have been processed.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: `b` is a permutation of `a` based on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`; `l` is equal to `n` or more, and `r` is less than 0 or equal to -1, indicating that all elements of `a` have been processed; `ans` is a list containing the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order; `p` is the product of all elements in `b`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the reversed list 'ans' which contains the cumulative products of the elements in 'b' in their original order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, an integer `m`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'. It constructs a new list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the direction specified by each character in `s`. It then calculates the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order and returns these products in their original order.
