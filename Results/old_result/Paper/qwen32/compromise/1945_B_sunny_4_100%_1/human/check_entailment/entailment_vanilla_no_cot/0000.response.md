Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic in the commented-out part of the code (`A=int(m/a)+1` and `B=int(m/b)+1`) is closer to the correct approach, but it still needs to account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations.

The current program simply adds 2 to the sum of `m // a` and `m // b`, which is incorrect. The correct approach involves finding the number of fireworks from each installation within the range `[0, m]` and then considering the overlap of fireworks from both installations.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        # Number of fireworks from the first installation
        A = (m + a - 1) // a
        # Number of fireworks from the second installation
        B = (m + b - 1) // b
        # Least Common Multiple of a and b
        from math import gcd
        lcm_ab = a * b // gcd(a, b)
        # Number of overlapping fireworks
        C = (m + lcm_ab - 1) // lcm_ab
        # Total maximum number of fireworks
        ans = A + B - C
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected program calculates the number of fireworks from each installation and subtracts the number of overlapping fireworks to get the correct answer.
