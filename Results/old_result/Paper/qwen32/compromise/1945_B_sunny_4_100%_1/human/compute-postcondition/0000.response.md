The code processes `t` test cases, each containing integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. For each test case, it calculates `A` as `int(m/a) + 1` and `B` as `int(m/b) + 1`, and then prints the sum `A + B`. The variables `a`, `b`, and `m` change with each iteration, but `t` remains constant.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each of the `t` test cases, the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are processed to compute and print `A + B`, where `A = int(m/a) + 1` and `B = int(m/b) + 1`.**
