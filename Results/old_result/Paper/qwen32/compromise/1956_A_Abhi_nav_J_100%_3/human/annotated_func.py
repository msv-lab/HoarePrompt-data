#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of k distinct integers where 1 <= k <= 100, and each element in a satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 100 with a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k. b is a list of q integers where 1 <= q <= 100, and each element in b satisfies 1 <= n_i <= 100.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a <= b) :
        return a - 1
        #The program returns a list where each element is 1 less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`.
    else :
        return b
        #The program returns list `b` which contains `q` integers where each integer satisfies 1 <= n_i <= 100.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, a list of `k` distinct integers sorted in ascending order where each integer is between 1 and 100, and `b`, a list of `q` integers where each integer is between 1 and 100. If `a` is lexicographically less than or equal to `b`, the function returns a new list where each element of `a` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, it returns the list `b`.
