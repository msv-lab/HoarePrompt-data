Postcondition: **`a` is a list of `k` distinct integers where 1 <= `k` <= 100, and each element in `a` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 100 with `a_1` < `a_2` < ... < `a_k`. `b` is a list of `q` integers where 1 <= `q` <= 100, and each element in `b` satisfies 1 <= `n_i` <= 100. The current value of `a` is less than or equal to `b`**
