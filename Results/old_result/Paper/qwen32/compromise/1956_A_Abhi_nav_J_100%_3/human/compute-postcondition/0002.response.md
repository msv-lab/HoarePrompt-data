Postcondition: **a is a list of k distinct integers where 1 <= k <= 100, and each element in a satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 100 with a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k. b is a list of q integers where 1 <= q <= 100, and each element in b satisfies 1 <= n_i <= 100. Additionally, a is not less than or equal to b, meaning there exists at least one index i such that a[i] > b[i] when comparing the lists lexicographically.**
