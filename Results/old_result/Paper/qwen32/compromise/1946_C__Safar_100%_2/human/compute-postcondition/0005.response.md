The code snippet `x, p = stack[-1]` unpacks the last element of the `stack` list into the variables `x` and `p`. Given the initial state, the last element of `stack` is `(1, 1)`, so `x` will be assigned the value `1` and `p` will also be assigned the value `1`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **A is a positive integer, g is an adjacency list representing the tree with n vertices, k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, stack is `[(1, 1)]`, visited is an empty set, d is `{1: 1}`, r is 0, x is 1, p is 1**.
