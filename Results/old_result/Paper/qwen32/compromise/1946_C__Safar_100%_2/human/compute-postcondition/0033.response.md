Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a tree, an integer `k` representing the number of edges to be removed (where 1 <= k < n), and a list of tuples `edges` where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b in the tree. The function returns the resulting structure or properties of the tree after removing `k` edges, ensuring the tree remains connected if possible.**
