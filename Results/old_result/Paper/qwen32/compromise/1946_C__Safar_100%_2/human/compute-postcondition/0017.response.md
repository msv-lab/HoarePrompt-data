Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree with `n` vertices such that `g[1]` contains at least one neighbor, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k < n`, `stack` is `[(1, 1), (node, x)]` if `node` is not equal to `p`, or `[(1, 1), (node, x)]` if `node` is equal to `p`, `visited` is `{1}`, `d` is `{1: 1}`, `r` is `0`, `x` is `1`, `p` is `1`, and `node` is the next element in `g[1]` after the current `node`.**

In simple terms, the `stack` now includes an additional tuple `(node, x)`. All other variables retain their initial values.
