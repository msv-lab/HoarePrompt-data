Output State: **A is a positive integer, g is an adjacency list representing the tree with n vertices, k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, stack is `[(1, 1)]`, visited is `{1}`, d is `{1: 1}`, r is 0, x is 1, p is 1, and x is in visited.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `x`, which is 1, has been added to the `visited` set. All other variables retain their initial values.
