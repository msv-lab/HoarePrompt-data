### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided code and verify its correctness against the problem requirements.

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and the string `s` representing the preferences of the residents.

2. **Middle Calculation:**
   - The variable `pk` is calculated as `n // 2`. This is used to find the middle point of the village.

3. **Counting Preferences:**
   - It counts the total number of '1's (`o`) and '0's (`z`) in the string `s`.

4. **Iterating Over Possible Road Positions:**
   - The program iterates over possible positions `i` where the road could be placed (from 0 to `n-1`).
   - For each position `i`, it calculates the number of '0's (`zero`) and '1's (`one`) to the left of the road.
   - It calculates the percentage of '0's and '1's that are satisfied on both sides of the road using `math.ceil`.
   - If both percentages are at least 50%, it adds the position `i + 1` to the list `lst`.

5. **Finding the Optimal Position:**
   - It finds the position in `lst` that is closest to `pk` (middle of the village).
   - If no valid position is found, it checks if placing the road before the first house or after the last house satisfies the condition and appends the appropriate value to `final`.

6. **Output:**
   - It prints the smallest position from `final`.

### Issues in the Code:

- **Percentage Calculation:**
  - The percentages are calculated incorrectly. Instead of calculating the actual number of satisfied residents, the code calculates a percentage which is unnecessary and incorrect for this problem.
  - Instead of `zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))` and `one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, it should directly compare the counts with their respective thresholds:
    ```python
    if zero >= math.ceil((i + 1) / 2) and (o - one) >= math.ceil((n - i - 1) / 2):
        lst.append(i + 1)
    ```

- **Edge Cases Handling:**
  - The code correctly handles the edge cases where the road can be placed before the first house or after the last house, but the logic needs to be simplified and corrected.

### Corrected Code:

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        
        pk = n // 2
        
        o = s.count('1')
        z = s.count('0')
        
        zero, one = 0, 0
        
        lst = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:
                one += 1
            if zero >= math.ceil((i + 1) / 2) and (o - one) >= math.ceil((n - i - 1) / 2):
                lst.append(i + 1)
        
        if not lst:
            if z >= math.ceil(n / 2):
                lst.append(0)
            elif o >= math.ceil(n / 2):
                lst.append(n)
        
        lst.sort(key=lambda x: (abs(pk - x), x))
        
        print(lst[0])

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original code has logical errors in how it calculates the satisfaction conditions and handles edge cases. After correcting these issues, the program should work as intended.

**Correctness: False** (due to the incorrect percentage calculation and logic)

However, after fixing the issues, the corrected version would be:

**Correctness: True**
