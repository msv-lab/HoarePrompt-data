The code appends the value of `n` to the list `final`. Since `final` was initially an empty list, after the operation, `final` will contain one element, which is `n`. The value of `c1` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the append operation.

Output State: **`final` is a list containing `[n]`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, and `c1` is less than 50**.
