To determine what will be printed, let's carefully analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4 (not directly relevant to the print statement).
- `n`: An integer with a value of 6.
- `a`: A string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'.
- `s`: The input string "010101".
- `pk`: Calculated as `n // 2`, which equals 3.
- `sl`: A list of characters from the string `s`, i.e., `['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1']`.
- `o`: The count of '1's in `sl`, which is 3.
- `z`: The count of '0's in `sl`, which is 3.
- `zero`: Set to 3.
- `one`: Set to 2.
- `lst`: A list containing `[2, 4]`.
- `mini`: Set to 1.
- `final`: The problem states that if the length of `final` is 0, it is updated to `[0]` if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise it is updated to `[6]`.

However, the variable `c1` is not defined in the initial state. Since the length of `final` is not mentioned to be 0, we cannot determine its initial value from the given information. But based on the conditional update rule, we can infer that `final` must have been initialized to either `[0]` or `[6]` depending on the value of `c1`.

Given the lack of information about `c1`, we cannot definitively say whether `final` was initialized to `[0]` or `[6]`. However, since the problem does not specify any other conditions or changes to `final` after this initialization, we can assume that `final` remains as it was initialized.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(final[0])
```

This statement will print the first element of the list `final`.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact value of `final` depends on the undefined variable `c1`, we can only describe the possible outputs based on the given conditions:
- If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is `[0]`, and `final[0]` is `0`.
- If `c1` is less than 50, `final` is `[6]`, and `final[0]` is `6`.

Without the specific value of `c1`, we cannot determine the exact printed value. However, based on the provided options, we can describe the possible outcomes.

Since the problem does not specify the value of `c1`, and assuming no other changes to `final` after initialization, the most precise description we can provide is:

Output: **either 0 or 6 (depending on the value of c1)**

However, if we need to choose one based on typical assumptions or if there's a common default, we might consider the more likely scenario where `c1` is less than 50 unless specified otherwise. Thus, the most probable output would be:

Output: **6**
