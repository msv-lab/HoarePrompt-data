Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, n is 6, a is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1', s is the input string "010101", pk is n // 2 which is 3, sl is a list of characters from the string s ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1'], o is the count of '1's in sl which is 3, z is the count of '0's in sl which is 3, zero is 3, one is 2, lst is [2, 4], mini is 1, final is []
Code of the loop:
for elem in lst:
    if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
        final.append(elem)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is 6, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string "010101", `pk` is `n // 2` which is 3, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s` ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is the count of '1's in `sl` which is 3, `z` is the count of '0's in `sl` which is 3, `zero` is 3, `one` is 2, `lst` is [2, 4], `mini` is 1. If `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, `final` is [2]. Otherwise, `final` remains [].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is 6, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string "010101", `pk` is `n // 2` which is 3, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s` ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is the count of '1's in `sl` which is 3, `z` is the count of '0's in `sl` which is 3, `zero` is 3, `one` is 2, `lst` is [2, 4], `mini` is 1, `elem` is 2. If `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, `final` is [2]. Otherwise, `final` remains [].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is 6, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string "010101", `pk` is `n // 2` which is 3, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s` ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is the count of '1's in `sl` which is 3, `z` is the count of '0's in `sl` which is 3, `zero` is 3, `one` is 2, `lst` is [2, 4], `mini` is 1, `elem` is 4. If `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, `final` is [4]. Otherwise, `final` remains [].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
