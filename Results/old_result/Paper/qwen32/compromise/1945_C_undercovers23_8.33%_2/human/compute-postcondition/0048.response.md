The given code updates the value of `mini` by comparing its current value with the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. Here, `pk` is 3 and `ele` is 4. The absolute difference between `pk` and `ele` is `abs(3 - 4)`, which equals 1. Since `mini` is initially 1, `mini` remains unchanged after the comparison.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is 6, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string "010101", `pk` is `n // 2` which is 3, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s` ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is the count of '1's in `sl` which is 3, `z` is the count of '0's in `sl` which is 3, `zero` is 3, `one` is 2, `lst` is [2, 4], `mini` is 1, `ele` is 4**.
