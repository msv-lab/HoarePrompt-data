The code snippet provided appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`. This means the list `lst` will now include an additional element which is the current value of `i + 1`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `lst`, as it gains a new element. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the user input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in `s`, `mini` is 100000000, `final` is [7] if `c1` is less than 50, or [0] if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `zero` is the count of '0's encountered so far, `one` is the count of '1's encountered so far, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of `zero * 100 / (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is the ceiling of `(o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)`, `lst` is updated to include `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
