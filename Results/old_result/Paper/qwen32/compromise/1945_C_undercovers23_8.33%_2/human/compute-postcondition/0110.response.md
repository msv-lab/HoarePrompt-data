Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is 7, `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string "010101", `pk` is 3, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s` ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is 4, `z` is 3, `mini` is 100000000, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / 6)`, `one_perc` is 400, `lst` is [6] if `zero_perc` ≥ 50 and `one_perc` ≥ 50, otherwise `lst` remains [], `i` is 5, and `zero` is `previous_value_of_zero` + 1 if `s[i]` is '0'.**
