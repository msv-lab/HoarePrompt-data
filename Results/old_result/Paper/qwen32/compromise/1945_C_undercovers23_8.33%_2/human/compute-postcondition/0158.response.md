Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the user input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in `s`, `mini` is 100000000, `lst` is [], `final` is [7] if `c1` is less than 50, or [0] if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50. If the current character `s[i]` is '0', then `zero` is 1 and `one` is 0. If the current character `s[i]` is '1', then `zero` is 0 and `one` is incremented by 1.**
