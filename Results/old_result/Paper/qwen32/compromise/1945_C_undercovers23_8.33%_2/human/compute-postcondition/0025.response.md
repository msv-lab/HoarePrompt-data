Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`, `lst` is either an empty list or contains the single element `i + 1` if `zero_perc` ≥ 50 and `one_perc` ≥ 50, `mini` is 100000000, `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `one` is 0 if `s[i]` is '0' and 1 otherwise, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` contains the single element `i + 1`; otherwise, `lst` remains an empty list.**
