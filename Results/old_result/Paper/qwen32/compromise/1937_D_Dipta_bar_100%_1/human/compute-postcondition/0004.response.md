To determine the output state after executing the given loop, let's analyze the code step by step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `A` is an initially empty list.
   - `idx_A` is an initially empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s` using the index `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - For each character `s[i]`:
     - If `s[i]` is '>', the code performs the following:
       - Checks if `idx_A` is empty.
         - If `idx_A` is empty, it appends `0` to `A`.
         - If `idx_A` is not empty, it calculates `x` as the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of the difference between the current index `i` and the last index stored in `idx_A` with the length of `idx_A`. It then appends `x` to `A`.
       - It appends the current index `i` to `idx_A`.

Let's break down the logic with an example string `s = "><><>>"`:

- **Iteration 0**: `s[0] = '>'`
  - `idx_A` is empty, so `A` becomes `[0]`.
  - `idx_A` becomes `[0]`.

- **Iteration 1**: `s[1] = '<'`
  - No changes to `A` or `idx_A` as the character is not '>'.

- **Iteration 2**: `s[2] = '>'`
  - `idx_A` is not empty, so `x = A[0] + (2 - 0) * 1 = 0 + 2 * 1 = 2`.
  - `A` becomes `[0, 2]`.
  - `idx_A` becomes `[0, 2]`.

- **Iteration 3**: `s[3] = '<'`
  - No changes to `A` or `idx_A`.

- **Iteration 4**: `s[4] = '>'`
  - `idx_A` is not empty, so `x = A[1] + (4 - 2) * 2 = 2 + 2 * 2 = 6`.
  - `A` becomes `[0, 2, 6]`.
  - `idx_A` becomes `[0, 2, 4]`.

- **Iteration 5**: `s[5] = '>'`
  - `idx_A` is not empty, so `x = A[2] + (5 - 4) * 3 = 6 + 1 * 3 = 9`.
  - `A` becomes `[0, 2, 6, 9]`.
  - `idx_A` becomes `[0, 2, 4, 5]`.

- **Iteration 6**: `s[6] = '>'`
  - `idx_A` is not empty, so `x = A[3] + (6 - 5) * 4 = 9 + 1 * 4 = 13`.
  - `A` becomes `[0, 2, 6, 9, 13]`.
  - `idx_A` becomes `[0, 2, 4, 5, 6]`.

After the loop completes, the final values of `A` and `idx_A` are `[0, 2, 6, 9, 13]` and `[0, 2, 4, 5, 6]`, respectively.

Output State: **`A` is `[0, 2, 6, 9, 13]` and `idx_A` is `[0, 2, 4, 5, 6]`.**
