The code snippet initializes a new empty list `idx_A`. The variables `s` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is the length of `s`; `A` is an empty list; `idx_A` is an empty list.**
