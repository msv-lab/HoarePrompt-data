### Reasoning:

The provided program is supposed to calculate the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position in the grid. The program uses a complex algorithm to achieve this, involving two main lists, `A` and `B`, which track the cumulative movements of the pinballs as they encounter '>' and '<' characters, respectively.

Here is a breakdown of the logic in the program:

1. **Initialization and Parsing Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the grid string `s`.

2. **Processing '>' Characters:**
   - The program iterates through the string `s` to process '>' characters.
   - For each '>' character, it calculates the cumulative movement of the pinball based on the positions of previously encountered '>' characters and stores this information in list `A`.

3. **Processing '<' Characters:**
   - The program iterates through the string `s` in reverse to process '<' characters.
   - For each '<' character, it calculates the cumulative movement of the pinball based on the positions of previously encountered '<' characters and stores this information in list `B`.

4. **Calculating Results:**
   - The program then uses the information in `A` and `B` to calculate the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.
   - It uses a two-pointer technique to combine the information from `A` and `B` to determine the correct result for each position.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated results for each starting position in the grid.

The program's logic appears to be correctly implemented based on the problem description and the provided example. The execution summary indicates that the function `func_1` processes the string `s` and prints the expected output for each test case.

### Correctness:

Given the complexity of the problem and the provided solution, the program appears to correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. The example provided in the problem statement is correctly handled by the program, which suggests that the program is likely correct.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
