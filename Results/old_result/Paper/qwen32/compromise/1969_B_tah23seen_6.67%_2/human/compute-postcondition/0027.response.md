To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop head:

```
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will continue to execute as long as two conditions are met:
1. `left < len(s)`
2. `s[left] != '1'`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5.
- `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` and `s[0]` is '0'; `s[1]` is '0'; `s[2]` is '1'; `s[3]` is '1'.
- `left` is 2.
- `right` is len(s).

Let's analyze the current state:
- `left` is 2, and `s[left]` is `s[2]`, which is '1'. This means the condition `s[left] != '1'` is not satisfied, and the loop would not execute again based on the current state.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the state such that both conditions are satisfied:
1. `left` should be less than `len(s)`.
2. `s[left]` should not be '1'.

Since `left` is currently 2 and `s[2]` is '1', we need to change either `left` or `s[left]` to satisfy the conditions. However, since we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head (`left` and `s[left]`), the most straightforward adjustment is to decrement `left` to a position where `s[left]` is '0'.

Let's set `left` to 1 (since `s[1]` is '0'):

State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5; `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` and `s[0]` is '0'; `s[1]` is '0'; `s[2]` is '1'; `s[3]` is '1'; `left` is 1; `right` is len(s)**
