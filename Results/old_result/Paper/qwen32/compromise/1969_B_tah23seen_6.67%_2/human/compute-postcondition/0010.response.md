The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `right`. The other variables (`sChar`, `s`, `left`, and `cost`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5; `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar`; `left` is 0; `cost` is 0; `right` is 1.**
