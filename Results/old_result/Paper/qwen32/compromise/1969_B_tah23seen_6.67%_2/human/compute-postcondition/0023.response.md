To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head:

```
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will execute if both conditions are true:
1. `left < len(s)`
2. `s[left] != '1'`

Given the state right before the loop:
- `sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5.
- `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar`.
- `left` is 0.
- `right` is len(s).
- `s[1]` is '1'.
- `s[2]` is '1'.
- `s[3]` is '1'.
- If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', then `cost` is 2; otherwise, `cost` remains 0.

From this information, we know:
- `left` is initialized to 0.
- `s` is a list of characters ('0' and '1') with at least 4 elements (since `s[1]`, `s[2]`, and `s[3]` are defined).

For the loop to execute, `s[left]` (which is `s[0]` since `left` is 0) must not be '1'. Given that `s[1]`, `s[2]`, and `s[3]` are all '1', we can infer that `s[0]` could be either '0' or '1'. To ensure the loop executes, we need to set `s[0]` to '0'.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted such that `s[0]` is '0'.

State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5; `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` and `s[0]` is '0'; `left` is 0; `right` is len(s); `s[1]` is '1'; `s[2]` is '1'; `s[3]` is '1'; if `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', then `cost` is 2; otherwise, `cost` remains 0.**
