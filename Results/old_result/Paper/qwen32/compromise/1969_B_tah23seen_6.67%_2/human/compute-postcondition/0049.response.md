The code swaps the elements at indices `left` and `right` in the list `s`. Given the initial state, `s[left]` (which is `s[3]`) is '1', and `s[right]` (which is `s[len(s) - 1]`) is also '1'. After the swap, both `s[left]` and `s[right]` remain '1'. No other elements in the list `s` are affected.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` and `s[0]` is '0'; `s[1]` is '0'; `s[2]` is '0'; `s[3]` is '1'; `s[len(s) - 1]` is '1'; `left` is 3; `right` is `len(s) - 1`.**
