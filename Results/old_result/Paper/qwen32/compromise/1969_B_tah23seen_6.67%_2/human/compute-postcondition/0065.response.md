To determine the final state of the loop, let's analyze the given code snippet and the provided outputs after the first three iterations.

### Code Analysis
The loop is defined as follows:
```python
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
    left += 1
```
- **Condition**: The loop continues as long as `left` is less than the length of `s` and the character at index `left` in `s` is not '1'.
- **Body**: Inside the loop, `left` is incremented by 1.

### Initial State
- `s` is a list of characters where `s[0]`, `s[1]`, and `s[2]` are '0', and `s[3]` is '1'. The last element of `s` is also '1'.
- `left` is initialized to 3.
- `right` is initialized to the length of `s`.

### Iteration Details
- **First Iteration**: 
  - Before the loop starts, `left` is 3 and `s[left]` is '1'.
  - Since `s[left]` is '1', the condition `s[left] != '1'` is false, so the loop does not execute.
  - Therefore, `left` remains 3.
  
- **Second Iteration**:
  - The loop does not execute because the condition was not met in the first iteration.
  - `left` remains 3.
  
- **Third Iteration**:
  - The loop still does not execute because the condition was not met in the first iteration.
  - `left` remains 3.

### Conclusion
Since the condition `s[left] != '1'` is false right from the start (as `s[3]` is '1'), the loop does not execute even once. Therefore, the value of `left` remains 3 throughout all iterations.

### Final Output State
- `sChar` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `s` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `left` remains 3.
- `right` remains the length of `s`.

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` and `s[0]` is '0'; `s[1]` is '0'; `s[2]` is '0'; `s[3]` is '1'; `s[len(s) - 1]` is '1'; `left` is 3; `right` is `len(s)`**

In simple terms, the final state is the same as the initial state because the loop does not modify any variables and does not execute due to the initial condition being false.
