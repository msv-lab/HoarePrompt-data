To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze how the loop behaves given the provided initial and intermediate states.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop condition is `while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':`
- The loop increments `left` by 1 in each iteration as long as `s[left]` is '0'.

### Initial State:
- `sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters.
- `s` is a list containing all the elements from `sChar`.
- `left` is initialized to 0.
- `right` is initialized to `len(s)`.
- `s[1]`, `s[2]`, and `s[3]` are '1'.
- `cost` is 2 if `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', otherwise it remains 0.

### Intermediate States:
- After 1st iteration: `s[0]` is '0', `left` becomes 1.
- After 2nd iteration: `s[1]` is '0', `left` becomes 2.
- After 3rd iteration: `s[2]` is '1', so `left` remains 2 (no further increment).

### Conclusion:
The loop will stop when `s[left]` becomes '1'. Given the intermediate states, we can infer that the first three characters of `s` are '0', '0', '1'. Therefore, `left` will be 2 after the third iteration, and since `s[2]` is '1', the loop will terminate.

### Final Output State:
- `sChar` remains the same list of strings.
- `s` remains the same list derived from `sChar`.
- `left` is 2.
- `right` remains `len(s)`.
- `s[1]` is '0'.
- `s[2]` is '1'.
- `s[3]` is '1'.
- `cost` remains unchanged unless `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', which is not the case here.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5; `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` and `s[0]` is '0'; `s[1]` is '0'; `s[2]` is '1'; `s[3]` is '1'; `left` is 2; `right` is len(s).**
