Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the allowed cyclic shifts. Here are some reasons why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Swapping and Cost Calculation**: The program attempts to swap '0' and '1' when it finds a '1' on the left and a '0' on the right, but this approach does not guarantee the minimum cost. It also calculates the cost incorrectly by adding `right - left + 1` for every swap, which does not reflect the actual minimal operations required.

2. **Lack of Proper Handling of Substrings**: The program does not handle the cyclic nature of the operation properly. It does not consider that multiple swaps might be needed to bring all '0's to the front or all '1's to the end, and it does not account for the optimal way to perform these swaps with minimal cost.

3. **Inefficient Search for '0' and '1'**: The nested while loops for finding the next '0' and '1' are inefficient and do not ensure that the minimal cost is calculated.

A correct approach would involve counting the number of '1's that appear before the first '0' and calculating the cost based on the number of swaps needed to move all '1's to the end of the string. This can be done in linear time per test case.

Here is an example of a correct implementation:

```python
def min_cost_to_sort(s):
    cost = 0
    count_ones = 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '1':
            count_ones += 1
        elif char == '0' and count_ones > 0:
            cost += count_ones
    return cost

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    s = input()
    print(min_cost_to_sort(s))
```

This implementation correctly calculates the minimum cost by keeping track of the number of '1's encountered and adding the count to the cost whenever a '0' is encountered after some '1's.
