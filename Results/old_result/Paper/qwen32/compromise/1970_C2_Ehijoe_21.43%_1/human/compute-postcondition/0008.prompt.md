Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key is a node (integer) and each value is a list of integers representing the neighboring nodes; `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game; `moves` is a list of integers representing the number of moves required to reach each node from the starting node; `n` is the first integer from the input; `t` is the second integer from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `leaves` is an empty deque.
Code of the loop:
for key in nodes:
    if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
        leaves.append(key)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
