To determine the correctness of the given program, let's break down the problem and the solution step by step.

### Problem Breakdown
- **Objective**: Determine the winner of the game based on the starting node of the stone. The game is played on a tree, and players alternate moves until no valid moves are left.
- **Rules**:
  - Ron makes the first move.
  - Players alternate moves.
  - A move consists of moving the stone to an inactive neighbor.
  - The player who cannot make a move loses.
- **Input**:
  - Number of nodes \( n \) and number of rounds \( t \) (where \( t = 1 \)).
  - The tree edges.
  - The starting node for the stone.
- **Output**:
  - "Ron" if Ron wins, "Hermione" if Hermione wins.

### Solution Explanation
1. **Graph Representation**:
   - The tree is represented using an adjacency list (`nodes`), where each node points to its neighbors.
2. **Leaf Nodes**:
   - Leaf nodes (nodes with only one connection) are identified and stored in a deque (`leaves`).
3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the distances from the starting node to all other nodes in the tree, excluding the path to the parent node.
   - It recursively calculates the distances and returns a list of distances.
4. **Winning Condition**:
   - If there is at least one node at an odd distance from the starting node, Ron wins because he can force Hermione into a losing position.
   - If all distances are even, Hermione wins because Ron will eventually be forced into a losing position.

### Analysis of the Program
- The program correctly builds the adjacency list for the tree.
- It calculates the distances from the starting node to all other nodes using a recursive function.
- The winning condition is correctly checked by verifying if there is any odd distance in the list of distances.

### Example Verification
Let's verify the example provided:
- **Input**:
  ```
  5 1
  1 2
  1 3
  3 4
  3 5
  1
  ```
- **Output**: "Ron"

For the given tree and starting node 1:
- Distances from node 1: [0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
- Since there are distances with odd values (1), Ron wins.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the starting node and the tree structure. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
