### Reasoning:

The provided program's logic seems flawed based on the problem description. The task is to divide numbers into groups such that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit (from 1st to 31st bit) in their binary representation. The given function `func_1` does not correctly implement this logic.

Here's a breakdown of why the logic is incorrect:

1. **Bitwise Complement and Counting**:
   - The function `func_1` uses `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to find the bitwise complement of a number. However, this operation is not directly useful for determining if two numbers can be in the same group based on the problem's requirements.
   - The dictionary `count` is used to track the net count of each number and its bitwise complement. This does not help in determining if two numbers can be in the same group based on their bit patterns.

2. **Group Formation**:
   - The problem requires forming groups where no two numbers share the same bit in the range 1 to 31. This can be solved by using a bitmasking approach or by using a set to track the bit patterns that have been used in each group. The current implementation does not ensure that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit.

3. **Flawed Logic in `res` Calculation**:
   - The variable `res` is incremented whenever a number is not in the `count` dictionary. This does not correctly determine the minimum number of groups required. Instead, it counts the number of unique bit patterns encountered, which is not the same as determining the minimum number of groups.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, one approach is to use a bitmask to track the bit patterns used in each group. The minimum number of groups required will be equal to the maximum number of overlapping bit patterns at any point. This can be done using a bitmask and a set to track the bit patterns.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
