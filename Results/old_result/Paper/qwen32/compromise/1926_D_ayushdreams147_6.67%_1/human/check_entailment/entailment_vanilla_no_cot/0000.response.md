Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The approach taken in the function `func_1` is not appropriate for determining the minimum number of groups required. The idea of using the XOR operation with `(1 << 31) - 1` (which is a bitmask with the first 31 bits set to 1) and the logic to count occurrences does not align with the problem's requirement of ensuring that no two numbers in the same group have matching bit values in the 1st to 31st bit positions.

A correct approach would involve checking the bit patterns of the numbers and grouping them such that no two numbers in the same group have the same bit in any position from 1 to 31. This can be achieved by using a bitmask or a set to track the bit patterns that have already been used in a group. The minimum number of groups needed will be equal to the maximum number of overlapping bit patterns.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(a))

def func_1(a):
    used_patterns = set()
    for num in a:
        pattern = tuple((num >> i) & 1 for i in range(31))
        if pattern in used_patterns:
            continue
        else:
            used_patterns.add(pattern)
    return len(used_patterns)
```

This program creates a tuple representing the bit pattern of each number for the first 31 bits and adds it to a set if it hasn't been used before. The size of the set at the end of the process will be the minimum number of groups required.
