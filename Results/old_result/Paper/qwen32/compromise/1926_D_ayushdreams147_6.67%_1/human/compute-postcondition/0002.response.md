The only variable in the loop head is `num`, which iterates over the elements of the list `a`. The loop will execute if `a` has at least one element. Given that `n` is the length of the list `a` and it is provided that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`, the loop will definitely execute because `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n` or the elements of `a` to ensure the loop executes.

However, we need to specify the initial state of `num` as it would be during the first iteration of the loop. Since `num` will take the value of the first element of `a` during the first iteration, we can denote this as `a[0]`.

The states `res` and `count` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. They are initialized to 0 and an empty dictionary, respectively, which is already provided.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, `res` is 0, `count` is an empty dictionary, `num` is `a[0]`**
