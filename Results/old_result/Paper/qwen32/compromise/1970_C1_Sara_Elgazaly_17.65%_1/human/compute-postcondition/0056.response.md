The code snippet `y = lst[x].pop()` removes the last element from the list stored in `lst[x]` and assigns it to `y`. This means the list stored in `lst[x]` will have one less element after the operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains `t` integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where `lst[x]` has one less element, `x` is the last node that was fully explored, `y` is the last element that was popped from `lst[x]`, and `s` is True.**

In natural language: The value of `y` is now the last element that was popped from the list `lst[x]`, and the list `lst[x]` has one less element than it did before the operation. All other variables retain their previous values.
