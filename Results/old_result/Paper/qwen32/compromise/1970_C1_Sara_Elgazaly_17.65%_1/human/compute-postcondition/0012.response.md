The code snippet `lst[a].append(b)` modifies the defaultdict `lst` by appending the value `b` to the list associated with the key `a`. Given the initial state, `lst[a]` already includes `b` twice, so after appending `b` once more, `lst[a]` will include `b` three times. The list associated with the key `b` in `lst` remains unchanged, still including `a` three times.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5; `t` is 1; the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves; the last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round; `x` is 2; `y` are the two integers read from the input; `a` and `b` are the two new integers read from the input; `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where `lst[a]` includes `b` three times and `lst[b]` includes `a` three times.**
