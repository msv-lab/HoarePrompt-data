The given code snippet is:

```
s = True
```

This line of code simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `s`. None of the other variables (`n`, `t`, `x`, `y`, `lst`) are affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` is 2, `y` are the two integers read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where for every pair (a, b) read during the iterations, `lst[a]` contains `b` exactly `x - 1` times and `lst[b]` contains `a` exactly `x - 1` times, `s` is True.**
