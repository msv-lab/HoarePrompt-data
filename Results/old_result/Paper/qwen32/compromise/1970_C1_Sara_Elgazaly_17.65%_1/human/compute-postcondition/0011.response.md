The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This means the values of `a` and `b` will be updated based on the input.

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5; `t` is 1; the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves; the last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round; `x` is 2; `y` are the two integers read from the input; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input; `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where `lst[a]` includes `b` twice and `lst[b]` includes `a` three times.

After the code snippet `a, b = map(int, input().split())` is executed, the values of `a` and `b` will be updated to the new integers read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5; `t` is 1; the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves; the last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round; `x` is 2; `y` are the two integers read from the input; `a` and `b` are the two new integers read from the input; `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where `lst[a]` includes `b` twice and `lst[b]` includes `a` three times.**

In simpler terms: The values of `a` and `b` have been updated to the two integers read from the input, while all other variables retain their initial values.
