Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains `t` integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `lst[2]` contains at least one element (now with one less element than before), `x` is the integer that was popped from `lst[y]`, `y` is the integer that was popped from `lst[x]`, and `s` is True. `lst[x]` has one less element than before, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms: The values of `n`, `t`, the tree structure, the starting node, and the list `lst` remain the same except that `lst[2]` now has one less element than before, and `lst[x]` also has one less element than before. The variable `x` holds the value that was popped from `lst[y]`, and `y` holds the value that was popped from `lst[x]`. The variable `s` is still True. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
