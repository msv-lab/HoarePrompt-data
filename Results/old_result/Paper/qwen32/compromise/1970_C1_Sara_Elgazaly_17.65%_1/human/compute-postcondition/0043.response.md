The code snippet `y = lst[x].pop()` removes and returns the last element from the list associated with the key `x` in the `defaultdict` `lst`. Given that `x` is equal to `y` and `y` is the last element that was popped from `lst[x]`, after executing this code, `y` will take the value of the new last element that was popped from `lst[x]`. The list `lst[x]` will have one less element than before.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains `t` integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where `lst[x]` has one less element than before, `x` is equal to `y`, `y` is the element that was just popped from `lst[x]`, and `s` is False.**
