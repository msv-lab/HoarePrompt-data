The code snippet `y = lst[x].pop()` modifies the list stored in `lst[x]` by removing the last element and assigns this element to `y`. Given that `x` is equal to `y` before this operation, the value of `y` will change to the last element of `lst[x]`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `lst[x]` loses its last element.
- `y` takes the value of the last element that was in `lst[x]`.

Since `x` is equal to `y` before the `pop` operation, the new value of `y` is the last element of `lst[y]` before the operation. Therefore, `x` remains equal to `y` after the operation, but the list `lst[x]` is now shorter by one element.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains `t` integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where `lst[x]` has at least one element, `x` is equal to `y`, `y` is the last element that was popped from `lst[x]`, and `s` is True.**

After the execution of the code, `lst[x]` has one less element, and `y` is now the last element that was popped from `lst[x]`. The value of `x` remains the same, and `s` remains True.
