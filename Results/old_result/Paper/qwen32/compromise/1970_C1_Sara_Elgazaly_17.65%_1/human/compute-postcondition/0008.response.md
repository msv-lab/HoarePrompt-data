The code snippet `lst[a].append(b)` modifies the list associated with the key `a` in the defaultdict `lst` by appending the value `b` to it. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Given the initial state, `lst[a]` initially contains `b`, and after the code execution, `lst[a]` will contain `b` twice (since `b` is appended to the existing list which already contains `b`).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` is 2, `y` are the two integers read from the input, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where `lst[a]` includes `b` twice and `lst[b]` includes `a`.**
