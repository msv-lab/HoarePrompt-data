To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State Analysis

1. **Variables with Explicit Values:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n`: An integer greater than 1.
   - `p`: A permutation of the set \(\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\).
   - `g`: Initialized to 0.
   - `kp`: Initialized to 1.
   - `prev`: Initialized to 0.
   - `r`: An input string.
   - `i`: The new input integer + 1.
   - `v2`: The new input integer `i`.

2. **Variables Defined by Conditions:**
   - `v1`: The new input integer `i` if `r` equals `<`, otherwise `v1` remains 0.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

- The variable `v1` is determined based on the value of `r`. If `r` is `'<'`, then `v1` is set to the new input integer `i`. Otherwise, `v1` remains 0.
- `v2` is explicitly set to the new input integer `i`.
- The print statement formats the output as `f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}'`.

### Determining the Output

Given the format of the print statement, we need to consider the two possible cases for `v1`:

1. **Case 1:** If `r` is `'<'`
   - `v1` is set to the new input integer `i`.
   - The output will be `f'? {i} {i} {i} {i}'`.

2. **Case 2:** If `r` is not `'<'`
   - `v1` remains 0.
   - The output will be `f'? 0 0 {i} {i}'`.

Since the exact value of `r` and the new input integer `i` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `v1` and `v2`. However, we can describe the output based on the conditions given.

### Final Output Description

The print statement will output a formatted string where `v1` and `v2` are determined based on the input conditions described above.

Output: **? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2] (where v1 is the new input integer i if r equals '<', otherwise v1 is 0, and v2 is the new input integer i)**
