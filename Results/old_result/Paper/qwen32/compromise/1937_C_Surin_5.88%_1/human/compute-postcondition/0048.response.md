Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index i for which `r` == '<' was observed during the loop iterations, `r` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 1` where `i + 1` is less than `n`. If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to `i`.**
