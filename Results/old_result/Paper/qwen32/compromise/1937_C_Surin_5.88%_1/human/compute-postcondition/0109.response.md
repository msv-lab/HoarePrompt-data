Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This variable does not affect the print statement directly.
2. **`n`**: Must be greater than 1. This is the length of the permutation `p`.
3. **`p`**: A permutation of \(\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\).
4. **`I`**: A lambda function (not used in the print statement).
5. **`R`**: A lambda function (not used in the print statement).
6. **`g`**: Initialized to 0 (not used in the print statement).
7. **`v1`**: Initialized to 0.
8. **`prev`**: The largest index `i` for which the response `r` was `>` during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` was found (not used in the print statement).
9. **`i`**: Initialized to \(n-1\) (not used in the print statement).
10. **`kp`**: Initialized to 2 (not used in the print statement).
11. **`v2`**: Initialized to \(n-1\).

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Variable Values:
- **`v1`**: Explicitly initialized to 0.
- **`v2`**: Explicitly initialized to \(n-1\).

### Output Calculation:
Given the explicit values of `v1` and `v2`, the print statement will substitute these values into the formatted string.

Thus, the output will be:
```
? 0 0 (n-1) (n-1)
```

However, since `n` is not explicitly given but must be greater than 1, we can represent the output in terms of `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **? 0 0 n-1 n-1**
