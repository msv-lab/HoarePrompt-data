The given code snippet only modifies the value of the variable `prev`. It assigns the current value of `i` to `prev`. 

Given the initial state, `i` is 2. Therefore, `prev` will now hold the value 2.

All other variables retain their initial values as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}, `I` is a lambda function, `R` is a lambda function, `g` is 0, `prev` is 2, `i` is 2, `kp` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, and `v1` is the highest index `i` for which the response `r` was `'<'` or `0` if no such `i` was found; `r` is the new input received from the user.**
