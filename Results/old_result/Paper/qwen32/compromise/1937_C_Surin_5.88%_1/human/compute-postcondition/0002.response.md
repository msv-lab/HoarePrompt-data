To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for kp in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The key variable here is `kp`, which iterates over the range defined by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be a positive integer.

Let's break down the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. This means that the input must be a valid integer string that represents the number of iterations.

2. **Range Function**: The `range` function requires a non-negative integer. If the input is less than 1, the loop will not execute.

Given the state before the loop starts includes `t`, `n`, `p`, `I`, and `R`, none of these directly influence the loop's execution condition except through potential indirect effects via input functions `I` and `R`.

However, since the loop's execution directly depends on the input provided to `int(input())`, we need to ensure that this input is a positive integer.

### Adjusted State

Since the loop's execution is determined by the input to `int(input())`, we need to ensure that this input is a positive integer. We don't have direct control over the input function, but we can specify the state such that the input is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, and the input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer**

However, to simplify and directly address the loop's execution condition, we can state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, and the input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once. 

Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, and the input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1**
