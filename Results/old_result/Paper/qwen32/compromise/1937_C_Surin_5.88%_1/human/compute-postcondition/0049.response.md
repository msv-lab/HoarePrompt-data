To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables change with each iteration.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³ (remains unchanged).
   - `n`: An integer greater than 1 (remains unchanged).
   - `p`: A permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1} (remains unchanged).
   - `I`: A lambda function for reading and splitting input (remains unchanged).
   - `R`: A lambda function for reading integer input (remains unchanged).
   - `g`: 0 (remains unchanged).
   - `v1`: The largest index `i` for which `r == '<'` was observed during the loop iterations (initially 0, but can change based on loop execution).
   - `prev`: 0 (initially 0, but can change based on loop execution).

2. **Loop Iteration:**
   - For `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive), the following happens:
     - Print a query: `? v1 i v1 prev`
     - Read the response `r`.
     - If `r == '>'`, update `prev` to `i`.

### Final Output State:
- The loop runs `n-1` times, iterating over `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
- After all iterations, `i` will be `n`.
- `v1` remains the largest index for which `r == '<'` was observed during the loop iterations.
- `prev` will be the last index `i` for which `r == '>'` was observed, or it will remain 0 if no such `i` was found.

### Conclusion:
After the loop completes all its iterations, the state of the variables will be as follows:
- `t`, `n`, `p`, `I`, `R`, and `g` remain unchanged.
- `v1` is the largest index `i` where `r == '<'` was observed.
- `prev` is the last index `i` where `r == '>'` was observed, or 0 if no such `i` was found.
- `i` will be `n` after the loop ends.

### Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index i for which r == '<' was observed during the loop iterations, `prev` is the last index i for which r == '>' was observed, or 0 if no such i was found, and `i` is n.**

In simpler terms, the loop finishes with `i` equal to `n`, `v1` holding the largest index where `<` was observed, and `prev` holding the last index where `>` was observed, or 0 if no `>` was observed. All other variables remain as they were initially.
