The given code snippet defines a new lambda function `R` that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns this integer. This does not affect the existing variables `t`, `n`, or `p`. It only introduces a new function `R`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer.**
