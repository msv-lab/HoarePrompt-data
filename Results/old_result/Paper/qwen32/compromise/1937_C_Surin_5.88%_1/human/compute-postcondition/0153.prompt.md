Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer.
Code of the loop:
for kp in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    g = 0
    v1 = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        v2 = i
        print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r = input('')
        if r == '<':
            v1 = v2
    prev = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r = input()
        if r == '>':
            prev = i
    print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
    sys.stdout.flush()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index i for which r == '<' was observed during the loop iterations, `prev` is the last index i for which r == '>' was observed, or 0 if no such i was found, and `i` is n.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}, `I` is a lambda function, `R` is a lambda function, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index `i` for which the response `r` was `<` during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` was found, `prev` is the largest index `i` for which the response `r` was `>` during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` was found, `i` is `n-1`, `kp` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function, `R` is a lambda function, `g` is 0, `prev` is the highest index i for which the response r was '>', `i` is n-1, `kp` is 2, `v2` is n-1, and `v1` is the highest index i for which the response r was '<' or 0 if no such i was found.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
