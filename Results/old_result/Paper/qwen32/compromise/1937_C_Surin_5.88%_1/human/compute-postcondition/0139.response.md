To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³. This variable is not used in the print statement.
- `n` is greater than 1. This variable is also not directly used in the print statement.
- `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}. This variable is not used in the print statement.
- `I` and `R` are lambda functions. These functions are not used in the print statement.
- `g` is 0. This variable is not used in the print statement.
- `prev` is 1 if `r` equals `'>'` otherwise `prev` remains 0. The value of `prev` depends on the input `r`.
- `i` is 2. This variable is used in the print statement.
- `kp` is 2. This variable is not used in the print statement.
- `v2` is `n-1`. This variable is not used in the print statement.
- `v1` is the highest index `i` for which the response `r` was `'<'` or `0` if no such `i` was found. The value of `v1` depends on the input `r`.
- `r` is the input received from the user. This variable determines the value of `prev` and `v1`.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

We need to determine the values of `v1`, `i`, and `prev`:
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `prev` is 1 if `r` equals `'>'` otherwise it is 0.
- `v1` is the highest index `i` for which the response `r` was `'<'` or `0` if no such `i` was found.

Since the exact value of `r` is not provided, we can only describe `prev` and `v1` in terms of `r`:
- If `r` is `'>'`, then `prev` is 1.
- If `r` is not `'>'`, then `prev` is 0.
- `v1` is the highest index `i` for which `r` was `'<'` or `0` if no such `i` was found.

Thus, the output will depend on the value of `r`. However, we can provide a precise description based on the given information.

Output: **? [v1] 2 [v1] [prev] (where v1 is the highest index i for which r was '<' or 0 if no such i was found, and prev is 1 if r is '>' otherwise 0)**
