To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the specific values of the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³ (this doesn't affect the current print statement).
- `n` is greater than 1 (the exact value is not specified, but it is greater than 1).
- `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1} (the exact permutation is not specified).
- `I` and `R` are lambda functions (their definitions are not provided, so their impact on the current print statement is unknown).
- `g` is 0 (this doesn't affect the current print statement).
- `prev` is the largest index `i` for which the response `r` was `>` during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` was found (the exact value is not specified).
- `i` is `n-1` (this doesn't affect the current print statement).
- `kp` is 2 (this doesn't affect the current print statement).
- `v2` is `n-1` (this is explicitly given).
- `v1` is `n-1` if `r` is `<`. If `r` is not `<`, the state of the variables remains unchanged as per the precondition (since the condition about `r` is not met, `v1` remains `n-1`).

Given these details, the `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Substituting the known values:
- `v1` is `n-1`
- `v2` is `n-1`

Thus, the print statement will output:
```
? n-1 n-1 n-1 n-1
```

Output: **? n-1 n-1 n-1 n-1**
