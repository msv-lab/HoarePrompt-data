The given code snippet assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Since `v2` is initially set to `i`, and `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we assume `i` is a placeholder for whatever value `v2` holds. After the assignment, `v1` will have the same value as `v2`.

Given that `v2` is `i` and no further details about `i` are provided, we can only state that `v1` now holds the value of `v2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is `v2`, `v2` is `i`, `r` is the input string and `r` equals '<'**.
