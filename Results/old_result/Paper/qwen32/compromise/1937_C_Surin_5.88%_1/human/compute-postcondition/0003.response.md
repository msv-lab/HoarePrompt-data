The code snippet reassigns the value of `n` by reading a new integer from the input. This means the original value of `n` (which was an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴) is replaced by whatever positive integer greater than or equal to 1 is provided by the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the new input integer, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer.**
