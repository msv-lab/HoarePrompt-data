Reasoning:  
The provided program does not solve the problem correctly. The task is to find the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. To maximize this sum, the array should be sorted in a way that maximizes the positive differences and minimizes the negative ones. Specifically, one should sort the array in ascending order to maximize the beauty, as the differences between consecutive elements will be maximized.

However, the given program sorts the array and prints the sorted array. It does not compute the beauty of the array. To be correct, the program should compute the beauty by iterating through the sorted array and summing up the differences between consecutive elements.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect as it does not compute the required beauty of the array.

Correctness: **False**
