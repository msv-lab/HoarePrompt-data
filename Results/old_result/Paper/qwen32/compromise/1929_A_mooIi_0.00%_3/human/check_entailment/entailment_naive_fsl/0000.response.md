Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The task is to find the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, the array should be rearranged such that the differences are maximized. This can be achieved by sorting the array in either ascending or descending order, as the largest differences will be between consecutive elements in these orders.

However, the provided program sorts the array and then prints the sorted array as a string, which is not the required output. The program does not calculate the beauty of the array after sorting it. Instead, it should compute the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array and print that sum for each test case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        beauty = sum(ar[i] - ar[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version sorts the array, calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements, and prints the beauty for each test case.
