### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The task is to find the maximum beauty of the array, which is the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. The beauty is maximized by sorting the array in either ascending or descending order, as this will maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

However, the provided program sorts the array and prints the sorted array as a string, which is not the required output. It does not compute the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. Instead, it should calculate the beauty and print that sum for each test case.

The annotated code confirms that the program sorts the array and prints it, but it does not perform the necessary calculations to determine the beauty of the array. Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem description.

### Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect.
