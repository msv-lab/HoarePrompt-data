The value of `t` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains equal to `N`, and `N` is still greater than 0. The loop has finished executing and is not affected by the increment of `t`.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `N`, `N` is greater than 0, `t` is incremented by 1, and the loop has finished executing.**
