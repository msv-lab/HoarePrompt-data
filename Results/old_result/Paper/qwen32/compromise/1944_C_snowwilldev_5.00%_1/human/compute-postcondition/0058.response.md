Postcondition: **`t` is 2 if `cnt[i]` is equal to 1, otherwise `t` remains 1; `i` is 0; `tc` is `tc + N`; `N` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers based on the input provided; `cnt` is a defaultdict with the count of each element in `a` incremented by the number of times it appears; and if `(t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0)`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
