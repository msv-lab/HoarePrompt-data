Let's break down the problem step-by-step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is initially 2.
   - `cnt[i]` is the count of the element at index `i` in the list `a`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `tc` is `tc + N`, where `N` is greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `cnt` is a `defaultdict` that keeps track of the count of each element in `a`.

2. **Condition for `t`:**
   - If `t` was initially 2 and `cnt[i]` is equal to 1, then `t` is set to 3.
   - Otherwise, `t` remains 2 if `cnt[i]` is equal to 1.
   - If `cnt[i]` is not equal to 1, `t` remains unchanged.

3. **Relevant Information for `print(i)`:**
   - The value of `i` is explicitly given as 1.
   - The value of `t` and `tc` are not directly relevant to the `print(i)` statement.
   - The list `a` and the `defaultdict` `cnt` are not directly relevant to the `print(i)` statement either, as they do not affect the value of `i`.

Given the above information, the value of `i` is explicitly 1. Therefore, the `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`.

Output: **1**
