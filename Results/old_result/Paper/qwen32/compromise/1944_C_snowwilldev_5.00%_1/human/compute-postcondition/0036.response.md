The given Python code snippet initializes a `defaultdict` named `cnt` with a default integer value of 0 for all keys. This does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `tc`, `N`, or `a`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the addition of the `cnt` dictionary.

Output State: **`t` is the count of unique elements in `a` that appear exactly once, `i` is `N-1`, `tc` is `tc + 1`, `N` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers based on the input provided, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 for all keys.**
