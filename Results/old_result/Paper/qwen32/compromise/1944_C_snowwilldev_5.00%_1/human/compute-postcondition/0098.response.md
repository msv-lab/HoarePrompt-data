To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop based on the provided conditions and states.

Given:
- **Initial State:** `i` is equal to `N-1`, `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `t` is 0.
- **Loop:** It iterates `i` from 0 to `N-1`.
- **Condition:** If `cnt[i] == 1`, `t` is incremented by 1. If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, the loop breaks and `i` is printed.

From the provided output states after the first 3 iterations:
1. **After 1st iteration:** `i` is `N-1`, `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented, `t` is potentially incremented if `cnt[N-1] == 1`.
2. **After 2nd iteration:** `i` is `N-2`, `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented, `t` is potentially incremented if `cnt[N-2] == 1`.
3. **After 3rd iteration:** `i` is `N-3`, `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented, `t` is potentially incremented if `cnt[N-3] == 1`.

The loop continues until `i` reaches `0` or the condition `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0` is met.

**Final Output State Analysis:**
- The loop will iterate from `i = N-1` to `i = 0`.
- For each iteration, `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented.
- `t` is incremented by 1 every time `cnt[i]` equals 1.
- The loop breaks if `t` becomes 2 or if `cnt[i]` equals 0.

The final state will depend on the values of `cnt[a[i]]` for each `i` from `N-1` to `0` and how many times `cnt[i]` equals 1.

**Possible Scenarios:**
1. If `cnt[a[i]] == 1` for exactly two values of `i`, `t` will reach 2, and the loop will break, printing the value of `i` at that point.
2. If `cnt[a[i]] == 0` for any value of `i`, the loop will break, printing the value of `i` at that point.
3. If `cnt[a[i]] == 1` for less than two values of `i` and `cnt[a[i]] != 0` for all `i`, the loop will complete all iterations, and no value will be printed inside the loop.

Given the constraints, the loop will break as soon as `t` reaches 2 or `cnt[i]` equals 0. Therefore, the final output state will be the value of `i` at the point where the loop breaks.

**Output State:** **The value of `i` at the point where the loop breaks (either `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`).**

In simple terms, the final output state is the value of `i` when the loop condition to break is met.
