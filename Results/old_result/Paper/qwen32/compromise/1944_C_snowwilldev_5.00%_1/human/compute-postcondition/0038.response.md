The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element at index `i` in the list `a` within the `cnt` dictionary. Given that `i` is `N-1`, it specifically targets the last element of the list `a`.

Since `cnt` is a `defaultdict` with default integer value 0, if `a[i]` (the last element of `a`) has not been encountered before, it will be added to the dictionary with a count of 1. If it has been encountered before, its count will be incremented by 1.

The variable `t` (the count of unique elements in `a` that appear exactly once) may change depending on the new count of `a[i]`. If `a[i]` was previously counted exactly once, and now it is counted twice, `t` should be decremented by 1. If `a[i]` was not counted before, `t` should remain unchanged initially, but if `a[i]` is now counted exactly once, `t` should be incremented by 1. If `a[i]` was counted more than once before, `t` remains unchanged.

The other variables `i`, `tc`, `N`, and the list `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the updated count of unique elements in `a` that appear exactly once, `i` is `N-1`, `tc` is `tc + 1`, `N` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers based on the input provided, `cnt` is a defaultdict with the count of `a[i]` incremented by 1.**
