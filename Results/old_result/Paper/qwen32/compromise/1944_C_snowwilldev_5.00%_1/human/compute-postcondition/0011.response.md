The value of `t` is reassigned to 0. The values of `N`, `a`, `cnt`, and `i` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`t` is 0, `N` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer value 0 for all keys except for each integer `x` in `a`, `cnt[x]` is the number of times `x` appears in `a`, `i` is N-1.**
