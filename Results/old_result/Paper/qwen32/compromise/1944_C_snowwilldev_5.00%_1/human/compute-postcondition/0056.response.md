Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is set to 2 if `cnt[i]` is equal to 1, otherwise `t` remains 1.
2. `i` is initialized to 0.
3. `tc` is incremented by `N` (though `tc` is not used in the provided print statement, it's mentioned for context).
4. `N` is greater than 0.
5. `a` is a list of integers.
6. `cnt` is a `defaultdict` that counts the occurrences of each element in `a`.
7. The condition `(t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0)` is checked. If true, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- The value of `t` depends on `cnt[i]`, but since `i` is 0 initially, `t` will be set to 2 if `cnt[0]` is 1, otherwise `t` will remain 1.
- The condition `(t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0)` is checked. If `t` is 2 (which means `cnt[0]` is 1), the condition is true, and the loop or if statement would break. If `t` is 1 (which means `cnt[0]` is not 1), the condition could still be true if `cnt[0]` is 0.
- Regardless of the value of `t` or `cnt[0]`, the `print(i)` statement is executed before the condition is checked, and `i` is still 0 at that point.

### Conclusion:
The value of `i` when the `print(i)` statement is executed is 0.

Output: **0**
