Postcondition: **`t` is either 0 or 1, `N` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cnt` is a defaultdict where `cnt[x]` is the number of times `x` appears in `a` for each integer `x` in `a`, and the current value of `i` is `N-1`. If `cnt[i]` is equal to 1, then `t` is set to 1. Otherwise, `t` remains 0.**
