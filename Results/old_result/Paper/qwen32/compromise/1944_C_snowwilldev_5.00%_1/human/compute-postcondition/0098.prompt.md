Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to `N-1`, and `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1; `t` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(N):
    if cnt[i] == 1:
        t += 1
    if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
        print(i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is equal to `N-1`, `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `N` is greater than 0. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues to execute without breaking out of the loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is equal to `N`, `N` is greater than 0, and the loop has finished executing. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 0, `N` is greater than 0. If `t` was initially less than 2 and `cnt[i]` was equal to 1, then `t` is increased by 1. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of without changing `t`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
