Postcondition: **`t` is either 0 or 2, `N` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cnt` is a defaultdict where `cnt[x]` is the number of times `x` appears in `a` for each integer `x` in `a`, and the current value of `i` is `N-2`. If `cnt[i] == 1`, then `t` is set to 2. Otherwise, `t` remains 0.**
