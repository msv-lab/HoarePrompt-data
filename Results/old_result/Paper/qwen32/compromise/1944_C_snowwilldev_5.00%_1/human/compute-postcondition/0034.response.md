The code snippet provided is:
```
N = int(input())
```
This line of code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `N`. The initial state mentions `t`, `i`, and `tc` with specific conditions or values, but none of these are affected by the execution of this line of code. Therefore, the output state will only reflect the new value of `N` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the count of unique elements in `a` that appear exactly once, `i` is `N-1`, `tc` is `tc + 1`, `N` is an input integer.**
