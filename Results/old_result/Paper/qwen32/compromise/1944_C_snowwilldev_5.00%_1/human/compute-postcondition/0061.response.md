Postcondition: **`t` is 3 if `t` was initially 2 and `cnt[i]` is equal to 1, otherwise `t` remains 2 if `cnt[i]` is equal to 1. If `cnt[i]` is not equal to 1, `t` remains unchanged. `i` is 1, `tc` is `tc + N`, `N` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers based on the input provided, and `cnt` is a defaultdict with the count of each element in `a` incremented by the number of times it appears.**
