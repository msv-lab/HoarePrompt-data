t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case. Each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The total number of stones across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
