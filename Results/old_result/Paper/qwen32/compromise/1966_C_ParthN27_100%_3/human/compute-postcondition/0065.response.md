To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the loop head, which includes the variables `i`, `n`, and implicitly the list `s` since the loop iterates over its indices.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `arr` is the list of integers read from the input.
- `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements of `arr` with `0` prepended.
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n - 2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken a value from `1` to `n - 2`. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

Let's assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, where `1 ≤ k < n - 1`. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

The state of `n` remains unchanged, and `s` also remains unchanged because the loop head does not modify these variables directly.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is the list of integers read from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements of `arr` with `0` prepended, `i` is `k + 1` where `2 ≤ k + 1 < n - 1`**

To make it more specific, if we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `k`, the start of the next iteration will have `i` as `k + 1`.

Since we do not have the exact value of `k`, we can generalize the state as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is the list of integers read from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements of `arr` with `0` prepended, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**

If we assume the previous value of `i` was `k`, then the next value of `i` will be `k + 1`. So, if `i` was `1` at the end of the first iteration, it will be `2` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is the list of integers read from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements of `arr` with `0` prepended, `i` is 2**

This is the state at the start of the second iteration. For the general case, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is the list of integers read from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements of `arr` with `0` prepended, `i` is `k + 1`**

Since we do not have the exact value of `k`, we can represent the state as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is the list of integers read from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements of `arr` with `0` prepended, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**

For the sake of providing a concrete example, let's assume `i` was `1` at the end of the first iteration. Then the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is the list of integers read from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements of `arr` with `0` prepended, `i` is 2**
