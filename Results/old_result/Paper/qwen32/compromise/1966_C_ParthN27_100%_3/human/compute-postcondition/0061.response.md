Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is the list of integers read from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements of `arr` with `0` prepended, `ans` is 1, and `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is greater than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
