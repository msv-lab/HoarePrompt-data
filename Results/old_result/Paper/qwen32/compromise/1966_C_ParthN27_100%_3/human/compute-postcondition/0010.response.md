To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables evolve.

The loop iterates `n` times, and in each iteration, it adds the element at the current index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Since sets do not allow duplicate elements, each unique element from `arr` will be added to `s` only once.

The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. After all iterations, the set `s` will contain all unique elements from the list `arr`.

Here's the final output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is a set containing all unique elements from `arr`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the set `s` will include every unique integer from the list `arr`, while the values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
