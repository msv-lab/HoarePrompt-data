The code snippet `s.sort()` sorts the list `s` in ascending order. The other variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is the list of integers read from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements of `arr`, and `ans` is 1 if `n` is 2, or 1 if `n-2` is even, and 0 if `n-2` is odd.**
