The code snippet `s = list(s)` converts the set `s` into a list. The set `s` originally contains all unique elements from the list `arr`. After the conversion, `s` is now a list containing the same unique elements that were originally in the set.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is the list of integers read from the input, `s` is a list containing all unique elements of `arr`, and `ans` is 1 if `n` is 2, or 1 if `n-2` is even, and 0 if `n-2` is odd.**
