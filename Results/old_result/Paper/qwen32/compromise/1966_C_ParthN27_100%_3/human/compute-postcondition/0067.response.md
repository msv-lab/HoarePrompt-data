The code snippet `ans ^= 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation on the variable `ans` with the integer `1`. This operation will flip the least significant bit of `ans`. If `ans` was `0`, it will become `1`, and if `ans` was `1`, it will become `0`.

Given the initial state, the value of `ans` is not explicitly provided, but we can describe the change that occurs. The other variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is the list of integers read from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements of `arr` with `0` prepended, `i` is 2, `ans` is flipped (if `ans` was 0, it is now 1; if `ans` was 1, it is now 0).**
