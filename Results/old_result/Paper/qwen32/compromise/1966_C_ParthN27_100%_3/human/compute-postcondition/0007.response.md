The code adds the element `arr[i]` to the set `s`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 in the initial state, so `arr[i]` refers to the next element in the list `arr` after the previous one added to the set. This addition ensures that `s` will contain unique elements from `arr` up to the current index `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is a set containing the element `arr[i]` and possibly other elements from `arr`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
