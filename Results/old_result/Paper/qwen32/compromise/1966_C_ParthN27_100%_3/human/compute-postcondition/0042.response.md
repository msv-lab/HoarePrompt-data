The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `arr`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that will be affected is `arr`, as it will be reassigned to the list of integers provided by the user input. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `arr` is the list of integers read from the input, `s` is a sorted list with `0` as the first element, followed by all unique elements from `arr`. If `n` is 2, `ans` remains 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 if `n-2` is even, and `ans` is 0 if `n-2` is odd.**
