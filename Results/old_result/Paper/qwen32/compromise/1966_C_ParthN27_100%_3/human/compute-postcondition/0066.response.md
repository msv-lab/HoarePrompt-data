Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is the list of integers read from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements of `arr` with `0` prepended, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
