The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Given that `i` is `i + 1 - 1`, it simplifies to `i`, so the element `arr[i]` is added to the set `s`.

Since `s` initially contains the element `arr[i]` and possibly other elements, adding `arr[i]` again will not change the set because sets do not allow duplicate elements.

Therefore, the set `s` remains the same, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is a set containing the element `arr[i]` and possibly other elements from `arr`, `i` is `i + 1 - 1`**
