The code snippet `ans ^= 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `ans` and 1. This operation will flip the least significant bit of `ans`, changing it from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the length of the list `s` where `n` > 2
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input
- `s` is a sorted list with `0` as the first element, followed by all unique elements from `arr`
- `i` is 4
- `ans` is set to 0 if `s[i] - s[i - 1] <= 1`

The value of `ans` is initially 0 if the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] <= 1` is true. After executing `ans ^= 1`, the value of `ans` will be flipped to 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the length of the list `s` where `n` > 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is a sorted list with `0` as the first element, followed by all unique elements from `arr`, `i` is 4, `ans` is 1 if `s[i] - s[i - 1] <= 1` was initially true, otherwise `ans` is 0 if `s[i] - s[i - 1] <= 1` was initially false and then flipped to 1.**
