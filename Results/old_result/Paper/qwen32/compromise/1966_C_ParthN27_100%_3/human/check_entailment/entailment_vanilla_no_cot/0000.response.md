Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules described. The game essentially revolves around the concept of Nim-sum (XOR-sum) of the pile sizes, which is a well-known strategy in combinatorial game theory. If the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is zero at the start of the game, Bob wins (assuming both play optimally); otherwise, Alice wins.

The current program attempts to use a different approach by sorting the unique pile sizes and then checking the differences between consecutive sizes. This approach does not correctly reflect the rules and optimal strategy of the game.

Here is a correct implementation of the game based on the Nim-sum concept:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nim_sum = 0
        for a in arr:
            nim_sum ^= a
        if nim_sum == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

This program calculates the Nim-sum of the pile sizes and determines the winner based on whether the Nim-sum is zero or not.
