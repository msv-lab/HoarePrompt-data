You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s , consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or
question marks.

A tandem repeat is a string of an even length such that its first half is
equal to its second half.

A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by the
deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and
several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

Your goal is to replace each question mark with some lowercase Latin letter in
such a way that the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat is
maximum possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The only line of each testcase contains a string s (1 \le |s| \le 5000 ),
consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.

The total length of the strings over all testcases doesn't exceed 5000 .

Output

For each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum length of the longest
substring that is a tandem repeat after you replace each question mark in the
string with some lowercase Latin letter.

If it's impossible to make any tandem repeat substrings in the string, print 0
.

Example

Input

    4
    
    zaabaabz
    
    ?????
    
    code?????s
    
    codeforces

Output

    6
    4
    10
    0

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
    print(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a string `s` from the input, checks for specific patterns within the string, and prints the length of the longest palindromic substring that can be formed by replacing question marks with matching characters. If no such substring is found, it prints 0. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the problem description in all cases. Specifically, the code does not replace question marks with lowercase Latin letters to maximize the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat. Instead, it only checks for existing characters or question marks that could form a tandem repeat without replacing the question marks.

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
a?b?a?
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
By replacing the question marks with appropriate characters, we can form a tandem repeat of length 4. For example, replacing the question marks with 'a' results in the string "aabbaa", which contains a tandem repeat "aabb" of length 4.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
0
```

The program incorrectly outputs 0 because it does not attempt to replace the question marks to form a tandem repeat. Instead, it only checks for existing characters or question marks that could form a tandem repeat, which in this case, do not exist without replacements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
