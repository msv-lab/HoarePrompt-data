Let's analyze the given conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is 1.
   - `n` is at least 4.
   - `k` is 3.
   - `s[k]` is not equal to '?'.
   - `s[k + j]` is not equal to '?'.
   - `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.

2. **Conditions and Logic:**
   - The condition `s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]` is checked.
   - Given the initial state, `s[k]` is not equal to '?', `s[k + j]` is not equal to '?', and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`, this condition evaluates to `False`.
   - Since the condition is `False`, `count` is set to 0.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(count * 2)` will execute after the condition check.
   - Since `count` is set to 0, `count * 2` will be `0`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **0**
