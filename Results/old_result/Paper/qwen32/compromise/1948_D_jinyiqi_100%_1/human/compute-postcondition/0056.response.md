The only variable in the loop head is `j`, and the range function is defined as `range(n // 2, 0, -1)`. This means `j` starts from `n // 2` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 1 (inclusive), since the stop value in the range function is exclusive.

Given that the program completes without printing anything, it implies that the loop did not execute even once. This can only happen if the start value of the range is less than the stop value (0 in this case), meaning `n // 2` must be less than 1.

However, to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `j` is set to a value that is within the range that would allow the loop to run. Since the loop decrements `j` by 1 each iteration and stops when `j` is 0, we need to set `j` to 1 at the start of the loop for it to execute.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be set to 1, and `n // 2` must be at least 1 (so that the loop can start with `j` as 1).

State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be at least 2**
