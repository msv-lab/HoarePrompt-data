Output State: **The program does not return any value.**

Explanation: The provided Python code snippet does not contain a return statement that returns a specific value or variable. It only contains a return statement without any expression, which means the function will return `None` by default. However, since the task specifies to only mention a return if it takes place, and in this case, no specific value or variable is returned, the output state reflects that no return occurs.
