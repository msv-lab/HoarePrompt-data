Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters with length `n` where 2 <= n <= 5000, `n` is the length of `s`, `j` is 1, `k` is `n - j`. If either `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` is 0.**
