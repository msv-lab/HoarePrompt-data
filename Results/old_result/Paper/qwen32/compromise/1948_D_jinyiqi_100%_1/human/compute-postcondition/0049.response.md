Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters with length `n` where 2 <= n <= 5000, `j` is 1, `k` is `n - j`. If either `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 3. Otherwise, `count` is 1. Additionally, `count` is not equal to `j`. The program returns nothing.**

In simple terms, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1. The conditions regarding `t`, `s`, `j`, `k`, and the relationship between `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` remain unchanged.
