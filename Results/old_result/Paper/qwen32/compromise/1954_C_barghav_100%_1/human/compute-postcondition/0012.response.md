Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads two integers `x` and `y` of the same length, each consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and prints them after performing a specific transformation. The transformation involves swapping the digits at the first position where `x` is less than `y` and any subsequent positions where `x` is greater than `y`. The function processes one test case at a time and outputs the modified `x` and `y` separately.**
