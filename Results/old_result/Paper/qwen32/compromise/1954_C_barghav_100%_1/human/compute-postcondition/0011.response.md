Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. It processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y` with the same length, and both integers consist only of digits from 1 to 9. For each test case, the function returns a result based on the comparison or some operation on `x` and `y`.**
