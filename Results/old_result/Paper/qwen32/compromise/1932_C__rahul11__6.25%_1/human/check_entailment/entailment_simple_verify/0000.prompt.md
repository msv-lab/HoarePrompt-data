You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Output

    0 2 4 1 
    0 0 0 0 0 
    0 0 0 4 4 4 
    0 
    
Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a critical flaw in how it updates the product of the array elements (`ans`) when removing elements based on the commands. Specifically, the program uses integer division (`//`) to update the product, which is incorrect because the product of integers should be updated by multiplying or dividing by the exact values, not by using integer division. This can lead to incorrect results, especially when the product is not perfectly divisible by the element being removed.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3 2
2 2 2
RRR
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 0 0
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0 0 1
```

**Explanation of the Issue:**
1. The initial product is `2 * 2 * 2 = 8`.
2. The remainder when divided by 2 is `0`.
3. The first command is 'R', so the rightmost element (2) is removed. The product should be `8 // 2 = 4`, and the remainder when divided by 2 is `0`.
4. The second command is 'R', so the new rightmost element (2) is removed. The product should be `4 // 2 = 2`, and the remainder when divided by 2 is `0`.
5. The third command is 'R', so the new rightmost element (2) is removed. The product should be `2 // 2 = 1`, and the remainder when divided by 2 is `1`.

However, the program incorrectly calculates the product using integer division, leading to the incorrect output of `0 0 1`.

To fix this, the program should maintain the product correctly by multiplying and dividing by the exact values without using integer division. Here's the corrected part of the code:

```python
def func():
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = [0] * n
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans = (ans * i) % m
        res[0] = ans
        c = 1
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = (ans * pow(arr[l], -1, m)) % m  # Use modular multiplicative inverse
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = (ans * pow(arr[r], -1, m)) % m  # Use modular multiplicative inverse
                r -= 1
            res[c] = ans
            c += 1
        print(*res)
```

In this corrected version, the modular multiplicative inverse is used to correctly divide the product by the element being removed. This ensures that the product is updated correctly and the remainders are computed accurately.
