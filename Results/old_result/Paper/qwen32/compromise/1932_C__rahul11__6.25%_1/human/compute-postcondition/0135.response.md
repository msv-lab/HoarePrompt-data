Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer obtained from the input, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `k` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `l` is incremented by 1, `r` is decremented by 1 if `s[k] != 'L'`, `res` is a list of `n` integers where `res[0]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `res[1]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, and all other `res[i]` for `i` not equal to `0`, `1`, or `c` are `0`, `c` is incremented by 1`**

In simple terms: The value of `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`. The value of `l` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged unless `s[k] != 'L'`, in which case `r` is also decremented by 1.
