Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is at least 2; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is `ans % m % MOD` and the rest are 0; `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` except the last element, then divided by `arr[r]` and taken modulo `MOD`; `c` is 1; `l` is 0; `r` is `n-1`; `s[k]` is not equal to 'L'**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is recalculated by dividing the previous product of all elements in `arr` by the last element `arr[r]` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged.
