The given code snippet is `ans *= i`. This line of code multiplies the current value of `ans` by the value of `i`. However, the initial state does not specify what the value of `i` is. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact new value of `ans`. Therefore, we will represent the new value of `ans` as `ans * i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is 0; `ans` is `ans * i`; `c` is `n`; `l` is the number of 'L' characters encountered in `s`; `r` is `n-1` minus the number of 'R' characters encountered in `s`.**
