The code snippet provided only increments the variable `c` by 1. None of the other variables are affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer obtained from the input, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, the second element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, and the third element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `c` is 3, `k` is incremented by 1. If `s[k]` was 'L', then `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD` and `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD` and `r` is decremented by 1.**
