To determine what will be printed by the `print(*res)` statement, we need to understand the structure and values of the `res` list based on the given initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (This variable does not directly affect the `res` list).
- `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input.
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string.
- `res` is a list of `n` elements where the first `n-1` elements are `ans % m % MOD` and the last element is 0.
- `ans` is the result of the final division/modulo operations based on the characters in `s`.
- `c` is `n` (This variable does not directly affect the `res` list).
- `l` and `r` depend on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s` (These variables do not directly affect the `res` list).

### Key Points:
- The `res` list has `n` elements.
- The first `n-1` elements of `res` are `ans % m % MOD`.
- The last element of `res` is `0`.

### Determining the Output:
Given this, the output will be a sequence of `n-1` occurrences of `ans % m % MOD` followed by `0`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, and `ans` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans % m % MOD`. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans % m % MOD, ans % m % MOD, ..., ans % m % MOD, 0 (where there are n-1 occurrences of ans % m % MOD)**
