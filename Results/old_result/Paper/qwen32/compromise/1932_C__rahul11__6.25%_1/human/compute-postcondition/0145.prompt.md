Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5 and 1 <= m <= 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^4 for each i; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'; the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5; `MOD` is 1000000006.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = list(input())
    res = [0] * n
    ans = 1
    for i in arr:
        ans *= i
    res[0] = ans % m % MOD
    c = 1
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for k in range(n - 1):
        if s[k] == 'L':
            ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
            res[c] = ans % m % MOD
            l += 1
        else:
            ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
            res[c] = ans % m % MOD
            r -= 1
        c += 1
    print(*res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element at index `i` is the value of `ans` at that step of the loop, modulo `m`, modulo `MOD`; `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` divided by the elements removed based on `s`, modulo `MOD`; `c` is `n`; `l` is the number of 'L' characters encountered in `s`; `r` is `n-1` minus the number of 'R' characters encountered in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list of `n` elements where the first `n-1` elements are `ans % m % MOD` and the last element is 0; `ans` is the result of the final division/modulo operations based on the characters in `s`; `c` is `n`; `l` and `r` depend on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the new input string; `res` is a list of `n` integers where the first `n - 1` elements are the results of the operations described in the loop, and the last element is `0`; `ans` is the result of dividing the initial product of all elements in `arr` by each element in `arr` exactly once, taken modulo `MOD`; `c` is `n`; `l` and `r` are equal to the middle index of `arr` if `n` is odd, or one of the middle indices if `n` is even.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
