Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the new input string; `res` is a list of `n` zeros, with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD`; `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr`; `c` is 1; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(n - 1):
    if s[k] == 'L':
        ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        l += 1
    else:
        ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        r -= 1
    c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is at least 2; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the new input string; `res` is a list of `n` zeros, with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD` and the second element updated to `ans % m % MOD`. If the current character at index `k` in `s` is 'L', then `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` divided by `arr[l]` modulo `MOD`, `l` is 1, and `r` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` except the last element, then taken modulo `MOD`, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 2`. In both cases, `c` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer obtained from the input, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `k` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to either `ans // arr[l] % MOD` if `s[k] == 'L'` or `(ans // arr[r]) % MOD` if `s[k] != 'L'`, `l` is incremented by 1 if `s[k] == 'L'`, `r` is decremented by 1 if `s[k] != 'L'`, and `res` is a list of `n` integers where `res[0]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `res[1]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, and all other `res[i]` for `i` not equal to `0`, `1`, or `c` are `0`. `c` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer obtained from the input, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `k` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to either `ans // arr[l] % MOD` if `s[k] == 'L'` or `(ans // arr[r]) % MOD` if `s[k] != 'L'`, `l` is incremented by 1 if `s[k] == 'L'`, `r` is decremented by 1 if `s[k] != 'L'`, `res` is a list of `n` integers where `res[0]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `res[1]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, and all other `res[i]` for `i` not equal to `0`, `1`, or `c` are `0`, `c` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
