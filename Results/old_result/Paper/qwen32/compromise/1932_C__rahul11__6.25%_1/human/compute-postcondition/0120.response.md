Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is at least 2; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the new input string; `res` is a list of `n` zeros, with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD`; `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` except the last element, then taken modulo `MOD`; `c` is 1; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; the `k`-th element of `s` is not 'L'**

Explanation: The value of `ans` has been updated to the product of all elements in `arr` except the last element, then taken modulo `MOD`. All other variables retain their initial values.
