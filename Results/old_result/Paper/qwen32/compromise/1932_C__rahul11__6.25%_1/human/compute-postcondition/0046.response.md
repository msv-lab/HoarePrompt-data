The code snippet provided only increments the variable `c` by 1. None of the other variables (`k`, `s`, `ans`, `res`, `l`, `arr`, `MOD`, `m`, `r`) are modified in the given code. Therefore, the only change in the state is the value of `c`.

Output State: **`k` is `i + 1`. If `s[k] == 'L'`, then `ans` is `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, and `l` is `l + 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, and `r` is decreased by 1. `c` is increased by 1.**
