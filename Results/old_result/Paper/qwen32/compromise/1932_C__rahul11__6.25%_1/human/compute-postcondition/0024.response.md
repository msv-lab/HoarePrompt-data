Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD`; `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` divided by `arr[r]` modulo `MOD`; `c` is 1; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `s[k]` is not equal to 'L'.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` has been updated to the result of the product of all elements in `arr` divided by `arr[r]`, then taken modulo `MOD`. All other variables retain their initial values.
