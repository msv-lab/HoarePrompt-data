The code snippet `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Given the initial state, `l` is initially 1. After the increment, `l` becomes 2.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is at least 2; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is `ans % m % MOD`, the second element is `ans % m % MOD`, and the third element is also `ans % m % MOD`, and the rest are 0; `ans` is updated to `(ans // arr[l]) % MOD`; `c` is 2; `k` is 2; `l` is 2**.
