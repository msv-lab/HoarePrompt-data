The code snippet provided updates the `arr` variable by reading a new list of integers from the input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `res`, `ans`, `c`, `l`, `r`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list of `n` elements where the first `n-1` elements are `ans % m % MOD` and the last element is 0; `ans` is the result of the final division/modulo operations based on the characters in `s`; `c` is `n`; `l` and `r` depend on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`.**
