Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer obtained from the input, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the `c`-th element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `k` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`.**

Natural Language: The value of the `c`-th element in the list `res` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`. All other variables retain their previous values, except for `k` which is incremented by 1, and `ans` which is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`.
