The code snippet provided multiplies the variable `ans` by the value of `i`. Given that `i` is `arr[1]`, the value of `ans` will be updated to `ans * arr[1]`. No other variables are affected by this code execution.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is 0, `ans` is `ans * arr[1]`, `c` is `n`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters encountered in `s`, `r` is `n-1` minus the number of 'R' characters encountered in `s`, and `i` is `arr[1]`.**
