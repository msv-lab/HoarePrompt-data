The code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component into an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `arr`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
