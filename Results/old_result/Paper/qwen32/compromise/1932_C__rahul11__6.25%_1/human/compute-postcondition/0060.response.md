The given code snippet is `ans *= i`. This means the value of `ans` is updated to be the product of its current value and the value of `i`.

Given the initial state, `ans` is already the product of its previous value and `arr[1]`. Now, it will be further multiplied by `i`, which is defined as `arr[2]`.

Therefore, the new value of `ans` will be the product of its previous value (which was `ans * arr[1]`) and `arr[2]`. So, the new value of `ans` will be `ans * arr[1] * arr[2]`.

No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is 0, `ans` is `ans * arr[1] * arr[2]`, `c` is `n`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters encountered in `s`, `r` is `n-1` minus the number of 'R' characters encountered in `s`, and `i` is `arr[2]`.**
