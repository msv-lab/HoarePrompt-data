To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given initial state and the outputs after the first 3 iterations.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` and `m` are integers read from input such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5.
   - `a` is a binary string of length `n`.
   - `b` is a binary string of length `m`.
   - `k` is initialized to 0.
   - `j` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Body:**
   - The outer loop runs `n` times, iterating over each character of `a`.
   - The inner `while` loop increments `j` until it finds a character in `b` that matches `a[i]` or until `j` reaches `m`.
   - If a match is found (`j < m`), `k` is incremented by 1 and `j` is incremented by 1.
   - If no match is found (`j == m`), the loop breaks.

### Observations from the Output States:
- **After 1st Iteration:**
  - `b[0]` is the opposite of `a[0]`, so no match is found, and `j` reaches `m`. `k` remains 0.
- **After 2nd Iteration:**
  - `j` is already `m`, so the inner `while` loop does not execute, and the loop breaks.
- **After 3rd Iteration:**
  - The loop breaks after the 2nd iteration, so the 3rd iteration does not occur.

### Final Output State:
Since the loop breaks after the 2nd iteration, the loop does not run for all `n` iterations. Therefore, the final state of the variables is:
- `i` will be 1 (since the loop breaks after the 2nd iteration, which corresponds to `i = 1`).
- `j` will be `m` (since the inner `while` loop reaches `m` in the 1st iteration and does not change in subsequent iterations).
- `k` will be 0 (since no matches were found in the 1st iteration, and the loop breaks after the 2nd iteration).

### Output State:
Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `m`, and `k` is 0.**

In natural language, after all the executions of the loop have finished, the variable `i` is 1, `j` is equal to the length of string `b`, and `k` is 0, indicating that no characters from `a` were found in `b` during the first two iterations, and the loop broke early.
