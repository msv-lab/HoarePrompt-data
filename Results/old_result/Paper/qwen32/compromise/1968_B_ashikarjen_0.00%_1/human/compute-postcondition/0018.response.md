Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from input such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a binary string of length `n` read from input; `b` is a new binary string read from input where `b[0]` is the opposite of `a[0]`. If `j` is less than `m`, then `k` is set to 1 and `j` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `k` is 0 and `j` is equal to `m`.**
