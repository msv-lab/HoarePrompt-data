The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `j` is 2, so after the operation, `j` becomes 3. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from input such that 1 ≤ n, m > 2; `a` is a binary string of length `n` read from input; `b` is a new binary string read from input where `b[0]` is the opposite of `a[0]`; `k` is 0; `j` is 3**.
