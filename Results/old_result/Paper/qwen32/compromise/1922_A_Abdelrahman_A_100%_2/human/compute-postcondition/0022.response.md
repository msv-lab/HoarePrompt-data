Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the input string, `b` is the input string consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the input string consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, `tests` is greater than or equal to 1, `slength` is an input integer, and `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`. `counter` is 2. `no` is False. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `no` remains `False`, and all other variables retain their initial values.
