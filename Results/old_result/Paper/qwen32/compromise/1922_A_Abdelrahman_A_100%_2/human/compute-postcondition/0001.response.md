In the given task, the for loop will iterate based on the value of the variable `tests`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`) are not directly involved in controlling the execution of the loop. Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes, we only need to adjust the state of `tests`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `tests` must be greater than or equal to 1. Given that `tests` is an input integer, we need to ensure that this condition is met.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, `tests` must be greater than or equal to 1**
