Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new input string consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, `tests` is greater than or equal to 1, `slength` is the input integer, If `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, `no` is True and `counter` is n. Otherwise, the state of `no` and `counter` remains unchanged, `i` is the value from the previous iteration plus 1.** 

Explanation: The variable `c` is reassigned to the new input string. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
