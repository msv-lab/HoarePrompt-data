Let's carefully analyze the initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.
- `a` is the input string.
- `b` is the input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
- `c` is the input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
- `tests` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `slength` is an input integer.
- `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`.
- `counter` is 2.
- `no` is False.
- The condition involving `x` and the loop or if statement does not affect the `print('YES')` statement directly as it is outside the scope of this condition.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```
This `print` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `tests`, `slength`, `counter`, and `no`. The condition involving `x` and the loop or if statement does not impact this particular `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print('YES')` statement will execute and print the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
