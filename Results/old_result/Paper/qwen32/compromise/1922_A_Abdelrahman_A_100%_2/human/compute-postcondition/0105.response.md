Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, all of the same length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). For each test case, it checks if string `c` can be formed by selecting characters from the corresponding positions in strings `a` and `b`. If `c` can be formed in this manner, it outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'.**
