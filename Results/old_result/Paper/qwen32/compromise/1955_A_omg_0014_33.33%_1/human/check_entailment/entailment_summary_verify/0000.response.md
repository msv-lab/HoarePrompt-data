### Reasoning:

The original assessment is **correct** in identifying that the given program is incorrect. Let's break down the issues and validate the reasoning:

1. **Variable Misinterpretation**:
   - The program reads `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case. However, `c` is not defined in the problem description. It seems that `c` is a typo for `b`, which represents the price for two yogurts.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `d = c / 2`, which is incorrect if `c` is meant to be `b`. Even if `c` were correctly interpreted as `b`, the logic for calculating the minimum cost is flawed.
   - The comparison `if a * b < a * d` is incorrect. The program should compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the single yogurt price (`a * n`) with the cost of buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price (`b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`).

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, and `b = 9`:
     - The correct minimum cost is `9 + 5 = 14` (buy two yogurts for 9 burles and one yogurt for 5 burles).
     - The given program calculates `d` as `9 / 2 = 4.5` and then compares `5 * 3 = 15` with `5 * 4.5 = 22.5`, leading to an incorrect result.

### Corrected Program:
The corrected version of the program, as provided in the original assessment, correctly calculates the minimum cost by comparing the cost of buying yogurts individually and in pairs:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the minimum cost
        cost_single = a * n
        cost_pairs = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)
        print(min(cost_single, cost_pairs))

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identifies the issues in the provided program and provides a corrected version. Therefore, the given program is indeed incorrect.

**Final: False**
