Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer, where 1 <= `n` <= 100; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 30.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of an integer input, while the preconditions for `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
