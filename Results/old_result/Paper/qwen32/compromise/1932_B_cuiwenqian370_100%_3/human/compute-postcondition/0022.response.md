The code appends the string representation of `last_year` to the `results` list. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 2 + n; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the string representation of `last_year`; `a` is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is the integer value of `data[index + i - 2]` for 1 <= i <= n; `last_year` is the value obtained after the loop completes all iterations, calculated as `last_year = ((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]` after the last iteration.**
