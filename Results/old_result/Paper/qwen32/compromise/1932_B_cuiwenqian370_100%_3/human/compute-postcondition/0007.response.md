The code snippet assigns the value of `int(data[index])` to the variable `n`. Given that `index` is initially 1, `n` will be assigned the integer value of the second element in the `data` list (since list indices start at 0).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 1; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**
