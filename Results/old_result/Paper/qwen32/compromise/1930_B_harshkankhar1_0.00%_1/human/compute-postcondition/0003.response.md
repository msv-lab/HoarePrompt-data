Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it receives an integer `n` such that 3 <= n <= 10^5. The function returns a result for each test case based on the value of `n`. The total number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, and the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
