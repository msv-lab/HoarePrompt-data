Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. The logic in the code is too simplistic and does not cover all possible scenarios for setting up the stalls with appropriate prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Here are some issues with the current implementation:

1. **First Condition (`n == k`)**: This condition is correct. If Alice has the exact number of coins equal to the number of jewels she wants to buy, Bob can set up a single stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel, and Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.

2. **Second Condition (`n + 2 > k * 2`)**: This condition is incorrect and overly simplistic. It tries to handle cases where Alice has more coins than jewels but does not properly ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. The logic here is flawed because it doesn't take into account the requirement to use at most 60 stalls with prices between 1 and \(10^{18}\).

To correctly solve the problem, Bob needs to set up stalls with prices that allow Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels. One way to do this is to use a binary representation approach where each stall corresponds to a power of 2, allowing for a flexible combination of stalls to sum up to exactly `k` jewels. However, this approach must ensure that the total cost does not exceed `n` coins.

A correct approach would involve more sophisticated logic to determine the prices of the stalls, possibly using a greedy algorithm or dynamic programming to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with the given constraints.

Here is a possible correct implementation:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        if n == k:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(1)
        else:
            prices = []
            remaining = k
            power = 1
            while remaining > 0:
                if remaining & 1:
                    prices.append(power)
                remaining >>= 1
                power *= 2
            if sum(prices) <= n:
                print('YES')
                print(len(prices))
                print(' '.join(map(str, prices)))
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

This implementation uses a binary representation of `k` to determine the prices of the stalls, ensuring that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. It checks if the total cost of the stalls is within the budget `n` and outputs the appropriate prices if possible.
