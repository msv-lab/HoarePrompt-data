Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all cases as specified in the problem description. The program only handles two specific scenarios:
1. When `n == k`, it returns "YES" with one stall priced at 1 coin.
2. When `n + 2 > k * 2`, it returns "YES" with two stalls priced at `n - k + 1` and 1 coin.

However, these conditions do not cover all possible values of `n` and `k`. For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
255 8
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
8
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
```

The provided program will not handle this case correctly because it does not have a mechanism to create up to 60 stalls with appropriate prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The program only checks two specific conditions and does not provide a general solution for all possible values of `n` and `k`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for at least some test cases.
