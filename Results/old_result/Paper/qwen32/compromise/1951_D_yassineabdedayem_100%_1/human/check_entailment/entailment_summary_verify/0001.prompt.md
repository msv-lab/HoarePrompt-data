You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it determines if it's possible to satisfy certain conditions and prints 'YES' followed by specific values if the conditions are met, or 'NO' if they are not. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged after processing each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program in the context of the problem description.

The program is designed to determine if Bob can set up his jewelry store with at most 60 stalls and set prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The program currently handles two specific cases and defaults to "NO" for all other cases. Here is the reasoning step by step:

1. **Case 1: `n == k`**
   - If Alice has exactly as many coins as the number of jewels she wants to buy (`n == k`), Bob can simply set one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel. Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels and spend all her coins.
   - This is correctly handled by the program.

2. **Case 2: `n + 2 > k * 2`**
   - This condition is more complex and not clearly explained in the problem description. It seems to be an attempt to handle some scenarios where `n` is not equal to `k`. However, it is not fully correct or comprehensive.
   - The program suggests setting up two stalls: one with a price of `n - k + 1` and another with a price of 1. This setup is intended to make Alice buy `k` jewels, but it does not guarantee that she will buy exactly `k` jewels in all scenarios.
   - For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` holds (10 + 2 > 4 * 2). The program suggests setting prices as `7` and `1`. Alice will buy 1 jewel at the first stall (spending 7 coins) and 3 jewels at the second stall (spending 3 coins), totaling 4 jewels. However, this is a specific example, and the logic does not cover all cases where `n + 2 > k * 2` would lead to exactly `k` jewels being bought.

3. **Default Case:**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program outputs "NO".
   - This is not a correct approach because there are many other valid ways to set up the stalls that the program does not consider.

The program does not handle all possible scenarios where it is possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. For example, the program does not consider the possibility of using binary representation of `k` to determine the stall prices, which is a valid strategy as mentioned in the problem description (e.g., using powers of 2).

Given the above analysis, the program is not correct for all possible inputs.
