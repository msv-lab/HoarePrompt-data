Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440; Each of the t test cases is a string s of length 5 with the format "hh:mm", where "hh" is a valid hour in 24-hour format (00 to 23) and "mm" is a valid minute (00 to 59); day is 'AM'**

Explanation: The variable `day` is set to the string 'AM'. The initial state of `t` and the test cases `s` remain unchanged.
