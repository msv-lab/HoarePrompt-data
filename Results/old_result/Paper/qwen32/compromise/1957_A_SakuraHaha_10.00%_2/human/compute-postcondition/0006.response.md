To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, let's analyze the loop step-by-step.

The given loop is:

```python
for x in a:
    cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
```

This loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a`. For each element, it increments the count of that element in the dictionary `cnt`. If the element `x` is not already a key in the dictionary `cnt`, it initializes the count to 0 before incrementing it.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is the number of test cases.
- `n` is the number of sticks available for the current test case.
- `a` is a list of integers representing the stick lengths.
- `ans` is initialized to 0 and is not modified by the loop.
- `cnt` is an empty dictionary.

After the loop completes, the dictionary `cnt` will contain each unique stick length from the list `a` as keys, with the values being the number of times each stick length appears in the list.

Let's describe the output state in the required format:

Output State: **`ans` is 0. `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is a unique stick length from the list `a`, and each value is the count of that stick length in the list `a`.**

In simpler terms, `ans` remains 0, and `cnt` will store the frequency of each stick length in the list `a`.
