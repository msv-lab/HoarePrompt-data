Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is `k - 2`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(a[s] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp)`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `i` is 2.`bm` has been updated to `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`**

In simple terms, the value of `bm` has been recalculated to be the maximum of its previous value and the new expression `a[b] * k + bp`. All other variables retain their initial values.
