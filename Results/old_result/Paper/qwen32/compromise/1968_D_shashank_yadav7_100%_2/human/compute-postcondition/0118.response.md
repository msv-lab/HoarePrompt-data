Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is either 0 or the second integer read from the input minus 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is the fourth integer read from the input minus 1, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `a[b] * (k + 1)`, `sm` is `a[s] * (k + 1)`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 0. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In natural language: The value of `b` is updated to `p[b] - 1`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
