Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is either -1 or the second integer read from the input minus 2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[previous_s] - 1`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`, `bm` is `max(a[b] * (k + 1), a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(a[s] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp)`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 1. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute the next part of the code.**
