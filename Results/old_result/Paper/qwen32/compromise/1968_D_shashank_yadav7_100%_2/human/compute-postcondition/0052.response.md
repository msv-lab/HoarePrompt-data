The only object in the loop head is the variable `i` and the loop iterates over the range `t`. Therefore, to adjust the state for the next iteration, we only need to increment `i` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, `sm`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted here.

Given that `i` is `min(n, initial_k)` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will simply be incremented by 1. The other variables will retain their values as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `min(n, initial_k) + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0 if the loop terminated early, otherwise `n - i`, `b` is the final value of `b` after all iterations, `s` is the final value of `s` after all iterations, `sp` is the cumulative sum of `a[s]` for all iterations, `bp` is the cumulative sum of `a[b]` for all iterations, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for all iterations, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for all iterations. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is strictly greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`**.
