The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Draw'`. The initial state describes various variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, `sm`) and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement itself. The `print` statement is simply outputting a static string.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:
- The `print` statement is `print('Draw')`.
- This statement does not reference any of the variables described in the initial state.

Given this, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward:

Output: **Draw**
