The code snippet `bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` updates the value of `bm` by comparing its current value with the expression `a[b] * k + bp` and assigning the larger of the two to `bm`.

Given the initial state, `bm` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `a[b] * k + bp`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged unless `k` is 0, in which case the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, but this does not affect the current line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`**.
