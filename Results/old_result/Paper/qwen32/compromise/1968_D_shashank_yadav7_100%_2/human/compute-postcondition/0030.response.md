The code snippet `sp += a[s]` increases the value of `sp` by the value of `a[s]`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 0
- `k` remains 0 if it was 0, otherwise `k` is decreased by 1
- `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`
- `s` is `p[s] - 1`
- `sp` is `2 * a[s]`
- `bp` is `2 * a[b]`
- `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`
- `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`

The value of `sp` is updated to `2 * a[s] + a[s]`, which simplifies to `3 * a[s]`.

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bp`, `bm`, `sm`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` remains 0 if it was 0, otherwise `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`**.
