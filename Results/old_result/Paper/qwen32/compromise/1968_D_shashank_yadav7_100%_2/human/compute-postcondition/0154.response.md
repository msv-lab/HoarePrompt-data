To determine the output state after all the executions of the loop, we need to consider the final values of all variables after all `t` test cases have been processed. Here's the breakdown of the output state:

1. **t**: This remains the same as the initial input integer representing the number of test cases.
2. **n, k, b, s, p, a**: These variables are re-initialized for each test case, so after all test cases, these variables will correspond to the last test case processed.
3. **i**: This variable represents the number of iterations the inner loop ran for the current test case. It will be reset for each test case.
4. **sp, bp, bm, sm**: These variables are cumulative and maximum trackers for the current test case. They will be reset for each test case.
5. **Output**: The result of each test case (either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') is printed immediately after processing each test case, so it does not accumulate in a variable but is part of the output for each test case.

Given this, the output state after all iterations will reflect the state after the last test case has been processed. Here is the output state in the required format:

Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is the number of elements in the permutation and array for the last test case, k is either 0 or the initial k minus the number of iterations, b is the final value of b after all iterations for the last test case, s is the final value of s after all iterations for the last test case, p is the permutation list for the last test case, a is the array list for the last test case, i is the number of iterations the inner loop ran for the last test case, sp is the cumulative sum of a[s] for the last test case, bp is the cumulative sum of a[b] for the last test case, bm is the maximum value of a[b] * k + bp for the last test case, sm is the maximum value of a[s] * k + sp for the last test case.**

In simpler terms, the output state after all iterations will reflect the final state of all variables as they were after processing the last test case.
