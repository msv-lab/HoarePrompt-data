Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, `b` is the final value of `b` after all iterations minus 1, `s` is the final value of `s` after all iterations minus 1, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` across all iterations, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` across all iterations, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `i` is `n` if the loop completes all iterations or the point where `k` becomes 0. Additionally, `bm` is greater than `sm`.**
