The code snippet reads four integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`. The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, `sm`, `p`, `a`, and `i` have specific states or conditions. After executing the code, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` will be updated with the values read from the input, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `b` is the third integer read from the input, `s` is the fourth integer read from the input, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` across all iterations, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` across all iterations, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
