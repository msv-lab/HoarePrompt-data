The code snippet `sp += a[s]` modifies the value of `sp` by adding `a[s]` to it. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `i` is 0
- `n` is greater than 0
- `k` is 0 if the condition `k == 0` was true, otherwise `k` remains `k - 1`
- `b` is `p[b] - 1`
- `s` is `p[s] - 1`
- `sp` is `a[s]`
- `bp` is `a[b]`
- `bm` is `max(a[b] * k, a[b] * k + bp)`
- `sm` is `max(a[p[s] - 1] * k, a[s] * k + sp)`

After executing the code `sp += a[s]`, the new value of `sp` will be `a[s] + a[s]`, which simplifies to `2 * a[s]`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0 if the condition `k == 0` was true, otherwise `k` remains `k - 1`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `max(a[b] * k, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(a[p[s] - 1] * k, a[s] * k + sp)`**

In natural language: The value of `sp` is now twice its original value, which is `2 * a[s]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
