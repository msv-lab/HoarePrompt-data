The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, a permutation `p` of length `n`, and an array `a` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates and compares the maximum possible values of two expressions involving elements from `a` and the permutation `p`, adjusted by `k`. It then prints "Bodya" if one expression is greater, "Sasha" if the other is greater, or "Draw" if they are equal.
