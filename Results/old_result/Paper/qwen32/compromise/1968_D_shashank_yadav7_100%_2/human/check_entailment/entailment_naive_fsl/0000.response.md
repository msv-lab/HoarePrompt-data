Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The provided code has a few issues that can cause it to not work correctly for all potential cases. Let's analyze the code and identify the problems:

1. **Initialization of Scores**:
   - The initial scores `bp` and `sp` are set to `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively. This is correct.
   - However, `bm` and `sm` are initialized to `a[b] * k` and `a[s] * k` respectively. This is incorrect because it assumes that the player will stay at the same position for all `k` turns, which is not necessarily the case.

2. **Updating Scores**:
   - Inside the loop, `bm` and `sm` are updated using the formula `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`. This is incorrect because it again assumes that the player will stay at the same position for the remaining `k` turns, which is not necessarily the case.
   - The scores `bp` and `sp` are correctly updated by adding `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively.

3. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition `for i in range(n)` is incorrect. It should be `for i in range(k)` because the game lasts exactly `k` turns.
   - The decrement of `k` inside the loop is not needed if the loop condition is corrected.

### Corrected Code:
Here is a corrected version of the code that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, b, s = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        bp = 0
        sp = 0
        for _ in range(k):
            bp += a[b]
            sp += a[s]
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

```

### Explanation of Correctness:
- The scores `bp` and `sp` are initialized to 0.
- The loop runs exactly `k` times, simulating each turn of the game.
- In each turn, the scores are updated by adding the value at the current position.
- The positions are updated by moving to `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` respectively.
- After `k` turns, the scores are compared to determine the winner.

This corrected code should work correctly for all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
