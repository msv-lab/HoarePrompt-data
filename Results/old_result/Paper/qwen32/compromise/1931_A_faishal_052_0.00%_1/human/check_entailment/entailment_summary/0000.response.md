### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to a given encoded integer `n`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and whether it meets the requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which is the encoded word.

2. **Generating the Word:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - It then enters a loop that runs twice. Inside the loop, it checks the value of `lex` (which is initially set to `n`):
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1 to `arr` and decrements `lex` by 1.
     - If `lex` is less than 52 but greater than 26, it appends 26 to `arr` and decrements `lex` by 26.
     - Otherwise, it appends 26 to `arr` and decrements `lex` by 26.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - The list `arr` is then sorted.
   - Finally, it converts each value in `arr` to the corresponding letter by adding 96 (since 'a' is 97 in ASCII) and prints the letters.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Logic for Generating Letters:**
   - The current logic does not guarantee that the letters will form the lexicographically smallest word. For example, if `n` is 24, the program might generate "aav" or "zaz" or any other combination, but not necessarily the smallest one ("aav").
   - The loop that runs twice and the conditional checks are not sufficient to ensure the smallest possible letters are chosen first.

2. **Sorting the Letters:**
   - Sorting the letters after generating them is not the correct approach to find the lexicographically smallest word. The letters should be chosen in such a way that they are the smallest possible from the start.

3. **Generating the Lexicographically Smallest Word:**
   - A better approach would be to start by assigning the smallest possible values to the first two letters and then assigning the remaining value to the third letter. This ensures that the word is lexicographically smallest.

### Correctness:

Given the above issues, the program does not correctly generate the lexicographically smallest word for each test case.

**Correctness: False**

To correct the program, the logic should be modified to ensure that the letters are chosen in ascending order, starting with the smallest possible values.
