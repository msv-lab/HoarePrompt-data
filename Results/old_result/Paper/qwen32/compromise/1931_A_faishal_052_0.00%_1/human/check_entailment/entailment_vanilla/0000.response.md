Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input:**
   - We have multiple test cases.
   - Each test case has a single integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78), representing the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, we need to output the lexicographically smallest word of 3 lowercase Latin letters that could sum up to `n`.

3. **Lexicographical Order:**
   - A word `a` is lexicographically smaller than a word `b` if in the first position where they differ, `a` has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in `b`.

### Program Analysis:
The program is structured to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it tries to construct the lexicographically smallest word by:
1. Reading the encoded integer `lex`.
2. Iteratively determining the values for the first two letters of the word.
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it assigns the smallest possible value (1, corresponding to 'a').
   - If `lex` is less than 52, it assigns the maximum possible value (26, corresponding to 'z') for the second letter.
   - Otherwise, it assigns the maximum possible value (26) for the second letter.
3. Assigns the remaining value to the third letter.
4. Sorts the three values to ensure the word is lexicographically smallest.
5. Converts the values to corresponding letters and prints them.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Letters:**
   - The logic for determining the values of the first two letters is flawed. The program does not correctly account for the remaining value after assigning values to the first two letters.
   - For example, if `lex` is 24, the program might incorrectly assign 26 and 26 to the first two letters, which is not valid since the sum would exceed 24.
   
2. **Sorting the Letters:**
   - Sorting the values after assigning them does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word. The values should be assigned in such a way that they form the smallest possible word from the beginning.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `lex` is 3, which should result in "aaa".

### Correct Approach:
To construct the lexicographically smallest word:
1. Start by assigning the smallest possible values to the first two letters.
2. Assign the remaining value to the third letter.
3. Ensure that the values are within the valid range (1 to 26).

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the program logic, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
