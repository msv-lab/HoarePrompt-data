Reasoning:
The program is designed to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that corresponds to a given encoded sum. The approach taken in the program is not optimal and contains logical errors that will lead to incorrect results for some test cases.

Here are the issues with the program:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Values Less Than 26**: The program checks if `lex` (the remaining sum to be encoded) is less than or equal to 26 and appends `1` to the array `arr` if true. This is incorrect because it should append the actual value of `lex` if it is less than or equal to 26, not `1`.
2. **Incorrect Handling of Values Greater Than 26**: The program checks if `lex` is less than 52 and appends `26` to the array `arr` if true. This is incorrect because it should append the maximum possible value (26) and then reduce `lex` by that amount. However, it does not handle the remaining value correctly.
3. **Sorting the Array**: The program sorts the array `arr` after appending the remaining value. Sorting is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results because the goal is to find the lexicographically smallest word, which means the smallest letters should come first.
4. **Appending the Remaining Value**: The program directly appends the remaining value of `lex` to the array `arr` after the loop. This can lead to incorrect results because it does not ensure that the values are distributed optimally among the three letters.

To fix the program, we need to ensure that we distribute the sum correctly among the three letters while maintaining the lexicographical order. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        arr = [1, 1, 1]  # Start with the smallest possible letters
        lex -= 3  # Subtract the initial sum of 'aaa'
        
        # Distribute the remaining sum among the three letters
        for j in range(3):
            if lex == 0:
                break
            diff = min(25, lex)  # We can add at most 25 to each letter
            arr[j] += diff
            lex -= diff
        
        # Print the resulting word
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
        print()

func()
```

Given the issues in the provided program, the original program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
