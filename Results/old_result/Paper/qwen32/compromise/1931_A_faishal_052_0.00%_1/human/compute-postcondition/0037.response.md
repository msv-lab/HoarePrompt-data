The code snippet sorts the array `arr`. Given the possible initial values of `arr`, we can determine the sorted order for each case:

1. If `arr` was `[1, 1, lex]`, after sorting, `arr` remains `[1, 1, lex]`.
2. If `arr` was `[26, 1, lex]`, after sorting, `arr` becomes `[1, 26, lex]`.
3. If `arr` was `[1, 26, lex]`, after sorting, `arr` remains `[1, 26, lex]`.
4. If `arr` was `[26, 26, lex]`, after sorting, `arr` remains `[26, 26, lex]`.

In all cases, the first element of `arr` will be either `1` or `26`, and the second element will be `26` if the initial `arr` contained two `26`s or if `26` was originally the second element. The third element will be `lex`.

The values of `t`, `cases`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by the sorting operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `arr` is either [1, 1, lex], [1, 26, lex], or [26, 26, lex], and `lex` has been adjusted based on its initial value and is now either `lex - 2` if the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, or `lex - 27` if the initial `lex` was greater than 26 but less than 52, or `lex - 52` if the initial `lex` was 52 or greater.**
