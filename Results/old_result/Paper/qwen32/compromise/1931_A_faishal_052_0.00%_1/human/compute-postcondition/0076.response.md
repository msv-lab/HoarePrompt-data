Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `lex` is adjusted based on its original value minus 26, and `arr` is either [1, 1, 26], [26, 1, 26], [26, 1, 26], [26, 26, 26], [1, 26, 26], or [26, 26, 26] depending on its original value.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is reduced by 26. The values of `t`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
