Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Variables and Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
   - `cases` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `k` is 1.
   - `arr` is `[1, 1, 1]` if `lex` is 1, or `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` is 26.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   - `print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')`

3. **Analysis:**
   - The value of `k` is 1.
   - The value of `arr` depends on the value of `lex`.
     - If `lex` is 1, `arr` is `[1, 1, 1]`.
     - If `lex` is 26, `arr` is `[1, 26, 26]`.
   - In either case, `arr[k]` (which is `arr[1]`) will be 1 if `lex` is 1, and 26 if `lex` is 26.
   - The `chr()` function converts an integer to its corresponding ASCII character.
     - If `arr[k]` is 1, `chr(arr[k] + 96)` will be `chr(1 + 96)` which is `chr(97)` resulting in 'a'.
     - If `arr[k]` is 26, `chr(arr[k] + 96)` will be `chr(26 + 96)` which is `chr(122)` resulting in 'z'.

4. **Output:**
   - The output will be either 'a' or 'z' depending on the value of `lex`.
   - Since the exact value of `lex` is not provided, we describe the output in terms of `lex`.

Final Answer:
Output: **'a' if lex is 1, 'z' if lex is 26**
