The code appends the value `1` to the list `arr`. Given the initial conditions, `arr` can be either `[1]` or `[26]`. After appending `1`, `arr` will become `[1, 1]` if it was initially `[1]`, or `[26, 1]` if it was initially `[26]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, and `arr` is either [1, 1] or [26, 1]. If `lex` is an integer such that 0 <= lex <= 25, `arr` is [1, 1]. If `lex` is an integer greater than 25, `arr` is [26, 1] and `lex` remains unchanged.**
