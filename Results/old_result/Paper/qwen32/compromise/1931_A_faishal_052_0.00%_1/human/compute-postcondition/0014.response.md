The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. Since `lex` is initially an input integer greater than 52, after the operation, `lex` will still be greater than 26. The values of the other variables (`t`, `cases`, `i`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is [26], and `lex` is an input integer greater than 26.**
