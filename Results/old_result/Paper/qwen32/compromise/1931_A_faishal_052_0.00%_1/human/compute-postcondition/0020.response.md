The code snippet `arr.append(26)` adds the integer 26 to the end of the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `arr` can either be `[1]` or `[26]`. After appending 26, the possible states for `arr` are `[1, 26]` or `[26, 26]`.

Other variables (`t`, `cases`, `i`, `lex`, `j`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is either [1, 26] or [26, 26], `lex` has been adjusted based on its initial value, `j` is 0**.
