Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `arr` is either `[1, 26]` or `[26, 26]`, and `lex` is either `lex - 27` or `lex - 52`.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is reduced by 26. Initially, `lex` could be either `lex - 1` or `lex - 26`. After the operation, `lex` becomes `lex - 27` or `lex - 52`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
