Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `k` is 3. If `lex` was originally less than or equal to 26, `arr` is [1] and `lex` is now `lex` minus 1. If `lex` was originally greater than 26 but less than 52, `arr` is [26] and `lex` is now `lex` minus 26. If `lex` was originally 52 or greater, `arr` is [26] and `lex` is now `lex` minus 26.**
