The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than 3. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 0, then 1, and now it is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 3, but since the loop condition is `k in range(3)`, the loop will terminate when `k` is 3.

However, to describe the state right before the loop terminates (i.e., at the start of what would be the next iteration if it were to continue), we set `k` to 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `arr` is either [1, 1, lex], [1, lex, 26], or [lex, 26, 26] where `lex` is adjusted to be between 1 and 26**
