The code snippet `lex = lex - 1` directly decrements the value of `lex` by 1. 

Given that `lex` was previously adjusted to either `lex - 1` (if the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26) or `lex - 26` (if the initial `lex` was greater than 26), we need to consider these two scenarios:

1. If the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, then `lex` was adjusted to `lex - 1`. After the current operation, `lex` becomes `lex - 2`.
2. If the initial `lex` was greater than 26, then `lex` was adjusted to `lex - 26`. After the current operation, `lex` becomes `lex - 27`.

Since the exact initial value of `lex` is not specified, we can only describe the output state in terms of the adjusted `lex` value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is either [1, 1, 1], [26, 1, 1], [1, 26, 1], or [26, 26, 1], `lex` is either `lex - 2` if the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, or `lex - 27` if the initial `lex` was greater than 26, and `j` is 1.**
