The code snippet `arr.append(26)` appends the value 26 to the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `arr` can be either `[1]` or `[26]` based on the value of `lex`. After appending 26, `arr` will be either `[1, 26]` or `[26, 26]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `arr` is either `[1, 26]` or `[26, 26]`, and `lex` is either `lex - 1` or `lex - 26`.**
