The code snippet `lex = lex - 1` decrements the value of `lex` by 1. Given that `lex` is an input integer and `lex` is less than or equal to 26, after the decrement, `lex` will be an integer such that 0 <= lex <= 25.

The values of the other variables (`t`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 3, `arr` is [1], `lex` is an integer such that 0 <= lex <= 25.**
