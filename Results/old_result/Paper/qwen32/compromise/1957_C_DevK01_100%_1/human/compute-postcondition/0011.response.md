The given initial state is a list `[1, 888285363]`. The code snippet `return dp[-1]` attempts to return the last element of the list `dp`. However, in the initial state provided, the list is named as `[1, 888285363]` and not `dp`. Assuming `dp` is a typo and should be the list provided, the last element of the list `[1, 888285363]` is `888285363`.

Output State: **The program returns 888285363**
