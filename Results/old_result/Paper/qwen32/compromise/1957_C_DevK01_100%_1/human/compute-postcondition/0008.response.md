To determine the output state, we need to execute the given line of code with the provided initial state. Let's break down the code:

The line of code is:
```python
dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]
```

Given the initial state:
- `dp` is a list with the values `[5, 9]`
- `i` is `4`

Let's calculate the new value to be appended to `dp`:
- `dp[-1]` is the last element of `dp`, which is `9`.
- `dp[-2]` is the second last element of `dp`, which is `5`.
- `i` is `4`.

Now, let's substitute these values into the expression:
```python
(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)
```
This becomes:
```python
(9 + 2 * (4 - 1) * 5) % (7 + 10 ** 9)
```
Simplifying inside the parentheses:
```python
(9 + 2 * 3 * 5) % (7 + 10 ** 9)
```
Further simplification:
```python
(9 + 30) % (7 + 10 ** 9)
```
Which is:
```python
39 % (7 + 10 ** 9)
```
Since `7 + 10 ** 9` is a very large number, `39 % (7 + 10 ** 9)` is simply `39`.

So, the new value to be appended to `dp` is `39`. The list `dp` will now be `[5, 9, 39]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be at least 4, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n, each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, representing the i-th move, where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid, `dp` is a list with the values [5, 9, 39], `i` is 4**
