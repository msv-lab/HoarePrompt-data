Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Modulo Operation Error**: The modulo operation in the `func_1` function is incorrect. The modulo should be `10**9 + 7` instead of `7 + 10**9`.

2. **Function Call Before Definition**: The function `func_1` is called before it is defined, which will result in a `NameError`.

3. **Logic for Remaining Moves**: The logic for reducing `n` based on the moves is correct in principle, but the program does not handle the case where `n` becomes negative, which should not happen as the number of remaining positions cannot be negative.

4. **Handling of `n`**: The program reduces `n` by 2 for each non-diagonal move and by 1 for each diagonal move, which correctly accounts for the positions taken by the rooks and their mirrored counterparts. However, the program does not handle the scenario where all positions are filled correctly, and it should ensure that `n` does not drop below 0.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    dp = [1, 1]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp.append((dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % MOD)
        dp.pop(0)
    return dp[-1]

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (n, k) = (L[0], L[1])
    for j in range(k):
        L1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        (a, b) = (L1[0], L1[1])
        if a != b:
            n -= 2
        else:
            n -= 1
    if n < 0:
        n = 0
    print(func_1(n))
```

This corrected version fixes the modulo operation, ensures the function is defined before it is called, and handles the case where `n` might become negative.
