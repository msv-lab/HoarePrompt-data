Let's analyze the problem and the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem involves a game on an \( n \times n \) chessboard where rooks are placed such that no two rooks attack each other (i.e., no two rooks can be in the same row or column). The player and the computer take turns placing rooks, with the computer mirroring the player's move unless the move is on the main diagonal, in which case the computer skips its turn.

The task is to determine the number of different final configurations of rooks on the board after \( k \) moves by the player and the corresponding computer moves.

### Key Points
1. **Initial Moves**: The player has already made \( k \) moves, and the computer has mirrored these moves where possible.
2. **Remaining Moves**: After the initial \( k \) moves, we need to determine the number of ways to place the remaining rooks.
3. **Constraints**: The board size \( n \) can be up to \( 3 \cdot 10^5 \), and the total number of test cases \( t \) can be up to \( 10^4 \).

### Program Analysis
The provided program reads the input and processes each test case as follows:
1. **Reading Input**: It reads the number of test cases \( t \). For each test case, it reads the board size \( n \) and the number of moves \( k \).
2. **Processing Moves**: For each of the \( k \) moves, it reads the row and column \( (a, b) \) and adjusts the board size \( n \) based on whether the move is on the main diagonal or not:
   - If \( a \neq b \), both the player and the computer place a rook, reducing \( n \) by 2.
   - If \( a = b \), only the player places a rook, reducing \( n \) by 1.
3. **Calculating Configurations**: After processing the \( k \) moves, it calls `func_1(n)` to compute the number of possible final configurations for the remaining board size \( n \).
4. **Dynamic Programming in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to place rooks on an \( n \times n \) board.
   - It initializes a list `dp` with the base cases `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 1`.
   - It then iterates from 2 to \( n \), updating the `dp` list using the formula:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i - 1) \cdot dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - The function returns `dp[-1]`, which is the number of configurations for an \( n \times n \) board.

### Correctness Check
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
2. **Board Size Adjustment**: The logic for adjusting the board size \( n \) based on the moves is correct:
   - If \( a \neq b \), both the player and the computer place rooks, reducing \( n \) by 2.
   - If \( a = b \), only the player places a rook, reducing \( n \) by 1.
3. **Dynamic Programming Formula**: The formula used in `func_1` is correct for computing the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on an \( n \times n \) board. The formula accounts for the fact that each new rook can be placed in any of the remaining rows and columns that are not already occupied, and it correctly handles the constraints of the problem.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It correctly handles the input, processes the moves, and uses dynamic programming to compute the number of possible final configurations.

**Correctness: True**
