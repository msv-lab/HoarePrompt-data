Reasoning:  
The provided program has a key issue in the `func_1` function, which is supposed to compute the number of different final configurations of the chessboard given the remaining number of positions `n` where rooks can be placed. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly compute this value. Instead, it always returns the same number, 888285363, regardless of the input `n`. This is evident from the execution summary provided, which states that `func_1(n)` returns 888285363 for any `n`.

The correct approach to solve this problem involves calculating the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining positions of the chessboard without any two rooks attacking each other. This is a combinatorial problem that can be solved using dynamic programming or combinatorial mathematics. The current implementation of `func_1` does not reflect this logic and thus is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
