Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description. There are several issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Moves**: The code incorrectly calculates the remaining moves by subtracting 2 from `n` when `a != b` and 1 when `a == b`. However, the actual number of available positions on the chessboard is not correctly tracked. It should consider the number of unoccupied rows and columns.

2. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation in the `func_1` function uses `7 + 10 ** 9` instead of `10 ** 9 + 7`. This is a typo and should be corrected.

3. **Dynamic Programming Function**: The `func_1` function is supposed to calculate the number of possible configurations based on the remaining number of unoccupied rows and columns. However, the logic inside `func_1` does not accurately reflect the combinatorial nature of placing rooks without attacks. The current implementation does not correctly compute the number of ways to place rooks on a chessboard given the constraints.

4. **Handling of Test Cases**: The main loop processes each test case, but the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code. Even if `func_1` were defined correctly, the logic for reducing `n` is flawed.

To correctly solve the problem, one needs to:
- Track which rows and columns are occupied.
- Use combinatorial mathematics to determine the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining unoccupied rows and columns.
- Ensure the modulo operation is correctly applied.

Here is an example case where the current code fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4 1
1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
The code will likely produce an incorrect result due to the incorrect logic in reducing `n` and the flawed `func_1` function.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
