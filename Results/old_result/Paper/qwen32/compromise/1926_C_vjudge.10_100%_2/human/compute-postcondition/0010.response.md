The code snippet `sum_value_digits += int(x)` increments the variable `sum_value_digits` by the integer value of `x`. Given the initial state, `sum_value_digits` was `2 * int(x)`. After the code execution, `sum_value_digits` becomes the previous value plus `int(x)`, which means `sum_value_digits` is now `3 * int(x)`.

The other variables (`t`, `inf`, `values`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is 2, `sum_value_digits` is `3 * int(x)`**.
