To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the `values` list.

The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = 200000` (since `inf` is 200001 and the range function is exclusive of the end value). For each `i`, it calculates the sum of the digits of `i` and adds this sum to the previous value in the `values` list.

Let's break down the loop's behavior:

1. **Initialization**: `values` is a list of 200001 zeros.
2. **Iteration**:
   - For `i = 1`, `sum_value_digits` is 1 (since `1` has one digit which is `1`).
   - For `i = 2`, `sum_value_digits` is 2 (since `2` has one digit which is `2`).
   - For `i = 3`, `sum_value_digits` is 3 (since `3` has one digit which is `3`).
   - This continues up to `i = 9`, where `sum_value_digits` is 9.
   - For `i = 10`, `sum_value_digits` is 1 (since `1 + 0 = 1`).
   - For `i = 11`, `sum_value_digits` is 2 (since `1 + 1 = 2`).
   - This pattern continues up to `i = 200000`.

Each `values[i]` is the sum of `values[i-1]` and the sum of the digits of `i`.

Given the initial state and the first three iterations, we can infer that:
- `values[1]` will be `t` (as given in the first output state).
- `values[2]` will be `t + 2` (since the sum of digits of `2` is `2`).
- `values[3]` will be `t + 2 + 3` (since the sum of digits of `3` is `3`).

Continuing this pattern, `values[i]` will be the cumulative sum of `t` plus the sum of the digits of all numbers from `1` to `i`.

After all iterations (i.e., `i` from `1` to `200000`), `values[200000]` will be `t` plus the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from `1` to `200000`.

The final output state will be:
- `t` remains the input integer representing the number of test cases.
- `inf` remains 200001.
- `values` will have been updated such that `values[200000]` is `t` plus the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from `1` to `200000`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[200000]` which is `t` plus the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from `1` to `200000`.**
