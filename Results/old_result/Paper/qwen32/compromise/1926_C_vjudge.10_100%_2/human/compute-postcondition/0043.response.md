To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the provided information and the loop's behavior.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t`: Number of test cases (input integer).
- `inf`: Constant value set to 200001.
- `values`: A list of 200001 zeros, except `values[200000]` is `t` plus the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from `1` to `200000`.

### Loop Behavior:
The loop runs `t` times. Each iteration:
1. Reads an integer input `value`.
2. Prints `values[value]`.

### Output State After Iterations:
- **After 1 iteration**: `t` is at least 1, and `values[value]` is printed for the first input.
- **After 2 iterations**: `t` is at least 2, and `values[value]` is printed for the second input.
- **After 3 iterations**: `t` is at least 3, and `values[value]` is printed for the third input.

### Final Output State:
After the loop has executed all `t` iterations:
- The loop variable `_` will have completed its range of `t`.
- `t` remains unchanged as it is the number of test cases.
- `inf` remains 200001.
- `values` remains unchanged as it is only read from, not modified.
- The loop will have printed `values[value]` for each of the `t` input values.

The final state of the variables that are not part of the loop's head and body remains the same as the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The output state after all iterations is:
- `t`: The initial number of test cases.
- `inf`: 200001.
- `values`: A list of 200001 zeros except `values[200000]` is `t` plus the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from `1` to `200000`.

Output State: **`t` is the initial number of test cases, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[200000]` which is `t` plus the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from `1` to `200000`.**
