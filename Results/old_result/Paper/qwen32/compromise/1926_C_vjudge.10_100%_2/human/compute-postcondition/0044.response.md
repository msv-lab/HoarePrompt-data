Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each of the next `t` lines, it accepts a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the largest number Vladislav writes for each test case. The function returns the results for each test case based on the value of `n`.**
