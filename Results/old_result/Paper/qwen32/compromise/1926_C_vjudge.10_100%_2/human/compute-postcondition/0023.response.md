The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `inf`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `inf`. If `i` is less than `inf`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 200001 and `inf` is 200001. Since `i` is not less than `inf`, the loop would not execute again with these values. To make the loop execute one more time, `i` should be less than `inf`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to a value that is less than `inf`. 

Given that `inf` is 200001, we can set `i` to 200000 to allow the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[1]` which is `t` and `values[200001]` which is `sum_value_digits`, `i` is 200000, `sum_value_digits` is `final_sum_value_digits`**
