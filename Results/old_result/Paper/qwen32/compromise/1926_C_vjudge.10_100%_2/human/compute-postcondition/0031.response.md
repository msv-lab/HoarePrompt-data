Let's analyze the loop and the given output states to determine the final state after all iterations.

The loop iterates over the digits of the variable `i`, which is initially set to 200000. The loop converts each digit of `i` to an integer and adds it to `sum_value_digits`. 

Here are the steps:
1. **First iteration**: The first digit of `i` (200000) is '2'. So, `sum_value_digits` becomes `2`.
2. **Second iteration**: The second digit of `i` (200000) is '0'. So, `sum_value_digits` becomes `2 + 0 = 2`.
3. **Third iteration**: The third digit of `i` (200000) is '0'. So, `sum_value_digits` remains `2 + 0 = 2`.
4. **Fourth iteration**: The fourth digit of `i` (200000) is '0'. So, `sum_value_digits` remains `2 + 0 = 2`.
5. **Fifth iteration**: The fifth digit of `i` (200000) is '0'. So, `sum_value_digits` remains `2 + 0 = 2`.
6. **Sixth iteration**: The sixth digit of `i` (200000) is '0'. So, `sum_value_digits` remains `2 + 0 = 2`.

After the sixth iteration, all digits of `i` have been processed. Therefore, the final value of `sum_value_digits` is `2`.

The other variables (`t`, `inf`, `values`, `i`, and `final_sum_value_digits`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[1]` which is `t` and `values[200001]` which is `final_sum_value_digits`, `i` is 200000, `sum_value_digits` is 2.**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop, `sum_value_digits` is 2, and all other variables remain in their initial states as described.
