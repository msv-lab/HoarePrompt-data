The code snippet provided increments the variable `sum_value_digits` by the integer value of `x`. Given the initial state, the value of `sum_value_digits` is `int(x)`, and it will now be `int(x) + int(x)`, which simplifies to `2 * int(x)`.

The other variables (`t`, `inf`, `values`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[1]` which is `t`, `i` is 2, `sum_value_digits` is `2 * int(x)`**.
