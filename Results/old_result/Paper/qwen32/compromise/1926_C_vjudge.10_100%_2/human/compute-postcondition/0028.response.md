The code snippet `sum_value_digits += int(x)` increments the value of `sum_value_digits` by the integer value of `x`. Given that `x` is '2', `int(x)` evaluates to 2. Therefore, `sum_value_digits` is incremented by 2.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[1]` which is `t` and `values[200001]` which is `final_sum_value_digits`, `i` is 200000, `sum_value_digits` is 4, `x` is '2'**.
