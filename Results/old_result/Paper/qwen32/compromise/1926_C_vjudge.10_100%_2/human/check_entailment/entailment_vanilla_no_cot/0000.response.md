Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly calculates the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to n for multiple test cases. Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. The program first defines a function `func_1()` which is then called.
2. It initializes an array `values` of size `inf` (set to `2 * 10 ** 5 + 1` to accommodate the maximum possible value of `n`).
3. It then iterates through each number from 1 to `inf - 1`, calculates the sum of its digits, and stores the cumulative sum in the `values` array.
4. For each test case, it reads the input `n`, and then outputs the precomputed cumulative sum of the digits up to `n` from the `values` array.

This approach ensures that the program can handle up to 10^4 test cases efficiently, with each test case being answered in constant time O(1) after the initial O(n) preprocessing step. Given the constraints, this is a valid and efficient solution.
