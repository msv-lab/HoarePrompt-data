The `break` statement exits the loop or the nearest enclosing loop construct, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `num`, `counter`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers with at least one element. If the current element `num[i]` is equal to `'0'`, `counter` is set to 1. Otherwise, `counter` remains 0. `i` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
