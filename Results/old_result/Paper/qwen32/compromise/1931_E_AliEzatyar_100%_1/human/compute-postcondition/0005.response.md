The code snippet contains a `break` statement, which exits the innermost loop or switch construct. However, since there is no loop or switch construct provided in the context, the `break` statement will not have any effect on the variables `num` or `counter`. The values of `num` and `counter` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is a list of integers with at least one element, `counter` is 0, and the element at index `i` in `num` is not equal to `'0'`.**
