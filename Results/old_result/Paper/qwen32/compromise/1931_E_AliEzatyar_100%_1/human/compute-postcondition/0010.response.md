Postcondition: **`num` is a list of integers with at least one element. If the current element `num[i]` is equal to `'0'`, `counter` is set to 1 or 2, otherwise `counter` remains 0. `i` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `num[i]` is not equal to `'0'`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
