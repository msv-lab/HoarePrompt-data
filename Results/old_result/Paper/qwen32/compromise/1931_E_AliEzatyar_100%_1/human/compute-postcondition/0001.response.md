The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `len(num) - 1`. To ensure the loop executes, `len(num) - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0, which means `len(num)` must be at least 1. The variable `i` is initialized to `len(num) - 1` and will decrement with each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `num` must contain at least one element.

The state of `num` before the loop starts must be adjusted to ensure it has at least one element. The initial value of `counter` does not affect the execution of the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted in the context of ensuring the loop runs.

State: **`num` is a list of integers with at least one element, `counter` is 0**
