You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
- Monocarp needs at least 2 friends at his party.
- Friend `i` will attend the party if both `i` and `p_i` (the best friend of `i`) receive invitations.
- The task is to find the minimum number of invitations needed such that at least 2 friends attend the party.

### Program Analysis:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the list of best friends and checking if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (`q == i + 1`). If such a pair is found, it prints `2` as the minimum number of invitations needed. If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

### Issues and Correctness:
1. **Checking for Mutual Best Friends**:
   - The program correctly checks for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends (`q == i + 1`). If such a pair is found, it correctly concludes that only 2 invitations are needed.

2. **Handling Cases Without Mutual Best Friends**:
   - If no mutual best friends are found, the program assumes that 3 invitations are needed. However, this is not always correct. There may be cases where 2 invitations are still sufficient, but they are not mutual best friends. For example, in a cycle of 4 friends (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1), inviting friends 1 and 2 would result in friends 2 and 3 attending, which only requires 2 invitations.

3. **General Case Handling**:
   - The program does not handle all possible cases correctly. It assumes that if no mutual best friends are found, 3 invitations are always needed. However, this is not always the case, as shown in the example above.

### Correctness Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly handle all possible cases. Specifically, it does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations needed when no mutual best friends are present. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
