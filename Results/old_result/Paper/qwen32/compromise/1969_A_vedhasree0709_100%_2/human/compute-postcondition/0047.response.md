Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is at least 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 1; `p` is `l[0]`; `q` is `l[l[0] - 1]`. If `q` equals `i + 1`, then `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.**

The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
