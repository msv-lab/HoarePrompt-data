To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `i` and `n`.

The loop condition is `i <= n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is at least 2. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`.

Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 3 (because `2 <= 3 - 1` is true).

No other states need to be adjusted as they do not affect the loop condition directly.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is at least 3; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 2; `p` is `l[1]`; `q` is `l[p - 1]`. If `q` equals `i + 1`, then `j` is 1; otherwise, `j` remains 0.**
