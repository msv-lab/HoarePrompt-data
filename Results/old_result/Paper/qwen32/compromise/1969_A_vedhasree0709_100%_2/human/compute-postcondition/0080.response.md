Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 4999; `n` is at least 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 1 if `q` is equal to `i + 1`, otherwise `j` remains 0; `p` is the first element of `l`; `q` is the element at index `p - 1` in `l`. If `q` is equal to `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
