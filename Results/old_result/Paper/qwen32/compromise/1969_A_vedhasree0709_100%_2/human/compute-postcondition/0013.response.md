The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `p`, `q`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 1; `p` is `l[0]`; `q` is `l[l[0] - 1]`. If `q` equals `i + 1`, then `j` is 1. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 1; `p` is `l[0]`; `q` is `l[l[0] - 1]`. If `q` equals `i + 1`, then `j` is 1. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.**
