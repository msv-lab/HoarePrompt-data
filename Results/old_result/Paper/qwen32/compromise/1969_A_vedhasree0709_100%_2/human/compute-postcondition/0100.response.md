The given code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `3`. The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, and `j`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value printed is solely determined by the `print(3)` statement itself.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print(3)`.
2. The number `3` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.
3. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `j`) are used in this `print` statement.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the number `3`.

Output: **3**
