Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
- `n` is at least 3.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `i` is 2.
- `p` is `l[2]`.
- `q` is `l[l[2] - 1]`.
- If `q` equals `i + 1`, then `j` is 1; otherwise, `j` remains 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `2`. The value to be printed is explicitly given as `2` and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `p`, `q`, or `j` does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

### Output:
The code will print the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
