Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 0 <= t <= 4999. `n` remains the input integer. `l` remains the list of integers obtained from the input. `i` is equal to `n` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, or the value when `q == i + 1` if the loop breaks early. `j` is `0` indicating that the loop did not break due to `q == i + 1`.**
