Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is at least 2; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 1; `p` is `l[1]`; `q` is `l[l[1] - 1]`; `j` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `p`, `q`, and `j` remain unchanged. The code simply breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it is in.
