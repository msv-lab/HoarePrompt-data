The given code snippet only changes the value of the variable `j`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `j` is initially 0, the code `j = 1` sets `j` to 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `p` is `l[0]`; `q` is `l[l[0] - 1]`; `q` equals `i + 1`**
