Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum sum for the matrix and does not follow the correct sequence of operations to achieve this sum. Let's break down why:

1. **Matrix Initialization**: The program initializes the matrix with each row being a permutation from 1 to n. However, it does not actually perform any operations to maximize the sum.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum calculation `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` does not correctly compute the maximum possible sum of the matrix. The maximum sum can be achieved by filling the matrix with the highest possible values in a strategic way.

3. **Operations**: The operations printed in the loop do not contribute to maximizing the sum in the way described in the problem statement. The operations should strategically fill the matrix to maximize the sum.

To achieve the maximum sum, the strategy is to fill the matrix with the highest possible values in such a way that each row and column is filled with a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. The optimal way to do this is to fill the matrix diagonally, ensuring that each row and column contains unique values from 1 to n.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        res = n * (n * n + 1) // 2
        print(res, n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print('1', i, *range(1, n + 1))

func()
```

In this corrected version:
- The maximum sum `res` is calculated as `n * (n * n + 1) // 2`, which is the sum of the first `n^2` natural numbers.
- We perform exactly `n` operations, each of type 1, to fill each row with the permutation from 1 to n. This ensures that each row and column has unique values from 1 to n, maximizing the sum.
