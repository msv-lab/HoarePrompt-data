### Reasoning:

The task is to maximize the sum of all the numbers in an `n x n` matrix by performing a series of operations, with the constraint that the number of operations should not exceed `2n`.

The solution approach provided in the annotated program is as follows:
1. For each test case, it initializes an `n x n` matrix `mat` with the first row filled with `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
2. It calculates the sum `res` using the formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.
3. It prints `res` and the number of operations `2 * n`.
4. It then prints `2 * n` operations, where each operation is either of type 1 or type 2, affecting a specific row or column of the matrix.

Let's analyze the correctness of this approach:

- The formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` is used to calculate the sum `res`. This formula does not directly relate to the maximum sum achievable in the matrix. Instead, it seems to be an arbitrary calculation that does not ensure the maximum sum.
- The operations printed in the loop do not guarantee that the matrix will be filled in a way that maximizes the sum. Specifically, the operations seem to be filling the matrix with the same permutation repeatedly without ensuring that the maximum possible values are placed in the matrix.

The optimal strategy to maximize the sum is to fill the matrix with the maximum possible values in each row and column, ensuring that each number from 1 to `n` appears exactly once in each row and column. This can be achieved by using a Latin square, where each number from 1 to `n` appears exactly once in each row and each column.

However, the provided program does not follow this strategy. Instead, it uses a fixed permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` for each row and column, which does not necessarily lead to the maximum sum.

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix based on the problem description and the operations allowed. It uses an arbitrary formula for the sum and a fixed permutation for the operations, which do not ensure the maximum possible sum.
