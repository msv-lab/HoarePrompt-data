Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to maximize the sum of all elements in an `n x n` matrix filled with zeros using up to `2n` operations. Two types of operations are allowed:
1. Type 1: Choose a row `i` and fill it with a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`.
2. Type 2: Choose a column `i` and fill it with a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`.

The goal is to maximize the sum of the matrix elements and provide a sequence of operations that achieve this sum with no more than `2n` operations.

### Program Analysis

Here's the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
        res = 0
        for i in range(n):
            res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
        print(res, n << 1)
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):
            print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
            print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break down the program:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Matrix Initialization:**
   - It initializes a matrix `mat` of size `n x n` with each row filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

3. **Sum Calculation:**
   - It calculates the sum `res` using the formula `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - This formula seems to be intended to calculate the maximum possible sum of the matrix after applying the operations optimally.

4. **Output:**
   - It prints the maximum sum `res` and the number of operations `n << 1` (which is equivalent to `2 * n`).
   - It then prints `2n` operations: for each row `i` from `n` to `1`, it performs a Type 1 operation and a Type 2 operation, both using the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Correctness Verification

#### Sum Calculation:
- The formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` does not directly correspond to the maximum sum of the matrix. The maximum sum should be `n * (n^2 + n) / 2` because each row or column filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` will contribute `n * (n + 1) / 2` to the sum, and there are `n` rows and `n` columns.
- The correct formula for the maximum sum should be `n * n * (n + 1) / 2` (since each element in the matrix will be filled with a value from `1` to `n` exactly once).

#### Operations:
- The operations performed by the program are correct in terms of the constraints (no more than `2n` operations). However, the way the sum is calculated is incorrect.
- The program fills each row and each column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`, which is a valid approach but the sum calculation is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The program's operations are valid but the sum calculation is incorrect. Therefore, the program is not correct based on the problem's requirements.

**Correctness: False**
