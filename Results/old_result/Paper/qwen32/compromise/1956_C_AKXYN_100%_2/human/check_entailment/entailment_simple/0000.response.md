### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem by maximizing the sum of all elements in the matrix using a limited number of operations (no more than 2n operations). Let's break down the program logic:

1. **Matrix Initialization**: The program initializes an `n x n` matrix `mat` where each row `i` is set to the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This is done using a list comprehension that creates `n` rows, each containing the numbers from 1 to `n`.

2. **Calculating the Result (`res`)**: The variable `res` is calculated as the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`. This formula is derived from the fact that the maximum sum can be achieved by having the `i-th` row (or column) filled with the numbers from `i+1` to `n` in ascending order.

3. **Printing the Result and Operations**:
   - It prints the result `res` and the number of operations `2 * n`.
   - It then prints `2 * n` operations, where each operation is either of type 1 or type 2. Specifically, for each `i` from `n` to `1`, it performs two operations:
     - A type 1 operation on row `i` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
     - A type 2 operation on column `i` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

4. **Correctness of Operations**:
   - The operations described in the program ensure that each row and each column of the matrix is filled with the numbers from `1` to `n` in ascending order.
   - The sum of the matrix elements is maximized because each element in the matrix is set to the largest possible value it can be, given the constraints of the problem.

5. **Maximum Sum Calculation**:
   - The formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` is used to calculate the maximum sum. This formula is derived from the fact that the sum of the first `n` natural numbers is `n * (n + 1) / 2`, and the sum of the squares of the first `n` natural numbers is `n * (n + 1) * (2n + 1) / 6`. The provided formula is a simplified form that gives the correct maximum sum for the problem.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix and provides a valid sequence of operations to achieve this sum. The number of operations is within the allowed limit of `2n`.

**Correctness: True**
