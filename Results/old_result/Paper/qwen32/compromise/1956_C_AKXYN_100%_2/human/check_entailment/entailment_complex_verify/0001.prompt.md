You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves an integer `n` representing the size of an `n x n` matrix. For each test case, it calculates a specific result `res` based on the formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` summed over all `i` from `0` to `n-1`. It then prints this result along with `2 * n`. Following this, it outputs a series of commands involving the matrix rows, printing each row twice with different labels ('1' and '2'). The final output for each test case includes the calculated result and the series of commands for the last test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to maximize the sum of all elements in an `n x n` matrix filled with zeros using up to `2n` operations. Two types of operations are allowed:
1. Type 1: Choose a row `i` and fill it with a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`.
2. Type 2: Choose a column `i` and fill it with a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`.

The goal is to maximize the sum of the matrix elements and provide a sequence of operations that achieve this sum with no more than `2n` operations.

### Program Analysis

Here's the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
        res = 0
        for i in range(n):
            res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
        print(res, n << 1)
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):
            print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
            print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break down the program:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Matrix Initialization:**
   - It initializes a matrix `mat` of size `n x n` with each row filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

3. **Sum Calculation:**
   - It calculates the sum `res` using the formula `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - This formula seems to be intended to calculate the maximum possible sum of the matrix after applying the operations optimally.

4. **Output:**
   - It prints the maximum sum `res` and the number of operations `n << 1` (which is equivalent to `2 * n`).
   - It then prints `2n` operations: for each row `i` from `n` to `1`, it performs a Type 1 operation and a Type 2 operation, both using the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Correctness Verification

#### Sum Calculation:
- The formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` does not directly correspond to the maximum sum of the matrix. The maximum sum should be `n * (n^2 + n) / 2` because each row or column filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` will contribute `n * (n + 1) / 2` to the sum, and there are `n` rows and `n` columns.
- The correct formula for the maximum sum should be `n * n * (n + 1) / 2` (since each element in the matrix will be filled with a value from `1` to `n` exactly once).

#### Operations:
- The operations performed by the program are correct in terms of the constraints (no more than `2n` operations). However, the way the sum is calculated is incorrect.
- The program fills each row and each column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`, which is a valid approach but the sum calculation is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The program's operations are valid but the sum calculation is incorrect. Therefore, the program is not correct based on the problem's requirements.
