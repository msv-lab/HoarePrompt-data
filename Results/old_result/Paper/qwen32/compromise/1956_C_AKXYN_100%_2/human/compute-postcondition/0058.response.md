To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the provided initial state and the code snippet.

**Initial State:**
- `t` must be greater than or equal to 1 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it's part of the initial state).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `mat` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`. (This variable is not used in the print statement, so it's irrelevant for this specific print statement.)
- `res` is the sum of the series \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \cdot (2i + 1)\). (This variable is not used in the print statement, so it's irrelevant for this specific print statement.)
- `i` is `n`.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

**Explanation:**
- The `%d` in the string `'2 %d'` is a placeholder for an integer, which will be replaced by the value of `i`.
- `i` is given as `n` in the initial state.
- `*range(1, n + 1)` will unpack a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

**Steps to Determine Output:**
1. Substitute `i` with `n` in the string `'2 %d'`, resulting in `'2 n'` where `n` is the value of `n`.
2. The `*range(1, n + 1)` will generate numbers from 1 to `n` and print them as separate arguments.

**Output:**
The output will be a string starting with `'2 n'` followed by the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

**Example:**
If `n` is 5, the output will be:
```
2 5 1 2 3 4 5
```

**General Format:**
Output: **2 n 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the input integer)**

Thus, the final output in the required format is:
Output: **2 n 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the input integer)**
