The value of `res` is updated by adding the result of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`. Given `i` is 2, we calculate the expression as follows:

\[
(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) = (2 + 1) * (2 * 2 + 1) = 3 * 5 = 15
\]

So, `res` becomes `7 + 15 = 22`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `mat`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `mat` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 22, `i` is 2**.
