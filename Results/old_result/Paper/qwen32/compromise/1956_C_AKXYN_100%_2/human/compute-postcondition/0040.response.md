The only variable in the loop head is `i`, as it is the only variable that changes with each iteration of the loop. According to the code, the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration and continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, making it 2. The other variables `t`, `n`, `mat`, and `res` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is 5, `mat` is a list of 5 lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to 5, `res` is 95, `i` is 2**
