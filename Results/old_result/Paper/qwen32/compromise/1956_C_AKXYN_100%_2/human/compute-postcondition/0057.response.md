Let's break down the given information and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

**Initial State:**
- `t` must be greater than or equal to 1 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it's part of the initial state).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `mat` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n` (though `mat` is not used in the print statement, it's part of the initial state).
- `res` is the sum of the series \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \cdot (2i + 1)\) (though `res` is not used in the print statement, it's part of the initial state).
- `i` is `n`.

**Print Statement:**
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Substitute `i` with `n`:**
   - Since `i` is equal to `n`, the string `'1 %d' % i` will be formatted to `'1 %d' % n`, which means the integer `n` will replace the `%d` placeholder.
   - Therefore, the first part of the output will be `'1 n'` where `n` is the integer value.

2. **Evaluate `*range(1, n + 1)`:**
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - The `*` operator unpacks this range into individual arguments for the `print` function.
   - Therefore, the second part of the output will be the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

**Combining the Results:**
- The `print` statement will output `'1 n'` followed by the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

**Final Output:**
Given the initial state, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **1 n 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the input integer and the sequence 1 2 3 ... n represents numbers from 1 to n)**
