To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variable `res` is updated in each iteration.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n):
    res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
```

This loop runs `n` times, with `i` taking values from 0 to `n-1`. The expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` is added to `res` in each iteration.

Let's break down the contributions to `res` for each iteration:
- For `i = 0`: `(0 + 1) * (2 * 0 + 1) = 1 * 1 = 1`
- For `i = 1`: `(1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1) = 2 * 3 = 6`
- For `i = 2`: `(2 + 1) * (2 * 2 + 1) = 3 * 5 = 15`

We are given the cumulative results:
- After 1 iteration: `res = 1`
- After 2 iterations: `res = 1 + 6 = 7`
- After 3 iterations: `res = 1 + 6 + 15 = 22`

To find the final value of `res` after `n` iterations, we need to sum the series:
\[ \text{res} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) \]

This series can be simplified and calculated, but for the sake of this problem, we can compute it directly for any given `n`.

Given the pattern, let's compute the final `res` for a general `n` and then use it to find the output state.

Let's implement this in Python to calculate the final `res` for any `n` and then provide the output state:
```python
def calculate_res(n):
    res = 0
    for i in range(n):
        res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
    return res

# Let's assume n is given and calculate the final res
# Since n is not explicitly given, we can assume the maximum n from the provided states, which is 3
n = 3
final_res = calculate_res(n)
print(final_res)
```
```output
22
```
The final value of `res` after the loop executes all `n` iterations is 22 when `n` is 3. 

To generalize, we can calculate the final `res` for any `n`. However, since the problem specifies the states up to `n=3` and the pattern holds, we can conclude that for `n=3`, the final output state is:

Output State: **t must be greater than or equal to 1, n must be greater than 2, mat is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to n, res is 22, i is 2**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished with `n=3`, the value of `res` is 22, and the other variables remain as specified in the precondition.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **t must be greater than or equal to 1, n must be greater than 2, mat is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to n, res is 22, i is 2**
