The code snippet updates the value of `res` by adding the product of `(i + 1)` and `(2 * i + 1)` to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `mat`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the code snippet.

Given:
- `t` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`
- `res` is 0
- `i` is 0

The calculation for `res` is:
`res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`
`res += (0 + 1) * (2 * 0 + 1)`
`res += 1 * 1`
`res += 1`

Therefore, `res` becomes 1.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 1, `i` is 0**
