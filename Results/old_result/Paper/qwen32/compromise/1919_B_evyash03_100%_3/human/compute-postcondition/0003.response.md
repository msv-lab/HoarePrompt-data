The code calculates the value of `sub` as the difference between `length` and `count`. Given that `length` is the length of the string `expression` and `count` is the number of '+' characters in `expression`, `sub` will be the number of '-' characters in `expression`.

Output State: **expression is a string consisting of characters '+' and '-', and length is an integer such that length = len(expression) and 1 <= length <= 5000; count is the number of '+' characters in the expression; sub is the number of '-' characters in the expression.**
