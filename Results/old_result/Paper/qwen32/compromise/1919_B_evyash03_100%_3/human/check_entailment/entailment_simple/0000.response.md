Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum penalty as described in the problem statement. The program simply calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and returns that value. This does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.

The correct approach involves dynamic programming or a greedy strategy to determine the optimal splits that minimize the total penalty. The provided function does not perform any splits or consider the penalties of those splits; it just counts the '+' and '-' characters and returns their absolute difference, which is not the correct solution for the problem.

For example, consider the third test case in the problem statement: `expression = "+-+-+-"`. The optimal split would be `([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1])`, leading to a penalty of `0 + 0 = 0`. However, the provided function would return `abs(3 - 3) = 0`, which coincidentally matches the correct answer for this case, but this is not a general solution.

The function does not implement the required logic to find the minimum penalty for arbitrary inputs, making the program incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
