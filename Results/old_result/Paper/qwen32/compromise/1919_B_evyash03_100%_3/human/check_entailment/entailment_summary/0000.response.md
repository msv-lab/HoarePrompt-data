Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The task requires finding the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array derived from the string `s` into subarrays and calculating the penalties based on the rules given. The program, however, calculates and returns only the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, which does not account for the optimal splitting or the penalty calculation steps as outlined in the problem description.

The optimal solution involves dynamic programming or a greedy approach to find the best way to split the array to minimize the total penalty, which is not implemented in the given code.

Correctness: **False**
