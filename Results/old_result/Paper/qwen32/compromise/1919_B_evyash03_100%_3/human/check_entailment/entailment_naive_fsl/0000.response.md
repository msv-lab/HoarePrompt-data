Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the program and identify issues:

1. **Logic of the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the length of the string and the string itself.
   - It then calls the `func_1` function with the string and its length.
   - The `func_1` function counts the number of '+' characters in the string.
   - It calculates `sub` as the difference between the length of the string and the count of '+' characters (which is equivalent to the count of '-' characters).
   - Finally, it returns the absolute difference between `sub` and `count`.

2. **Issues with the Logic:**
   - The program does not perform any splitting of the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty.
   - The penalty calculation is not done as per the problem description. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The program simply returns the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which has no relation to the penalty calculation described in the problem.

3. **Example to Show Incorrectness:**

   Let's consider the input:
   ```
   1
   4
   ++--
   ```
   - The program will count 2 '+' and 2 '-' characters.
   - It will then calculate `sub` as `4 - 2 = 2`.
   - The absolute difference between `sub` and `count` is `|2 - 2| = 0`.
   - The output will be `0`.

   However, the correct way to split the array to minimize the penalty is to split it into `([1, 1], [-1, -1])` (or `([+], [+], [-], [-])`), which gives a penalty of `|1+1|*2 + |-1-1|*2 = 4`.

   Therefore, the program does not correctly compute the minimum penalty for this case.

Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect and does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**.
