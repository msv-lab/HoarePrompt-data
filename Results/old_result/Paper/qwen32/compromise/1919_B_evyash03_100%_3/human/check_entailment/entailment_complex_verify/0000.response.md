### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Program Logic Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the length of the string and the string itself.
   - It then calls the `func_1` function with the string and its length.
   - Inside `func_1`, it counts the number of '+' characters in the string.
   - It calculates `sub` as the difference between the length of the string and the count of '+' characters, which essentially gives the count of '-' characters.
   - The function returns the absolute difference between the count of '+' characters and the count of '-' characters.

2. **Penalty Calculation as per Problem Statement:**
   - The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The program does not perform any splitting of the array into subarrays. It simply counts the '+' and '-' characters and returns their absolute difference.
   - This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

3. **Example to Show Incorrectness:**
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     4
     ++--
     ```
   - The program will count 2 '+' and 2 '-' characters.
   - It will then calculate `sub` as `4 - 2 = 2`.
   - The absolute difference between `sub` and `count` is `|2 - 2| = 0`.
   - The output will be `0`.

   However, the correct way to split the array to minimize the penalty is to split it into `([1, 1], [-1, -1])` (or `([+], [+], [-], [-])`), which gives a penalty of `|1+1|*2 + |-1-1|*2 = 4`.

4. **General Case:**
   - The program's logic does not generalize to finding the optimal subarray splits to minimize the penalty.
   - It only computes the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is not related to the penalty calculation described in the problem.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program is incorrect because it does not perform the required optimal splitting and penalty calculation as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
