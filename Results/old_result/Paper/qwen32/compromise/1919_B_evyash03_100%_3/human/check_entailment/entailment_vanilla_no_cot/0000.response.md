Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty for the given problem. The program simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and then computes the absolute difference between these counts, which does not take into account the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

The correct approach involves dynamic programming or a greedy strategy to determine the optimal splits. The provided program fails to consider the penalties associated with different possible splits of the array and thus does not solve the problem as described.
