### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the provided program does not correctly compute the minimum penalty for all test cases. Let's break it down systematically:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to split the string `s` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty for a subarray is calculated as the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by the length of the subarray.
   - The string `s` is converted into an array `a` where each '+' is 1 and each '-' is -1.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string.
   - This calculation does not consider any splitting of the array and does not account for the penalty calculation as described in the problem.

3. **Example Evaluation**:
   - **First Test Case**: Input `+` → Output `1` (Correct)
   - **Second Test Case**: Input `-----` → Output `5` (Correct)
   - **Third Test Case**: Input `+-+-+-` → Output `0` (Correct)
   - **Fourth Test Case**: Input `--+++++++` → Output `5` (Incorrect, should be `4`)
   - **Fifth Test Case**: Input `+---++++-+++++---++-` → Output `4` (Incorrect, optimal split not guaranteed)

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_1` does not implement an algorithm to find the optimal splits that minimize the total penalty.
   - The program fails to provide the correct output for some test cases, as demonstrated by the fourth and fifth test cases.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is correct in stating that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
