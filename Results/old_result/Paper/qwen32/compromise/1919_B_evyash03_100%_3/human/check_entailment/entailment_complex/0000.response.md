Reasoning:
The provided program calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `expression`. However, this does not necessarily give the minimum penalty as described in the problem.

The problem requires us to split the array into subarrays such that the total penalty, which is the sum of the penalties of each subarray, is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length.

The given function does not perform any splitting of the array into subarrays. Instead, it simply calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is not equivalent to minimizing the penalty as defined in the problem.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to implement a strategy that considers different ways of splitting the array and calculates the penalty for each possible split to find the minimum possible penalty.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
