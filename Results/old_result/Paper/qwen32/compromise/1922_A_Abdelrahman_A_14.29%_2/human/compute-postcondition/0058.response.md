Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` and `b` are input strings, `c` is the input string, `slength` is the input integer, `tests` is greater than 0, and `i` is incremented by 1. `no` is set to True and all characters in `c` are in either `a` or `b`.**
