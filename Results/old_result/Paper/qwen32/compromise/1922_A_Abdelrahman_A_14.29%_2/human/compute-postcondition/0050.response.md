Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` and `b` are input strings, `c` is the input string that must have at least 2 characters, `slength` is the input integer, `tests` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is the next character in `c`. If `x` is not in `a` and `x` is not in `b`, then `no` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to `no` and the loop or statement continues.**
