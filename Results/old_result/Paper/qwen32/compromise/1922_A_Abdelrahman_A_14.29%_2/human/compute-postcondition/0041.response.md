Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the input string, `b` is the input string, `c` is the input string that must have at least 1 character, `slength` is the input integer, `tests` is greater than 0, `no` is True, `i` is incremented by 1, and `x` is not in `a` and `x` is not in `b`.**
