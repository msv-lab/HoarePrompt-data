Let's break down the given task:

Initial State: 
- `c` is a string with at least one character.
- `x` is the next character in the string `c`.

We are given a `print` statement:
```python
print('YES')
```

The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the variables `c` or `x`. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Explanation:
- The variable `c` is a string with at least one character, but its exact value is not specified.
- The variable `x` is described as the next character in the string `c`, but it is not used in the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement is hardcoded to output `'YES'`, the actual values of `c` and `x` do not influence the output.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **YES**
