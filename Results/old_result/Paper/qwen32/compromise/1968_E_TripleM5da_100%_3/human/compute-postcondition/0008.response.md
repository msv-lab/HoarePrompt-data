The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n` and starts from 3 up to `n + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, and `n` must be at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 5. The value of `n` must still be at least 4, and for the loop to continue, `n` must be at least 5 since `i` is now 5.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` must be at least 5, `i` is 5**
