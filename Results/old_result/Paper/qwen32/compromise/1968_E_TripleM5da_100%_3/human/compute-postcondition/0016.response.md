The provided initial state does not specify any information about the variable `i`. The only information given is that `n` must be at least 3, but `n` is not used in the `print` statement. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value from the given information.

However, if we assume that `i` should be defined in the context of the problem (which is not provided here), we cannot proceed without that definition.

Given the current information, we can only state that `i` is an undefined variable, and attempting to print it would result in a `NameError` in Python. But based on the task instructions, we will describe the output in the format requested.

Output: **i, i (where i is an undefined variable)**
