In the given task, the for loop's execution depends on the value of `n` which is obtained from the `input()` function. The loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is the integer provided as input. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`, but `i` is initialized within the `range` function and does not need to be adjusted beforehand. The critical factor is ensuring that `n` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute the desired number of times.

Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3. However, the loop directly depends on the value of `n` provided by the `input()` function during runtime, not on the initial state of `t` or the range of `n`.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least 1 (since the loop will execute `n` times, and `n=0` would mean no iterations). However, based on the problem statement, `n` is guaranteed to be at least 2, so the loop will definitely execute.

Since the loop head only involves `i` (which is controlled by the `range` function) and `n` (which is input during runtime), and given the constraints that `n` is at least 2, no adjustment to the initial state of `t` or `n` is strictly necessary for the loop to execute. However, to align with the task's requirement to specify the state, we can consider `n` as the input value that will control the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and `n` (obtained from input()) is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3**
