To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if the range `(3, n + 1)` is non-empty, meaning `n` must be at least 3. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is unchanged (this variable is not in the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted).
- `n` is the integer value of the input.
- `i` is `n` (this will be overwritten by the loop, so its initial value doesn't affect the loop's execution).

For the loop to execute:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `i` does not need to be adjusted because its initial value is irrelevant since it will be set to 3 on the first iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `n` is at least 3.

State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n`**
