The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the value provided by `int(input())`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`. However, since `i` is currently `n + 1`, the loop will not execute again because `i` is not less than the input value (which we can assume to be `n` for the sake of this task).

To adjust the state so that the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be set to a value less than `n`. Since we are at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be set to `n` to allow the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `i` is `n`**
