The `print(1, 2)` statement in the code will output the numbers 1 and 2 separated by a space, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `i` as they are not used in the `print` statement.

### Explanation:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 50.
- `n` is an integer value obtained from the `input()` function.
- `i` is an integer that must be less than `n`.

However, these variables are not referenced in the `print(1, 2)` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 2**
