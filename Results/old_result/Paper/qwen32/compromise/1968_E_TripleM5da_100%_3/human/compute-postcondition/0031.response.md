Given the initial state:
- `t` is unchanged (though `t` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task).
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `i` is set to the value of `n`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(i, i)
```

Since `i` is set to `n`, both values to be printed are the same and equal to `n`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `n` printed twice.

Output: **n, n (where n is a value greater than or equal to 3)**
