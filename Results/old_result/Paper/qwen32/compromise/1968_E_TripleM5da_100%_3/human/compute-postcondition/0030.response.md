To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(3, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop iterates with `i` starting from 3 up to `n` inclusive.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is unchanged
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3
- `i` is `n - 1`

For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be incremented by 1 and should still be within the range `[3, n]`. Since `i` is currently `n - 1`, incrementing `i` by 1 will make `i` equal to `n`. This is still within the range `[3, n]` as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 3.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `n`
- `n` remains the same

State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n`**
