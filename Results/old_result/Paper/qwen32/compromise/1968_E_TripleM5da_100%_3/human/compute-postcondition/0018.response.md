Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` must be at least 3.
- `i` is defined as `n - 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i, i)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is defined as `n - 1`, and `n` is at least 3, the minimum value of `i` would be `3 - 1 = 2`.
   - If `n` were 4, `i` would be `4 - 1 = 3`.
   - If `n` were 5, `i` would be `5 - 1 = 4`.
   - And so on...

2. **What is printed**:
   - The `print(i, i)` statement will print the value of `i` twice.
   - Given that `i` is `n - 1` and `n` is at least 3, the smallest possible value for `i` is 2. However, since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can only describe `i` in terms of `n`.

### Final Output:
The value of `i` is `n - 1`, and since `n` is at least 3, `i` will be at least 2. The `print(i, i)` statement will print the value of `i` twice.

Output: **i, i (where i is n - 1 and n is at least 3)**
