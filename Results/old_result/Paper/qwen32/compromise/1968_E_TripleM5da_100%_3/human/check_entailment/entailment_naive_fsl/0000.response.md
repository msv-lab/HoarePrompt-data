Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). While the program works correctly for \(n = 2\), it fails to provide an optimal solution for \(n > 2\).

Let's analyze the program for \(n = 3\):
- The program outputs: 
  ```
  1 1
  1 2
  3 3
  ```
- The set \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:
  - Distance between (1, 1) and (1, 2): \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
  - Distance between (1, 1) and (3, 3): \(|1-3| + |1-3| = 4\)
  - Distance between (1, 2) and (3, 3): \(|1-3| + |2-3| = 3\)
- Hence, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 3, 4\}\), which has a size of 4.

However, the optimal solution for \(n = 3\) is:
- Points: (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1)
- The set \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:
  - Distance between (2, 1) and (2, 3): \(|2-2| + |1-3| = 2\)
  - Distance between (2, 1) and (3, 1): \(|2-3| + |1-1| = 1\)
  - Distance between (2, 3) and (3, 1): \(|2-3| + |3-1| = 3\)
- Hence, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 4.

The program does not generate the optimal set of points for \(n > 2\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
