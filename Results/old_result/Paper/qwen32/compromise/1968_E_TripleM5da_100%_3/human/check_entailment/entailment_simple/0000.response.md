Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all values of n. The goal is to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of chosen cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program starts by placing two cells at (1,1) and (1,2) for each test case, and then places the remaining cells along the diagonal from (3,3) to (n,n).

However, this strategy does not guarantee that the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances will be achieved. The placement of cells should be carefully chosen to maximize the variety of distances. For example, for n=3, the optimal placement would be (2,1), (2,3), and (3,1) as shown in the example, which results in the set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\). The given program would instead place cells at (1,1), (1,2), (3,3), resulting in a smaller set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2\}\).

Therefore, the program does not always produce the optimal solution for maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

Correctness: **False**
