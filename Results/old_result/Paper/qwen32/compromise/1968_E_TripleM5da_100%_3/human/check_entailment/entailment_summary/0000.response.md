Reasoning:
The given program is supposed to output `n` points for each test case in such a way that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of points is maximized. Let's analyze the program's behavior based on the problem requirements and the provided execution summary.

The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and then prints the points as follows:
- It prints the point (1, 1).
- It prints the point (1, 2).
- It prints the points (i, i) for i ranging from 3 to n.

Let's consider the output for the first few test cases:
- For `n=2`, the output is (1, 1) and (1, 2). The set of Manhattan distances is {0, 1}.
- For `n=3`, the output is (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 3). The set of Manhattan distances is {0, 1, 2, 4}.
- For `n=4`, the output is (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3), and (4, 4). The set of Manhattan distances is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
- For `n=5`, the output is (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), and (5, 5). The set of Manhattan distances is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.
- For `n=6`, the output is (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), and (6, 6). The set of Manhattan distances is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

However, the problem description provides an example for `n=3` where the points are (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1). This arrangement yields the set of Manhattan distances {0, 1, 2, 3}, which is larger than the set {0, 1, 2, 4} produced by the given program.

The program does not maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of `n`. It only places two points on the first row and the rest on the diagonal, which is not an optimal strategy for maximizing the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not always produce the optimal solution.

Correctness: **False**
