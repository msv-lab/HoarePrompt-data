You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        l = 0
        h = 0
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each of the t test cases, there is a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        l = 0
        
        h = 0
        
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the program reads a string of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B', counts the occurrences of 'A' (`l`) and other characters (`h`), and prints 'A' if `l` is greater than `h`, otherwise it prints 'B'. The variables `l` and `h` are reset for each iteration, and `i` ranges from 0 to `t-1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The function starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: It then enters a loop that will iterate `t` times, once for each test case.
3. **Reading Each String**: For each test case, it reads a string `a` of length 5.
4. **Counting Characters**: It initializes two counters, `l` and `h`, to zero. These will be used to count the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', respectively.
5. **Character Counting Loop**: It iterates through each character `j` in the string `a`. If `j` is 'A', it increments `l`; otherwise, it increments `h`.
6. **Determine Most Frequent Character**: After counting the characters, it compares `l` and `h`. If `l` is greater than `h`, it prints 'A', indicating that 'A' appears more frequently. Otherwise, it prints 'B'.
7. **Handling Ties**: The logic in the program assumes that if `l` is not greater than `h`, then 'B' must be the most frequent character. This is correct because the string length is fixed at 5, and since all characters are either 'A' or 'B', there can't be a tie where both 'A' and 'B' appear exactly 2.5 times. In the case of a tie (both appearing 2 or 3 times), the program will correctly choose 'B'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine which character ('A' or 'B') appears most frequently in each of the given strings. It handles all possible cases within the constraints provided.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
