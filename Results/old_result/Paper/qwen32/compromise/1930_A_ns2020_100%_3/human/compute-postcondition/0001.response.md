In this task, the `while` loop condition is `while t:`. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered `True` in a boolean context, and a zero integer is considered `False`. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be a non-zero integer.

Given that the state right before the loop is `t` is the number of test cases (an integer between 1 and 5000), `t` is already guaranteed to be a non-zero integer. Therefore, no adjustment is needed to ensure that the loop will execute the first time.

State: **`t` is the number of test cases (an integer between 1 and 5000)**
