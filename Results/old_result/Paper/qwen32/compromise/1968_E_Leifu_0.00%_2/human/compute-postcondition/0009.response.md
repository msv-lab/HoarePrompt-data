The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust only these variables for the loop to execute.

The `for` loop will execute if the range `(4, n + 1)` is non-empty. This means `n + 1` must be greater than `4`, or equivalently, `n` must be greater than `3`. Given the condition `n` is not equal to `3`, this means `n` must be at least `4`.

The variable `j` is the loop variable and will be initialized to `4` at the start of the loop, so we don't need to adjust its value before the loop starts.

Given the state `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 50`, this state does not affect the execution of the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50; `n` is an integer and `n` must be greater than 3**
