To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop runs from `j = 4` to `j = n` (inclusive). It prints `j j` for each value of `j` in this range.

Given the conditions in the problem:
- The loop executes at least once if `n > 3`.
- The loop executes at least twice if `n > 4`.
- The loop executes at least three times if `n > 5`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute all its iterations, `n` must be at least 4 (since the loop starts at 4) and we need to consider the full range from 4 to `n`.

The loop will execute for all values of `j` from 4 to `n`. After the loop completes, `j` will be `n + 1` because the loop increments `j` and stops when `j` reaches `n + 1`.

Here is the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50; `n` is an integer and `n` must be greater than or equal to 4; `j` is an integer such that `j` = `n` + 1**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of `t` remains unchanged within the range 1 to 50. The value of `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to run at all. The value of `j` will be `n + 1` because the loop increments `j` until it reaches `n + 1` and then terminates.
