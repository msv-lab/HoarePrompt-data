Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is the integer input by the user. If `n` is 3, `j` remains unchanged from its previous definition or is undefined if it wasn't defined before. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is `n`.**

Natural Language: The value of `n` is updated to the integer input by the user. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `j` remains unchanged if `n` is 3, or is set to `n` if `n` is 4 or greater.
