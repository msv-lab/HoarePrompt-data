To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for j in range(4, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50
- `i` is `t`
- `n` must be at least 4
- `j` is 4

Since `j` is the loop variable and it iterates from 4 to `n` (inclusive), at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1. The value of `n` does not change as it is the upper bound of the range.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` should be 5 (since it was 4 at the end of the previous iteration and will be incremented by 1).
- `n` remains at least 4, but since `j` is now 5, `n` must be at least 5 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, `i` is `t`, `n` must be at least 5, `j` is 5**
