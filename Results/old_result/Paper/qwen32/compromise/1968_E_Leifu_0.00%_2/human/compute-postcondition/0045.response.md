Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, `i` is `t-1` (indicating the loop has completed all `t` iterations), `n` is the integer input by the user for the last test case. If `n` is 3 for the last test case, `j` is either undefined or retains its previous value from the last iteration where it was defined. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4 for the last test case, `j` is equal to `n`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all `t` iterations, `i` will be `t-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its cycles. The variable `n` will hold the value of the last test case input by the user. The variable `j` will either be undefined or will have the value of `n` if `n` was greater than or equal to 4 in the last test case.
