The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print('2 4')
```

The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `j`, but none of these variables are used in the print statement. The print statement directly outputs the string `'2 4'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 50.
2. The variable `i` is defined as `t - 1`.
3. The variable `n` is an integer input by the user.
4. The variable `j` is defined conditionally based on the value of `n`:
   - If `n` is 3, `j` remains unchanged or is undefined.
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is set to `n`.

However, none of these variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `j`) are referenced in the print statement. The print statement simply outputs the string `'2 4'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **2 4**
