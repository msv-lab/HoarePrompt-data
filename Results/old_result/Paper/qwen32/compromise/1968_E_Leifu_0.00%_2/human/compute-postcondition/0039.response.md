The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `t-1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 4. The variable `j` is the loop variable and is incremented by 1 in each iteration. Since we are at the start of the next iteration, `j` needs to be incremented from its previous value.

Given that the loop starts with `j` in the range from 4 to `n`, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be the next integer after its previous value. If `j` was 4 in the previous iteration, it should now be 5, and so on.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, `i` is `t-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `j` is 4 (if it was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, or incremented accordingly)**
  
However, since we do not know the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize that `j` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value. Assuming `j` was 4 at the start of the first iteration, at the start of the second iteration, `j` should be 5, and so forth.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, `i` is `t-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `j` is 5**

If `j` was 5 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 6, and so on. The exact value of `j` depends on its value at the end of the previous iteration, but it should be incremented by 1.

For the sake of a generalized answer, if `j` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `x + 1`.

But to provide a concrete example following the pattern:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, `i` is `t-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `j` is 5**

This assumes `j` was 4 at the start of the first iteration and is now 5 at the start of the second iteration. If `j` was a different value at the end of the previous iteration, adjust `j` accordingly by incrementing it by 1.
