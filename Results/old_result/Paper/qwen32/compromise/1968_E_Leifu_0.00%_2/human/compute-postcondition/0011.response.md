The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is in the range from 4 to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `j` must have taken on a value that allowed the loop to continue. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1 and still be less than or equal to `n`.

Given that `j` was the loop variable in the previous iteration, it must have been a value between 4 and `n-1` (inclusive) to allow the loop to continue. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be increased by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50; `n` is an integer and `n` must be greater than 3; `j` is an integer such that 5 <= `j` <= `n`**
