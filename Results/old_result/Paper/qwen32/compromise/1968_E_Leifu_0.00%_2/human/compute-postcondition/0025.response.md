The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, the loop continues to execute as long as `j` is in the range from 4 to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n + 1`, which means the loop has just finished executing because `j` was out of the valid range.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be within the range from 4 to `n`. Since `j` is `n + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `j` to the next value that would allow the loop to execute. This would be 4 if `n` is at least 4 (as specified).

Given that `i` is `t` and `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, and `n` must be at least 4, we only need to adjust `j` to 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, `i` is `t`, `n` must be at least 4, `j` is 4**
