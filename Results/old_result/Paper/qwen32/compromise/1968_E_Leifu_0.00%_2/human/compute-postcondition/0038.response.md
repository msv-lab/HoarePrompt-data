Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
2. `i` is defined as `t - 1`.
3. `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.
4. `j` is irrelevant before the loop starts.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `j` is mentioned as being "irrelevant before the loop starts." This implies that `j` has not been assigned any value in the given initial state.
- In Python, if you try to use a variable that has not been assigned a value, it will raise a `NameError`.
- Since the problem statement does not provide any information about the assignment of `j` before the print statement is executed, we can conclude that `j` is undefined in the context provided.

### Conclusion:
Given that `j` is undefined, attempting to execute `print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))` will result in a `NameError`.

However, if we strictly adhere to the format requested and consider the scenario where `j` might be intended to be used without an explicit value provided (though this is not valid in Python), we would describe the output as undefined.

Output: **NameError: name 'j' is not defined** (This is the expected behavior in Python if `j` is not defined)

Since the task specifically asks to provide the most precise description possible based on the precondition, and since `j` is stated to be irrelevant and undefined, the output that aligns with the given format is:

Output: **NameError: name 'j' is not defined**
