The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 5, `n` is greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 6, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, `i` is `t-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 6, `j` is 6**
