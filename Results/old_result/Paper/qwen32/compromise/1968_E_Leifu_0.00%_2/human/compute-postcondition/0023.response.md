To ensure the for loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if the range `(4, n + 1)` is not empty, meaning `n` must be at least 4.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50.
- `i` is `t`.
- `n` is the integer input by the user.
- If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, then `j` is `n` + 1.
- If `n` is 3, `j` remains unchanged or is undefined.

To make sure the loop executes, `n` must be at least 4. The value of `j` before the loop starts does not affect whether the loop will execute, but it should be consistent with the condition that `j` is `n + 1` if `n` is 4 or more.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is at least 4. The value of `j` should be `n + 1` to be consistent with the given condition. The values of `t` and `i` do not affect the loop execution, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, `i` is `t`, `n` must be at least 4, `j` is `n` + 1**
