To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `j`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50.
- `n` is an integer and `n` must be greater than 3.
- `j` is an integer such that 5 <= `j` <= `n`.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(4, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, `j` should be `j + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound of the loop range.
- `j` is incremented by 1.

So, if `j` was 5 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 6 at the start of the next iteration. For the loop to continue, `j` must still be less than or equal to `n`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, `n` is an integer and `n` must be greater than 3, `j` is an integer such that 6 <= `j` <= `n`**
