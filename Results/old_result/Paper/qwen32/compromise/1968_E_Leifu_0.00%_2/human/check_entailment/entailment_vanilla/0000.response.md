Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to handle the input and output for maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between pairs of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. However, the logic in the program does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\).

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \(n\).

2. **Output for Specific Cases:**
   - For \(n = 2\), it outputs the points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\). This is correct because the set \(\mathcal{H}\) will be \(\{0, 1\}\), which is optimal for \(n = 2\).
   - For \(n = 3\), it outputs the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\). This is also correct because the set \(\mathcal{H}\) will be \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which is optimal for \(n = 3\).

3. **Output for General Cases (n >= 4):**
   - For \(n \geq 4\), the program outputs the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and then \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\). This strategy does not maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances for \(n \geq 4\).

The problem requires finding a configuration of points that maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances. The provided program does not achieve this for \(n \geq 4\).

For example, for \(n = 4\), the optimal solution (as shown in the problem statement) includes points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 3)\), \((4, 3)\), and \((4, 4)\), which yield the set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\).

Thus, the program fails to provide the optimal solution for \(n \geq 4\).

Correctness: **False**
