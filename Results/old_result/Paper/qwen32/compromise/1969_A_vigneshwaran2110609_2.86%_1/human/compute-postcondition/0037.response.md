The `print(2)` statement in the given code snippet will output the integer `2`. This is because the `print` function is explicitly instructed to print the number `2`, and this is not dependent on the values of `x`, `i`, or `flag` as described in the initial state.

The variables `x`, `i`, and `flag` are mentioned in the initial state, but they do not affect the output of the `print(2)` statement since it is not using these variables in any way.

Output: **2**
