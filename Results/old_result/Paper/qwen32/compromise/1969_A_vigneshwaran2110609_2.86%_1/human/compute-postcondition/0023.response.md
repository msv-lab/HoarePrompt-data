The code snippet provided takes an input, splits it into a list of integers, and assigns this list to the variable `l`. The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `x` is an input integer. Therefore, the output state will include the new variable `l` which is a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, `x` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
