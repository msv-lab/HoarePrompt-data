The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to prepare for the next iteration.

From the provided information, we know:
- The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`.
- The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- The state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `i` has some value, and `n` is the upper limit of the loop.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to increment `i` by 1, and `n` should remain the same as it is the upper limit of the loop.

Given that the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is checked inside the loop, we do not need to modify the list `l` or any other variables outside the loop head. We only need to adjust `i` and ensure that `n` is correctly set to allow the loop to continue.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `i` is some value, let's say `k`, and `n` is the upper limit.

State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `n` is the same upper limit**.

Since we do not have the specific value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize the state as follows:

State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` remains the same**.

If we assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `n` is the same upper limit**.

To make it more concrete, if we say `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` remains the same**.

But in a generalized form without specific values:

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same**.
