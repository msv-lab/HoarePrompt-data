Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged, `x` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `l[i] - 1`; `flag` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
