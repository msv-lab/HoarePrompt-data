### Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the problem requirements and the program's logic:

1. **Problem Requirements:**
   - For each test case, we need to determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - A friend `i` will come to the party if both `i` and `p_i` receive invitations.
   - We need to print the minimum number of invitations for each test case.

2. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list `p` of best friends.
   - The program then iterates through the list `p` and checks if `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`. This condition does not correctly determine whether two friends can come to the party.
   - If the condition is met, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the condition is not met after checking all elements, it prints `3`.

### Issues with the Program:
- The condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` does not accurately reflect the problem requirements.
- The program does not consider the correct logic to determine the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least two friends come to the party.
- The program assumes that if any friend `i` and their best friend `p_i` can be invited with just two invitations, it will print `2`. However, this is not always the case, and the program does not handle scenarios where more than two invitations are needed.

### Correct Approach:
- We need to find pairs of friends `(i, p_i)` such that both friends can be invited with the minimum number of invitations.
- We can use a graph-based approach or a simple counting method to determine the minimum number of invitations required.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as per the given requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
