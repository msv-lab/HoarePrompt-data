The code snippet `a[i] = prod // a[i]` modifies the value of `a[i]` by dividing `prod` by the current value of `a[i]` and then assigning the result back to `a[i]`. The other variables `t`, `T`, `g`, `l`, and `bets` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is 0, `bets` is an integer greater than 0, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`.**
