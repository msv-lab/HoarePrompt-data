The code modifies the variable `g` by multiplying it with `l[i]` and then dividing the result by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `g` and `l[i]`. This operation effectively updates `g` to the least common multiple (LCM) of its previous value and `l[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 2, `g` is `lcm(g, l[i])`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `bets` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers where the first element is `prod // a[0]`, `prod` is the LCM of all elements in `a` before the modification, `i` is `i + 1`, `sumo` is `bets * (prod // a[0])`**

In simpler terms, the variable `g` is now the least common multiple of its previous value and the element `l[i]` from the list `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
