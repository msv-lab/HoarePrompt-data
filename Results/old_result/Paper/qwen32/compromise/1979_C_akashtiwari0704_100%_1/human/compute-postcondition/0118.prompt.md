Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, and `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` are integers such that 2 <= `k_i` <= 20. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):

    def lcm(l):
        g = 1
        for i in range(len(l)):
            g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
        return g
    bets = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    prod = lcm(a)
    sumo = 0
    for i in range(bets):
        a[i] = prod // a[i]
        sumo += int(a[i])
    if sumo >= prod:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = ''
        for i in range(bets):
            ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `bets` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where the first `bets` elements are modified to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the LCM of all elements in `a`, and `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` modified elements of `a`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the function does not modify `ans` or `i`. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the string representation of the first `bets` modified elements of `a` each followed by a space, and `i` is equal to `bets`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 1, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `bets` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers where the first element is `prod // a[0]`, `prod` is the LCM of all elements in `a` before the modification, `i` is either 0 or `bets - 1`, and `sumo` is `bets * (prod // a[0])`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the program does not modify `i`. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, `bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is set to `bets - 1`, and `ans` is a string with `bets` number of space-separated integers from `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 2, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `bets` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list where each element a[i] is `prod // a[i]` for i in range(bets), `prod` is the LCM of all elements in the new `a`, `i` is `bets - 1`, and `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the new `a`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the current state of the variables remains as described. Otherwise, the string representations of all elements in the list `a`, each followed by a space, are output.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
