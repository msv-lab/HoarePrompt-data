Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is equal to `t - 1`, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l` for the last test case, `l` is a list with at least one element for the last test case, `bets` is an input integer for the last test case and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]` for `i` in range(`bets`) for the last test case, `prod` is the LCM of all elements in the new `a` for the last test case, `i` is `bets - 1` for the last test case, and `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the new `a` for the last test case. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod` for the last test case, the program outputs `-1` for the last test case. Otherwise, the program outputs a string with `bets` number of space-separated integers from `a` for the last test case.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the loop will have processed `t` test cases. For the last test case, it calculates the least common multiple (`prod`) of a list of integers (`a`), modifies each element of `a` to be `prod // a[i]`, and calculates the sum of these modified elements (`sumo`). If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs the modified elements of `a` as a space-separated string. The variables `g`, `l`, `bets`, `a`, `prod`, `i`, and `sumo` will reflect the state of the last test case processed.
