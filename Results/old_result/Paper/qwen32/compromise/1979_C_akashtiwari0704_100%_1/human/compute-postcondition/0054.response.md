The code snippet `prod = lcm(a)` updates the value of `prod` to be the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 1, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `bets` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `prod` is the LCM of all elements in `a`, `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` modified elements of `a`, `i` is equal to the length of `l` minus one.**
