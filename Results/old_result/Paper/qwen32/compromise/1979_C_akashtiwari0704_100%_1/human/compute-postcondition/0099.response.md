The code snippet `a[i] = prod // a[i]` updates the value of the element at index `i` in the list `a` to be the integer division of `prod` by the current value of `a[i]`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `T` is 2.
- `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`.
- `l` is a list with at least one element.
- `bets` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a new list of integers read from the input with the first element updated to `prod // a[0]`.
- `prod` is the LCM of all elements in the new `a`.
- `i` is 1.
- `sumo` is `int(a[0])`.

After executing the code snippet, the value of `a[1]` is updated to `prod // a[1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 2, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `bets` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list where the first element is `prod // a[0]` and the second element is `prod // a[1]`, `prod` is the LCM of all elements in the new `a`, `i` is 1, and `sumo` is `int(a[0])`.**
