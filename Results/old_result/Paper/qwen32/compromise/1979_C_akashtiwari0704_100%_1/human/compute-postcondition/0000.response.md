Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50, and `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` are integers such that 2 <= `k_i` <= 20. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to the integer value provided by the input. The other conditions and variables (`n`, `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`) remain as they were in the initial state since they are not affected by the given code snippet.
