The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a new list `a`. This operation does not affect the variables `t`, `T`, `g`, `l`, `i`, or `bets`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is `len(l) - 1`, `bets` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
