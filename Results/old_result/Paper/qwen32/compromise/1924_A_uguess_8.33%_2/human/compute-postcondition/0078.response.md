Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet. If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is updated to 1 or 2. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged and `cnt` remains 0 or 1.**
