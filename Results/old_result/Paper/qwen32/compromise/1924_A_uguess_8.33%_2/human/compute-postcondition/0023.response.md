The code snippet provided updates the value of `cur_ss` by calculating the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` and the ASCII value of the character 'a'. This operation essentially converts the character `ss` into its 0-based index in the alphabet (where 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, ..., 'z' is 25).

Given that `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the current character, and `cur_ss` is updated to `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cur`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the current character, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cnt` and `cur` remain as per the conditions described.**
