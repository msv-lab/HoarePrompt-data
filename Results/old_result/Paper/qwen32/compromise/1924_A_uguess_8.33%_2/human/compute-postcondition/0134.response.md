The code snippet `tmp = ''` sets the variable `tmp` to an empty string. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are the input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered consecutively, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is an empty string, and `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times concatenated with `tmp` and then 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times. Additionally, `cnt` is less than `n`.**
