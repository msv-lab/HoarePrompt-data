Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are the input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered consecutively, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is an empty string, and `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` are the input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered consecutively, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is an empty string if the `i`-th bit of `cur` was set; otherwise, `tmp` is the character `chr(ord('a') + i)`, and `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` are the input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered consecutively, `cur` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If the `i`-th bit of `cur` was not set, `tmp` is 'b'; otherwise, `tmp` remains the character `chr(ord('a') + i)`, and `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` are the input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered consecutively, `cur` is 0, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. If `cur & 1 << i == 0`, `tmp` is set to the character corresponding to `chr(ord('a') + i)`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains as defined. `ans` remains as defined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
