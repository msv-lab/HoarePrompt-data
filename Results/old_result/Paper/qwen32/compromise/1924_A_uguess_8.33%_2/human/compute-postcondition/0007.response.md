The code snippet provided is:
```python
cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
```
However, there is a variable `ss` in the code that is not defined in the initial state. Assuming `ss` is a character in the string `s`, let's proceed with the assumption that `ss` is the first character of `s` for the purpose of this task.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5
- `n` is the first input integer
- `k` is the second input integer
- `m` is the third input integer
- `s` is a non-empty input string
- `cnt` is 0
- `cur` is 0

The code calculates the ASCII value of the character `ss` (assumed to be the first character of `s`) and subtracts the ASCII value of 'a'. This will give the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet, with 'a' being 0, 'b' being 1, and so on.

Let's denote the first character of `s` as `s[0]`. The output state will be:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5
- `n` remains the first input integer
- `k` remains the second input integer
- `m` remains the third input integer
- `s` remains a non-empty input string
- `cnt` remains 0
- `cur` remains 0
- `cur_ss` is assigned the value `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`**
