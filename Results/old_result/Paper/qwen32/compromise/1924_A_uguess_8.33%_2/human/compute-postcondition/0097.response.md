The code snippet `ans += tmp` appends the value of `tmp` to the existing value of `ans`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5
- `n`, `k` must be greater than 0
- `m`, `s` are input integers and string respectively
- `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` and `cnt` is less than `n`
- `cur` remains unchanged
- `tmp` is the last letter in the alphabet corresponding to a 0 bit in `cur` if any, otherwise it remains as the initial value (which is an empty string)
- `ans` is the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times

After executing `ans += tmp`, the value of `ans` will be the original `ans` concatenated with `tmp`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` are input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` and `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` remains unchanged, `tmp` is the last letter in the alphabet corresponding to a 0 bit in `cur` if any, otherwise it remains as the initial value (which is an empty string), and `ans` is the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times concatenated with `tmp`.**
