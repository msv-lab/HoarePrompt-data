The code snippet `cnt = 0` sets the variable `cnt` to 0. This means the count of how many times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` is reset to 0. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are the input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` (unchanged), `tmp` is the `k`-th letter in the alphabet if `cnt` is 0, otherwise the last valid character assigned (unchanged), `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times concatenated with `tmp` and then 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times (unchanged), `i` is `i + 1` (unchanged)**.
