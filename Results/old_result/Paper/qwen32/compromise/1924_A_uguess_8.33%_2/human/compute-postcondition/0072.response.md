The only object in the loop head is the variable `ss`, which is the current character from the string `s` in each iteration. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the next character in the string `s`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5.
- `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers.
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `cnt` is 0 or 1.
- `i` is 0.
- `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of `s[next_index]` in the alphabet.
- `ss` is `s[next_index]`.
- The logic for `cur` and `cnt` is based on the value of `ss`.

Since the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, at the start of the next iteration, `ss` should be the next character in the string. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `cnt`, `i`, `cur_ss`, and `cur`) do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head, but we need to ensure `ss` reflects the next character in the iteration.

Let's assume the current `ss` is `s[i]`. At the start of the next iteration, `ss` should be `s[i+1]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `i` is 0, `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of `s[next_index]` in the alphabet, `ss` is `s[i+1]`**.

However, since `i` is not being updated in the loop head, we need to consider `ss` as the next character in the sequence without directly adjusting `i`. Therefore, if `ss` was `s[i]` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `ss` should be `s[i+1]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `i` is 0, `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of `s[next_index]` in the alphabet, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `ss`**.

Given that `ss` is the current character, the next state of `ss` should be the subsequent character in the string `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `i` is 0, `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of `s[next_index]` in the alphabet, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`**.

Since `ss` is the loop variable, it will naturally take the next value in the string `s` in the next iteration. Therefore, we do not need to explicitly change `i` or `cur_ss` in the state description for the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `i` is 0, `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of the next character in `s` in the alphabet, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`**.

Since `ss` is the loop variable, it will be updated to the next character in `s` naturally in the loop head. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `i` is 0, `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of the next character in `s` in the alphabet, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`**.

Simplified State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `i` is 0, `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of `s[i+1]` in the alphabet, `ss` is `s[i+1]`**.

Since `i` is not part of the loop head, we do not adjust it directly:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of the next character in `s` in the alphabet, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`**.

Final State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of the next character in `s` in the alphabet, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`**.

Since `ss` is the loop variable, it will be updated to the next character in `s` naturally in the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`**.

Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`**.
