The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`. The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers with certain constraints, and `s` is a string. After executing the code, `n`, `k`, and `m` will be updated with the new values read from the input. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `s` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets**.
