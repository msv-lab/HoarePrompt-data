The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, which means `i` has been incremented. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `k`.

Given that `i` was incremented at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `i` to the next value it should take in the loop. If `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, then before the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration.

So, if `i` was incremented to `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` are input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` and `cnt` is less than `n`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
