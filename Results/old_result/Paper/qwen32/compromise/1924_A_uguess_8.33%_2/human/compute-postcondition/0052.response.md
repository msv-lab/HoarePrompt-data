The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, `i`, `tmp`, and `ans`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times a sequence of `k` distinct characters was encountered in `s`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `cur` is the bitmask of characters encountered in the final segment of `s` that did not complete a sequence of `k` distinct characters. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is the bitmask of characters encountered in the final segment of `s` that did not complete a sequence of `k` distinct characters, `i` is 0, `tmp` is the `k`-th letter in the alphabet if the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0, otherwise `tmp` remains the last valid character assigned, and `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times concatenated with `tmp` and then 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.**

In simpler terms, the values of `n`, `k`, and `m` have been updated to the integers provided by the input, while all other variables remain unchanged.
