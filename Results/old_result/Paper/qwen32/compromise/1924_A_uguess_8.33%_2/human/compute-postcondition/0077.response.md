The code snippet sets the variable `cur` to 0. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 1 or 2, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet, and `cur` is 0.**
