Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times a sequence of `k` distinct characters was encountered in `s`. The current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`. `cur` is the bitmask of characters encountered in the final segment of `s` that did not complete a sequence of `k` distinct characters.**
