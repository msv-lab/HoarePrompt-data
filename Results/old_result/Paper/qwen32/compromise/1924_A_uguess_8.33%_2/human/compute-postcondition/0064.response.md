Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `i` is 0, `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of the character `ss` in the alphabet. If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the `k`-th letter in the alphabet, and `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times concatenated with `tmp` and then 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, and the values of `cur` and `tmp` remain unchanged.**
