To determine the output of the provided `print` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the given code snippet.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5.
- `n`, `k`, `m` are input integers.
- `s` is the input string.
- `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` and `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.
- `cur` is initialized to 0.
- `tmp` is the `k`-th letter in the alphabet if `cnt` is 0, otherwise the last valid character assigned.
- `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times concatenated with `tmp` and then 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.
- The condition `(cnt >= n)` is true.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, `tmp`, and `ans` are not used in this particular `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of these variables and simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
