The only variable in the loop head is `ss`, which represents each character in the string `s` as the loop iterates over it. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on adjusting `ss` to the next character in the string `s`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5.
- `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers.
- `s` is a non-empty input string.
- `cur_ss` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`.
- If `cur` was originally equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0.
- `cur` retains its original value.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ss` would have been the last character processed from the string `s`. To execute the loop one more time, `ss` needs to be the next character in the string `s`.

Let's denote the current index of `ss` in the string `s` as `i`. At the end of the previous iteration, `ss` was `s[i]`. For the next iteration, `ss` should be `s[i+1]`.

Since the problem does not provide the current index `i`, we can assume that `ss` was the character at the start of the string in the first iteration. Therefore, if `ss` was `s[0]` in the first iteration, then in the next iteration, `ss` should be `s[1]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[1]) - ord('a')`. If `cur` was originally equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0. `cur` retains its original value. `ss` is the second character of `s`**
