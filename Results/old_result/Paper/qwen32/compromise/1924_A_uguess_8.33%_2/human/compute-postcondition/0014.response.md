Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`. If `cur` was originally equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0. `cur` retains its original value.**
