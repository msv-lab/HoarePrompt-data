Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty input string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the current character, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cnt` remains as per the conditions described. If `cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.**
