The only variable in the loop head is `ss`, and it iterates over each character in the string `s`. Therefore, the state of `s` is the only one that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, the string `s` must have at least one character for the loop to execute.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0**
