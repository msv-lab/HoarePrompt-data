The code snippet updates the value of the variable `ans` by setting it to the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times. The other variables remain unchanged.

The `k`-th letter in the alphabet is determined by `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`. Since `ans` is initially defined as a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times concatenated with `tmp` and then 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times, the new assignment to `ans` simply removes the parts involving `tmp` and the 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` and `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is '', and `ans` is the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times.**
