Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, 1 <= `k` <= 26, and 1 <= `m` <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the input, which is an integer. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `m`, and `s`) retain their initial states as described in the precondition.
