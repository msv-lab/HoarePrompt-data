lst is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of elements (n) in a test case followed by n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99) representing the elements of the array for that test case. The length of lst is 2 * t + 1, where t is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) and each n satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 50.
