### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their constituent digits.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program and its logic:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `list1`.

2. **Transformation Logic**:
   - The program iterates through the array, checking each pair of adjacent elements.
   - If the current element `list1[p-1]` is greater than the next element `list1[p]` and `list1[p-1]` is at least 10, it splits `list1[p-1]` into its digits and inserts them back into the array at the same position.
   - This is done by removing the element `list1[p-1]` and inserting `list1[p-1] // 10` and `list1[p-1] % 10` at the same position.

3. **Check Sorted Order**:
   - After attempting to make the array sorted by performing the above transformations, the program calls `func_1(lst)` to check if the array is sorted.
   - `func_1(lst)` compares the input list `lst` with its sorted version `sorted_lst`. If they are equal, the function returns `True`, indicating that the array is sorted. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Output**:
   - Based on the result from `func_1(lst)`, the program prints "YES" if the array can be sorted, otherwise it prints "NO".

### Analysis:
- The current implementation of the transformation logic is flawed. The program only performs a single pass through the array and splits elements when it encounters an inversion (i.e., when `list1[p-1] > list1[p]` and `list1[p-1] >= 10`). However, this approach does not guarantee that the array will be sorted after a single pass. Multiple passes may be required to resolve all inversions.
- For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`. The program will split `12` into `1` and `2`, resulting in `[1, 2, 28, 5]`. However, it will not split `28` because `2` is not greater than `28`. After this pass, the array is still not sorted, but the program will incorrectly report it as sorted.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operations. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Response:
Reasoning: The program does not correctly handle multiple transformations needed to sort the array. It only performs a single pass and may incorrectly report an array as sorted.
Correctness: **False**
