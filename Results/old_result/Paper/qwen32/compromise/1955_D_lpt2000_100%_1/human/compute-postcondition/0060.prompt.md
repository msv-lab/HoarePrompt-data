Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `nabors` is 1; `aa` is a list of strings read from the input; `bb` is a list of strings read from the next line of input; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of the elements in `bb`; `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`; `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`; `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`; `C` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`; `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` ≥ `k` else 0.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            pairs_in_D -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        D[in_aa] += 1
        pairs_in_D += 1
        C[in_aa] -= 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and `m < n`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `nabors` is 1; `aa` is a list of strings; `bb` is a list of strings; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of the elements in `bb`; `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`; `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`; `C` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`; `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` ≥ `k` else 0; `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` ≥ `k` else it remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and `m < n`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `nabors` is 1; `aa` is a list of strings; `bb` is a list of strings; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of the elements in `bb`; `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`; `C` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`; `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` ≥ `k` else it remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and `m < n`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `nabors` is 1; `aa` is a list of strings; `bb` is a list of strings; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of the elements in `bb`; `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`; `C` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`; `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` ≥ `k` else it remains unchanged; `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]` after the current `in_aa`; `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]` after the current `out_aa`. If `D[out_aa]` > 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
