The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` from the initial state to the value provided by the input. Other variables like `t`, `a`, `mdx`, and `res` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. If `n` equals 1, the list `a` contains exactly one integer. Otherwise, `mdx` remains `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and `res` is the count of elements from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.**
