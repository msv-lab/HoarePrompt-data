Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is the sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, if `n` equals 1, the list `a` contains exactly one integer, otherwise, `res` is 1 if `a[mdx]` equals `a[i]`, otherwise `res` remains 0.**
