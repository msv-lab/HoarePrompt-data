Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- The initial state provides the values of three variables:
  - `j` is 1
  - `n` is 1
  - `r` is 1

- The print statement is:
  ```python
  print(2, j % n, end=' ')
  ```

- Breaking down the print statement:
  - The first argument is the integer `2`.
  - The second argument is the expression `j % n`. Here, `j` is 1 and `n` is 1, so `j % n` evaluates to `1 % 1`, which is `0`.
  - The `end=' '` argument specifies that the output should end with a space instead of the default newline character.

- Therefore, the print statement will output the integer `2`, followed by the result of `j % n` (which is `0`), with a space at the end.

Output: **2 0 **
