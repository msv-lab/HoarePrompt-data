To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables `sum` and `r` based on the value of `n`.

The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. For each iteration, it checks if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. If true, it sets `r` to `i` and adds `n * (n + 1) // 2` to `sum`. If false, it simply adds `i * n` to `sum`.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initial State**: `sum = 0`, `r = 0`, `n` is an input integer, `t > 0` (though `t` is not used in the loop, it remains unchanged).

2. **Loop Execution**:
    - The loop runs `n` times, from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
    - For each `i`, it checks the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
    - If the condition is true, `r` is set to `i` and `sum` is incremented by `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
    - If the condition is false, `sum` is incremented by `i * n`.
    - The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` simplifies to `n + 1 > 2 * i` or `i < (n + 1) / 2`.

3. **Final State**:
    - The loop will run `n` times, and for each `i` where `i < (n + 1) / 2`, `sum` will be incremented by `n * (n + 1) // 2` and `r` will be set to `i`.
    - For each `i` where `i >= (n + 1) / 2`, `sum` will be incremented by `i * n`.
    - The final value of `r` will be the last `i` for which `i < (n + 1) / 2`, or `0` if no such `i` exists.
    - The final value of `sum` will be the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for `i < (n + 1) / 2` and `i * n` for `i >= (n + 1) / 2`.

Let's calculate the final `sum` and `r`:

- `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for `i < (n + 1) / 2` and `i * n` for `i >= (n + 1) / 2`.
- `r` is the last `i` for which `i < (n + 1) / 2`, or `0` if no such `i` exists.

The final `sum` can be calculated as:
\[ \text{sum} = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor \cdot \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} + \sum_{i=\left\lceil \frac{n+1}{2} \right\rceil}^{n} i \cdot n \]

The final `r` is:
\[ r = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor \]

Here is the final output state in the required format:

Output State: **sum is the sum of the series as described, and r is the floor of n/2.**

In simpler terms, `sum` is the total accumulated value after all iterations, and `r` is the last index where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` was true, or `0` if no such index exists.
