The only variables in the loop head are `j`, `n`, and `r`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `j` in `range(1, n + r + 1)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is 1, and `r` is 0. The loop condition `j <= n` is evaluated, and since `j` is equal to `n`, the loop body is executed. However, since there is no change to the values of `j`, `n`, or `r` within the loop, the next iteration would again have `j` equal to 1, and the condition `j <= n` would still be true, causing the loop to execute again. 

To ensure the loop does not execute again, `j` needs to be incremented to a value greater than `n`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, we need to adjust `j` to be 2 (which is greater than `n`).

Therefore, for the loop to not execute one more time, `j` should be 2, `n` should remain 1, and `r` should remain 0.

State: **`j` is 2, `n` is 1, `r` is 0**
