To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
- `sum = n * (n + 1) // 2`: This is the formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. However, the value of `sum` is not directly used in the print statement.
- `r = 1`: This variable is defined but not used in the print statement.
- `n` must be at least 0: This indicates that `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `j = n + 1`: This variable is defined but not used in the print statement.

### Print Statement:
```
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```
The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print all integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). The `*` operator unpacks the range object, so the numbers will be printed separated by spaces.

### Explanation:
- Since `n` is a non-negative integer, `range(1, n + 1)` will generate numbers starting from 1 up to `n`.
- If `n` is 0, the range will be empty, and nothing will be printed.
- If `n` is 1, the range will be [1], and the output will be `1`.
- If `n` is 2, the range will be [1, 2], and the output will be `1 2`.
- If `n` is 3, the range will be [1, 2, 3], and the output will be `1 2 3`, and so on.

### Output Description:
Given that `n` is at least 0, the output will be a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`, separated by spaces. If `n` is 0, the output will be empty.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is a non-negative integer representing the number of terms to print)**

If `n` is 0, Output: **(nothing)**

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is a non-negative integer representing the number of terms to print)**
