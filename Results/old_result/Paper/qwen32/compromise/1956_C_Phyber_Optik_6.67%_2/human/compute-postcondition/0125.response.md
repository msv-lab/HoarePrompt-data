Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `j` is 1
- `n` is 1
- `r` is 1

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Explanation:
The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n + 1`. Given that `n` is 1, the range will be `range(1, 2)`.

- `range(1, 2)` generates the sequence `[1]`.
- The `*` operator in the `print` function unpacks this sequence, so the numbers in the sequence are printed as individual arguments to `print`.

### Output:
Since the range is `[1]`, unpacking and printing this sequence will output the number 1.

Output: **1**
