Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Variable Initialization:**
   - `sum = n * (n + 1) // 2`: This formula calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. However, the value of `sum` is not used in the print statement.
   - `r = 1`: This variable is initialized to 1, but it is not used in the print statement.
   - `n` must be at least 0: This indicates the minimum value of `n`.
   - `j` is greater than `n`: This indicates that `j` is some integer value greater than `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - `print(2, j % n, end=' ')`: This statement prints two values separated by a space, followed by an empty space (due to `end=' '`).

3. **Values to Print:**
   - The first value to be printed is `2`, which is a constant.
   - The second value to be printed is `j % n`, which is the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`.

4. **Description of `j % n`:**
   - Since `j` is greater than `n`, `j % n` will be a value between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive). The exact value depends on the specific values of `j` and `n`.

Given the information, the print statement will output the constant `2` followed by the remainder of `j` divided by `n`.

Output: **2, j % n (where j % n is the remainder when j is divided by n)**
