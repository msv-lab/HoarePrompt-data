Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the size of an n × n matrix filled with zeroes. It processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5. For each test case, it returns the n × n matrix filled with zeroes.**
