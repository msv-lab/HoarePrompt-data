The code snippet `sum += i * n` modifies the value of the `sum` variable by adding `i * n` to it. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the code. Here's the updated state:

- `j` remains `n + r`.
- `sum` is updated to either `(2 * (n * (n + 1) // 2)) + i * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` was greater than `i * n` initially, or `(i * n + n * (n + 1) // 2) + i * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` was less than or equal to `i * n` initially.
- `n` remains greater than or equal to 1.
- `r` remains `i` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` was greater than `i * n` initially, or `r` is either `i` or `0` depending on the condition.
- `i` is `i + 1`, but since the code snippet does not modify `i`, we keep it as `i` for the output state description.

Output State: **`j` is `n + r`; `sum` is either `(2 * (n * (n + 1) // 2)) + i * n` or `(i * n + n * (n + 1) // 2) + i * n`; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `r` is `i` or either `i` or `0` depending on the condition; `i` is `i + 1`.**
