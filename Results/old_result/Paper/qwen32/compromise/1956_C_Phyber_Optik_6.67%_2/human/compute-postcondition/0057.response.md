The code snippet `sum += i * n` increments the value of `sum` by `i * n`. Given the initial state, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n`, and `r` is either `i` or `0` based on the comparison `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 before the code snippet is executed.

Let's update the value of `sum`:
- If `sum` was `n * (n + 1) // 2`, then `sum` becomes `n * (n + 1) // 2 + i * n`.
- If `sum` was `i * n`, then `sum` becomes `i * n + i * n = 2 * i * n`.

The values of `n`, `t`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 before the code snippet, so the incremented value of `i` is used in the calculation of `sum`.

Output State: **`sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + i * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, otherwise `sum` is `2 * i * n`; `r` is `i` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, otherwise `r` is `0`; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `t` is greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1.**
