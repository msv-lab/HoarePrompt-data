To determine the output, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `sum = n * (n + 1) // 2`: This is the formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. However, the value of `sum` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
2. `r = 1`: The variable `r` is set to 1, but it is not used in the print statement, so we can also ignore it.
3. `n` must be at least 0: This means `n` is a non-negative integer.
4. `j = n + 1`: The variable `j` is set to `n + 1`.

### Print Statement:
```
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The first argument to `print` is the integer `2`.
- The second argument to `print` is `j % n`. Given that `j = n + 1`, we can substitute `j` with `n + 1` in the expression `j % n`.
- `j % n` translates to `(n + 1) % n`. The modulus operation `(n + 1) % n` will always yield `1` for any `n > 0` because `n + 1` is exactly one more than `n`, and the remainder when `n + 1` is divided by `n` is `1`.
- If `n = 0`, the expression `(n + 1) % n` becomes `1 % 0`, which would normally cause a division by zero error. However, since the problem states that `n` must be at least 0, and typically such problems assume valid inputs, we can infer that `n` is at least 1 in practical terms to avoid this error.

### Conclusion:
- The print statement will output `2` followed by the result of `(n + 1) % n`, which is `1` for any `n > 0`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2 1**
