To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code snippet step by step.

### Given Information:
- `sum` is the sum of a series (though it is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is at least 2.
- `r` is the floor of `n/2`.
- `j` is `j + 1`, ensuring `j` is less than `n + r + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `2`:** This is a constant integer value and will always be printed as `2`.

2. **Value of `j % n`:**
   - `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and it is ensured that `j` remains less than `n + r + 1`.
   - `r` is the floor of `n/2`, so `r = floor(n/2)`.
   - The expression `j % n` computes the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`.

   Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration and `j` is less than `n + r + 1`, the value of `j` can range from 1 to `n + r` (exclusive of `n + r + 1`).

   Given that `r` is at least 1 (since `n` is at least 2), `j` can take values from 1 to `n + floor(n/2) - 1`. The value of `j % n` will therefore range from 0 to `n-1`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the constant value `2` followed by the value of `j % n` (which is the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`).

Since the exact value of `j` is not specified, we can only describe it in terms of its possible range and the operation applied to it.

Output: **2, j % n (where j is a value such that 1 <= j < n + floor(n/2) + 1)**
