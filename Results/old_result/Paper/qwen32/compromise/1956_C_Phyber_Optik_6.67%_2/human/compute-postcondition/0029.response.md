To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `sum = n * (n + 1) // 2`: This is the formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
   - `r = 1`: This variable is defined but not used in the print statement.
   - `n` must be at least 0: This means `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `j` is greater than `n`: This variable is also defined but not used in the print statement.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - `print(*range(1, n + 1))`: This statement will print the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), each separated by a space.

3. **Determining the Output:**
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` inclusive.
   - The `*` operator in the `print` statement unpacks this sequence, so each number in the sequence is printed separately.

Given that `n` is a non-negative integer, the output will be the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (if `n` is greater than 0). If `n` is 0, the `range(1, 0 + 1)` will be an empty sequence, and nothing will be printed.

Let's summarize the output based on the value of `n`:
- If `n` is 0, Output: **(nothing)**
- If `n` is 1, Output: **1**
- If `n` is 2, Output: **1 2**
- If `n` is 3, Output: **1 2 3**
- and so on...

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, the most precise description we can provide is:

Output: **1 2 ... n (where n is a non-negative integer)**

However, if we need to provide a specific case, we can assume the general form. For the sake of completeness and since `n` is not specified, we should consider the general case where `n` can be any non-negative integer.

Output: **1 2 ... n (where n is a non-negative integer)**

If we need to provide a specific example, let's assume `n` is 5 for clarity:

Output: **1 2 3 4 5**
