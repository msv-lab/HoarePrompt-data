To determine the output of the provided `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the values of the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `sum` is the sum of a series, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `n` is at least 2.
- `r` is the floor of `n/2`.
- `j` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, ensuring `j` is less than `n + r + 1`.

### Variables in the Print Statement:
- The print statement is `print(2, j % n, end=' ')`. This means it will print the integer `2`, followed by the result of `j % n`, and the `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output does not end with a newline but with a space instead.

### Value Analysis:
- `2` is a constant and will always be printed as `2`.
- `j % n` means the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`. The value of `j` is not explicitly given, but we know it is incremented by 1 each time and is less than `n + r + 1`.

### Output Determination:
Since the exact value of `j` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `j` and `n`. The output will be `2` followed by the remainder of `j` divided by `n`, separated by a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **2, j % n (where j is the current value of j and n is at least 2)**
