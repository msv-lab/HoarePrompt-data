To determine what will be printed by the `print(sum, n + r)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the relationships between the variables:

1. **Variable Definitions:**
   - `j` is defined as `n + r`.
   - `sum` is the accumulated sum as described, but the description of how `sum` is accumulated is not provided, so we'll treat it as a variable with an unknown explicit value.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `i < (n + 1) / 2`.

2. **Determine `r`:**
   - `r` is the largest integer less than `(n + 1) / 2`.
   - If `n` is odd, `(n + 1) / 2` is an integer, and `r` will be one less than this integer.
   - If `n` is even, `(n + 1) / 2` is not an integer, and `r` will be the integer part of `(n + 1) / 2`.

3. **Calculate `n + r`:**
   - Since `r` is the largest integer less than `(n + 1) / 2`, `n + r` can be described based on the value of `n`.

### Example Walkthrough:

- **If `n` is odd (e.g., `n = 5`):**
  - `(n + 1) / 2 = (5 + 1) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3`.
  - `r` is the largest integer less than 3, so `r = 2`.
  - `n + r = 5 + 2 = 7`.

- **If `n` is even (e.g., `n = 6`):**
  - `(n + 1) / 2 = (6 + 1) / 2 = 7 / 2 = 3.5`.
  - `r` is the largest integer less than 3.5, so `r = 3`.
  - `n + r = 6 + 3 = 9`.

### General Description:

- `r` is the largest integer less than `(n + 1) / 2`.
- `n + r` can be precisely described as `n + (the largest integer less than (n + 1) / 2)`.

### Output:

Given the above, the output will be:
Output: **sum, n + r (where sum is the accumulated sum and r is the largest integer less than (n + 1) / 2)**
