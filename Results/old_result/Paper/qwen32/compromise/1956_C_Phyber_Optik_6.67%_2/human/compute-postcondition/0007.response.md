The code snippet `sum += n * (n + 1) // 2` updates the value of `sum` by adding the result of `n * (n + 1) // 2` to it. The variables `t`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged. The condition `(n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n)` is still true based on the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `sum` is `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2`; `r` is `i`; the condition `(n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n)` is true.**
