The code snippet assigns the value `0` to both `sum` and `r`. The initial state specifies that `sum` is a value based on the previous `n`, `r` is `1`, `n` is an input integer, and `t` must be greater than `0`. After executing the code, `sum` and `r` are updated to `0`. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`sum` is 0, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0.**
