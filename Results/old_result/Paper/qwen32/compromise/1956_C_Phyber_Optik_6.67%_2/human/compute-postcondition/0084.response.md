Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `sum` is the sum of a series (not directly relevant to the print statement).
- `n` is at least 2.
- `r` is the floor of `n/2` (not directly relevant to the print statement).
- `j` is `j + 1`, ensuring `j` is less than `n + r + 1` (not directly relevant to the print statement).

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement uses the `*` operator to unpack the elements of the `range(1, n + 1)` and prints them. The `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` inclusive.

Since `n` is at least 2, the `range(1, n + 1)` will generate numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Example:
If `n` is 2, the `range(1, n + 1)` will generate the numbers 1 and 2.
If `n` is 3, the `range(1, n + 1)` will generate the numbers 1, 2, and 3.
If `n` is 10, the `range(1, n + 1)` will generate the numbers 1 through 10.

### General Output:
The `print` statement will output all integers from 1 to `n`, separated by spaces.

### Conclusion:
Output: **1 2 ... n (where n is at least 2)**

This output represents the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`, inclusive, with each number separated by a space.
