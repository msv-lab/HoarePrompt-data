The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n` (and indirectly `r`, which is a function of `n`). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the range defined by `n` and `r`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is either less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n + r + 1`.

Since `r` is the floor of `n / 2`, `n + r + 1` is the upper limit for `j`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that `j` is either less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n` at the end of the previous iteration, if `j` is less than `n + r + 1`, it will be incremented by 1 to start the next iteration.

Let's assume `j` is at the value it had at the end of the previous iteration. For the loop to continue, we increment `j` by 1.

State: **`sum` is the sum of the series as described, `n` is at least 2, `r` is the floor of `n/2` (which will be at least 1 if `n` is at least 2), and `j` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, ensuring `j` is less than `n + r + 1`**.

Since we do not have the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, we can only state that `j` is incremented by 1 and should be less than `n + r + 1` for the loop to continue.

State: **`sum` is the sum of the series as described, `n` is at least 2, `r` is the floor of `n/2`, and `j` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, ensuring `j` is less than `n + r + 1`**.
