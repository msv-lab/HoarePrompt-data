The `print` statement is given as `print(1, j, end=' ')`. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of what will be printed:

1. The first argument in the `print` function is the integer `1`.
2. The second argument is the variable `j`, which has been explicitly stated in the initial state to be `1`.
3. The `end=' '` argument specifies that the print statement should end with a space instead of the default newline character.

Given these elements, the `print` statement will output the integer `1`, followed by the value of `j` (which is `1`), separated by a space, and the entire output will end with a space instead of a newline.

Output: **1 1 **
