The variable `sum` is incremented by the value of `i * n`. Given that `i` is 4, the new value of `sum` will be the previous value of `sum` plus `4 * n`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 4; `sum` is increased by `4 * n`.**
