The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and its relationship with `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

Let's break down the state adjustments:
- `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the range.

Given the conditions:
- If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` initially, `sum` is `2 * n * (n + 1) // 2` and `r` is `i`.
- Otherwise, `sum` is `i * n + n * (n + 1) // 2` and `r` is `0`.

However, the values of `sum` and `r` do not affect the loop's continuation, so they don't need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. The only thing we need to adjust is `i`.

State: **`sum` is either `2 * n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` initially, or `i * n + n * (n + 1) // 2` otherwise, `r` is `i` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, otherwise `r` is `0`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is greater than 0, and `i` is incremented by 1. Adjusted State: `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration.**

So, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`.

State: **`sum` is either `2 * n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` initially, or `i * n + n * (n + 1) // 2` otherwise, `r` is `i` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, otherwise `r` is `0`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is greater than 0, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
