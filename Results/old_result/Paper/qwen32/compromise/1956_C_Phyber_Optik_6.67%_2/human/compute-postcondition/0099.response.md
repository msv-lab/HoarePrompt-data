The code snippet `sum += n * (n + 1) // 2` adds the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2` to the current value of `sum`. 

Given the initial state, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, or `i * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`. 

After the operation, `sum` will be the previous value of `sum` plus `n * (n + 1) // 2`. Therefore, the new value of `sum` will be:

- If `n * (n + 1) // 2` was greater than `i * n` initially, `sum` becomes `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2 = 2 * (n * (n + 1) // 2)`.
- If `n * (n + 1) // 2` was less than or equal to `i * n` initially, `sum` becomes `i * n + n * (n + 1) // 2`.

The values of `j`, `n`, `r`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`j` is `n + r`, `sum` is either `2 * (n * (n + 1) // 2)` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` was greater than `i * n` initially, or `i * n + n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` was less than or equal to `i * n` initially, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `r` is `i`, `i` is `i + 1`.**
