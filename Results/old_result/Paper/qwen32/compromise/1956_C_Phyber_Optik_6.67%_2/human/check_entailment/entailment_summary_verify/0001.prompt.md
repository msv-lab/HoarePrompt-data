You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        (sum, r) = (0, 0)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:
                r = i
                sum += n * (n + 1) // 2
            else:
                sum += i * n
        print(sum, n + r)
        for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
            if j <= n:
                print(1, j, end=' ')
                print(*range(1, n + 1))
            else:
                print(2, j % n, end=' ')
                print(*range(1, n + 1))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` representing the size of an `n × n` matrix. For each test case, it calculates a sum and a value `r`, then prints the sum and `n + r`. It also prints a sequence of commands that involve printing rows of the matrix. The function does not modify the matrix itself but outputs a series of commands that could be used to fill or manipulate the matrix.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires maximizing the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with zeros by performing a limited number of operations (no more than \( 2n \)). The operations involve filling rows or columns with permutations of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

### Key Points:
1. **Type 1 Operation**: Fill the \( i \)-th row with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
2. **Type 2 Operation**: Fill the \( i \)-th column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

The goal is to maximize the sum of the matrix elements, and the optimal strategy involves filling the matrix with the highest possible values in each row and column.

### Optimal Strategy:
- The maximum sum can be achieved by filling the matrix such that each row and each column contains the numbers 1 through \( n \) exactly once. This ensures that each element in the matrix is part of a permutation.
- The maximum possible sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \), which is the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers, repeated \( n \) times (once for each row).

### Implementation Analysis:
Let's break down the provided code:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).

2. **Calculating the Sum:**
   - The code initializes `sum` to 0 and `r` to 0.
   - It then iterates from 1 to \( n \) and calculates the sum. However, the logic seems incorrect:
     - The condition `if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is not appropriate for calculating the maximum sum.
     - The sum should be calculated as `n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)` for the entire matrix.

3. **Printing the Result:**
   - The number of operations `m` is calculated as `n + r`, which is not correct.
   - The operations are printed in a loop, but the logic for the operations is incorrect:
     - It prints a type 1 operation for the first \( n \) rows.
     - It prints a type 2 operation for the remaining operations, but the row/column index and permutation are not correctly managed.

### Correctness:
Given the incorrect logic in calculating the sum and the operations, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
