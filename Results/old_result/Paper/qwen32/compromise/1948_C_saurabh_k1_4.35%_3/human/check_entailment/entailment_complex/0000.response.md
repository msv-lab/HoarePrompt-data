### Reasoning:
The program's logic is based on a specific condition for determining if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). According to the provided annotated program, the decision is made solely based on whether the second last character of the second row of the grid (b[n - 2]) is a '<'. If it is, the program outputs "No", otherwise it outputs "Yes".

However, this logic does not fully capture the problem's requirements. The problem involves a robot that can move in four possible directions and must follow the arrows in the grid. The robot's movement depends on its ability to navigate through the grid according to the rules stated, and the solution should consider the possibility of moving between rows and following arrows correctly.

The given program does not account for the possibility of the robot moving between rows and following arrows to reach the target cell (2, n). It only checks the direction of the second last arrow in the second row, which is an oversimplification and does not guarantee correctness.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
