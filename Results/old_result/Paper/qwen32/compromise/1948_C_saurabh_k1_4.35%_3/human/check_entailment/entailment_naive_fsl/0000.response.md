Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given grid of arrows. The program only checks if the last arrow in the second row is pointing to the left (`<`). If it is, the program outputs "No", otherwise it outputs "Yes". This is clearly insufficient for solving the problem as it does not consider the actual path that the robot can take through the grid.

Let's consider a counterexample where the program would fail:

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
1
4
><><
><><
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

Explanation of the Counterexample:
- The robot starts at (1, 1).
- It can move to (1, 2) and then follow the arrow to (1, 1) again.
- It can continue moving and following arrows but will never reach (2, 4).

However, the program would output "YES" for this input because the last arrow in the second row is `>`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle the problem requirements correctly for all potential cases.
