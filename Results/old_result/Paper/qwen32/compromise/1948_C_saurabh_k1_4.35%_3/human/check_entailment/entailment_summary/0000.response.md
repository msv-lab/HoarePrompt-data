Reasoning:
The given program checks if the second last character of the second row of the grid is a '<'. If it is, the program outputs 'No', indicating that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n). Otherwise, it outputs 'Yes'.

However, this logic is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the problem description. The problem requires simulating the robot's movement according to the rules provided, which involves moving left, right, down, or up, and then following the arrow in the current cell.

The provided program does not simulate the robot's movement. It only checks a specific condition (the second last character of the second row) and makes a decision based on that, which is not a comprehensive solution to the problem.

For example, consider the third test case in the example input:
```
4
>>><
>><<
```
Here, the second last character of the second row is '<', so the program would output 'No'. However, if we simulate the robot's movement, we can see that it can indeed reach (2, 4) by following this path: (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4).

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not accurately determine if the robot can reach the target cell based on the provided rules.

Correctness: **False**
