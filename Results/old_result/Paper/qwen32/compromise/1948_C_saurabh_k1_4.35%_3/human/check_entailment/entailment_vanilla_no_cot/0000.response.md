Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n). The logic in the program is too simplistic and does not account for the robot's movement and the direction of the arrows in the grid.

The program only checks if the second last arrow in the second row is pointing to the left. If it is, the program incorrectly concludes that the robot cannot reach (2, n). However, the robot can still reach (2, n) from other positions or if the arrows in other rows or columns allow it.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to simulate the robot's movement according to the rules provided, taking into account all the arrows in both rows and ensuring that the robot can reach the target cell (2, n) from its starting position (1, 1).
