### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the function summary provided to determine if the program is correct based on the problem description.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary provided for `func_1` is incorrect. According to the problem description and the code, `func_1` is supposed to update the position of a player based on the movement direction. Specifically, it takes a tuple `a` representing the current position `(x, y)` and a tuple `b` representing the movement `(dx, dy)`, and returns the new position `(x + dx, y + dy)`.

However, the summary states that `func_1` takes two lists of strings and concatenates corresponding elements, which is not the case here. This discrepancy in the function summary should be noted, but it does not directly affect the correctness of the program's logic regarding the problem's requirements.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - The program correctly initializes the field dimensions, player positions, goal positions, movement directions, and scores.

2. **Field Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the field to identify players and goals and stores their positions.

3. **Moves Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of moves and processes each move.
   - For movement actions (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`), it uses `func_1` to update the player's position.
   - For throw actions (`T`), it checks if the player is at a goal and updates the score accordingly.

4. **Quaffle Handling:**
   - The program does not track the Quaffle's position explicitly.
   - It does not update the Quaffle's position when a player catches or throws it.
   - It does not reset the Quaffle's position to the center after a goal is scored.

5. **Goal Scoring:**
   - The program checks if the player is at a goal to determine scoring.
   - However, it does not check if the player is carrying the Quaffle before allowing a throw and scoring.
   - It increments the score for the correct team based on the goal's type (red or blue), but it does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal correctly.

6. **Logical Errors:**
   - The program does not check if the player is carrying the Quaffle before allowing a throw.
   - It does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal correctly (i.e., it should award the point to the opposing team).

Given these issues, the program is not fully correct. Specifically, it fails to handle the Quaffle correctly and does not properly manage the goal scoring logic, especially when a player scores in their own goal.

### Final Evaluation:
**Final: False**

The program is incorrect due to the issues in handling the Quaffle and the incorrect goal scoring logic.
