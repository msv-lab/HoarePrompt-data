Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, which is a list of strings representing the field with the first line containing two integers N and M (3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99, and both are odd), and `b`, which is a list of strings describing actions performed by an entity. The function returns a tuple where the first element is the string `x` concatenated with the integer `dx`, and the second element is the string `y` concatenated with the integer `dy`.**
