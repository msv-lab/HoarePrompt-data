#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of strings representing the field, where each string contains pairs of characters separated by spaces. The first line of a contains two integers N and M (3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99, and both are odd). The subsequent N lines each contain M pairs of characters representing the field's initial state. b is a list of strings, where each string describes an action performed by an entity in the format specified in the problem description. The number of actions in b is T (0 ≤ T ≤ 10000).
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns a tuple where the first element is the string `x` concatenated with the integer `dx`, and the second element is the string `y` concatenated with the integer `dy`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, which is a list of strings, and `b`, which is also a list of strings. The function returns a tuple where the first element is the first string from `a` concatenated with the first string from `b`, and the second element is the second string from `a` concatenated with the second string from `b`.
