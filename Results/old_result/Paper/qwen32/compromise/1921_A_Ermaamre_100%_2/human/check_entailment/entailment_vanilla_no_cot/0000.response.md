Correctness: **False**

The provided program assumes that the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates will give the side length of the square, which is not always correct. The side length of the square could also be the difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates. The program should consider both the x and y coordinates to determine the side length of the square.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
        x = [p[0] for p in a]
        y = [p[1] for p in a]
        dx = max(x) - min(x)
        dy = max(y) - min(y)
        side_length = max(dx, dy)
        print(side_length * side_length)

func()
```

This version of the program correctly calculates the side length of the square by considering both the x and y coordinates.
