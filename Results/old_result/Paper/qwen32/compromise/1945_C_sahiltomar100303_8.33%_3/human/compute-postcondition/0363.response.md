Postcondition: **`n` is 2, `left` is 0, `leftZero` is -1 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 0, `rightZero` is 0 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 0, `rightOne` is 1 if `s[0] is '1' otherwise unchanged, `right` is 1. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is 2 if `s[1]` is '0' otherwise 3, and `trightOne` is 1 if `s[1]` is '1' otherwise 0, and `tleftOne` is 0 if `s[1]` is '0' otherwise 1. If `s[right]` is not '0', then `tleftZero` is 1 if `s[1]` is '0' otherwise 2, `trightOne` is 0 if `s[1]` is '1' otherwise 0, and `tleftOne` is 1 if `s[1]` is '0' otherwise 2.**
