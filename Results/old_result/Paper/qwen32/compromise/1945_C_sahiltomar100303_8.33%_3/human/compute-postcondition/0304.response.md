Output State: **`mid` must be less than `n`, `i` is `i + 1`, `rightZero` is `rightZero + 2`**

Explanation: The value of `trightZero` is incremented by 1, but since `trightZero` is the same as `rightZero` in this context, `rightZero` is effectively incremented by 2 (once from its initial increment and once from the code execution). The values of `mid`, `i`, and the condition that `mid` must be less than `n` remain unchanged.
