The value of `leftOne` is decremented by 1. Since the initial value of `leftOne` is not provided, we only know it is being decreased by 1. The other variables (`n`, `left`, `leftZero`, `rightOne`, and the character at index `left - 1` in the string `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 2, `left` is 1, `leftZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `leftOne` is decreased by 1, and the character at index `left - 1` in the string `s` is not '0'**.
