Postcondition: **`n` is 2, `left` is 1. If the character at index 0 of `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is -2 if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is -1, and `rightZero` is 2 if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` is 1. If the character at index 0 of `s` is not '0', then `leftZero` is -1 if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is decreased by 1, and `rightOne` is increased by 1.**
