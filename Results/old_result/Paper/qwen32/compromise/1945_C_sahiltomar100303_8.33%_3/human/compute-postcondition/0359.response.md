Output State: **`n` is 2, `left` is 0, `leftZero` is -1 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 0, `rightZero` is 1 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 0, `rightOne` is 1 if `s[0] is '1' otherwise unchanged, `right` is 1, `tleftZero` is 2 if `s[1]` is '0' otherwise 3, `trightOne` is 1 if `s[1]` is '1' otherwise 0, and `tleftOne` is 0 if `s[1]` is '0' otherwise 1.**

Explanation: The value of `tleftZero` is incremented by 1. If `s[1]` is '0', `tleftZero` was initially 1 and becomes 2. If `s[1]` is not '0', `tleftZero` was initially 2 and becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
