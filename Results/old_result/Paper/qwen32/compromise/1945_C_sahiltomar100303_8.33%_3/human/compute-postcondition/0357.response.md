Output State: **`n` is 2, `left` is 0, `leftZero` is -1 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 0, `rightZero` is 1 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 0, `rightOne` is 1 if `s[0]` is '1' otherwise unchanged, `right` is 2, `tleftZero` is 2 if `s[right]` is '0' otherwise 1, `trightOne` is 0 if `s[right]` is '0' otherwise 0, and `tleftOne` is 1 if `s[right]` is '1' otherwise 0.**

Explanation: The value of `right` is incremented by 1, so `right` changes from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
