Postcondition: **n is 2, right is 2, left is not 0, leftZero is -1 if s[0] is '0' otherwise 0, rightZero is 1 if s[0] is '0' otherwise 0, rightOne is 1 if s[0] is '1' otherwise unchanged, tleftZero is 2 if s[1] is '0' otherwise 1, trightZero is 0 if s[1] is '0' otherwise 0, tleftOne is 1 if s[1] is '1' otherwise 0, trightOne is 0 if s[1] is '0' otherwise 0, and tleftZero is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2.**
