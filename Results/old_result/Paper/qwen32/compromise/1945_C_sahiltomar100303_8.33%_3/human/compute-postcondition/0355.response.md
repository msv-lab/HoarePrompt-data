Output State: **`n` is 2, `left` is 0, `leftZero` is -1 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 0, `rightZero` is 1 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 0, `rightOne` is 1 if `s[0]` is '1' otherwise unchanged, `right` is 1, `tleftZero` is 1 if `s[right]` is '0' otherwise 0, `trightOne` is 0 if `s[right]` is '0' otherwise 0, `tleftOne` is 1**.

The value of `trightOne` has been decremented by 1, so if it was 1, it is now 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
