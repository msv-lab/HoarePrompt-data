Output State: **`t` remains `t`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input string, `mid` remains `n // 2`, `left` is either 0 or not 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `i` remains `n`, `tleftZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `leftZero` is 1, `leftOne` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, and the current character of `s` at index `i` is '0'.**

In this output state, the only change is that `leftZero` has been incremented by 1, making its value 1. All other variables retain their initial values as specified.
