Reasoning:  
The given program is incorrect. The logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not correctly determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two and rearranging the pieces.

To solve the problem, we need to consider whether the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides and then rearranged to form a new rectangle. The key insight is that this is possible if and only if at least one of the sides of the original rectangle is even. This is because if both sides are odd, the only way to cut the rectangle would result in two smaller rectangles with odd dimensions, and these cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle with integer sides.

The correct implementation should check if either `a` or `b` is even, and return 'Yes' if so, and 'No' otherwise. The provided function only checks if `b` is even, which is insufficient.

Correctness: **False**
