### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to determine the outcome of a game played on a checkered board between Alice and Bob, based on their initial positions and the rules of movement. The logic provided in the program needs to be carefully evaluated against the rules and the given examples.

1. **Base Case Handling**:
   - The program starts by checking if `xa > xb`. If Alice's initial row (`xa`) is greater than Bob's initial row (`xb`), it immediately concludes that the game is a draw. This is because, under optimal play, Alice cannot move upwards, and Bob cannot move downwards from their initial positions if Alice is already below Bob. This part is correct.

2. **Movement Analysis**:
   - If `xa <= xb`, the program calculates `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`. This value represents the maximum number of moves Alice can make vertically towards Bob's position before Bob can react similarly.
   - The program then checks whether the difference in rows is odd or even:
     - **Odd Difference**: If the difference in rows is odd, the program calculates the range of columns (`l` to `r`) where Bob's chip can be after `x` moves. It then checks if Alice can move into this range within `x + 1` moves. If she can, Alice wins; otherwise, it's a draw.
     - **Even Difference**: If the difference in rows is even, the program calculates the range of columns (`l` to `r`) where Alice's chip can be after `x` moves. It then checks if Bob can move into this range within `x` moves. If he can, Bob wins; otherwise, it's a draw.

3. **Execution Summary**:
   - The execution summary indicates that the function processes each test case correctly based on the input parameters and outputs the appropriate result ('Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob'). This aligns with the logic described in the program.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the outcome of the game based on the initial positions of Alice and Bob, the dimensions of the board, and the movement rules. The program handles both odd and even differences in row positions and calculates the possible movement ranges accurately to determine the winner or if the game will end in a draw.

**Correctness: True**
