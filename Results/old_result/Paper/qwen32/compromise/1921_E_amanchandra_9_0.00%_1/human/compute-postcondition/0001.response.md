To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand what the loop is doing. The loop processes each test case by reading six integers: `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`. It then determines the winner of a game based on the positions of two players on a grid.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
1. If `xa > xb`, the game is a draw.
2. If `xa <= xb`, the logic depends on whether the difference `abs(xa - xb)` is odd or even.
   - If the difference is odd, it calculates the range `[l, r]` for player B's y-coordinate based on the midpoint of `xa` and `xb`. It then checks if player A's y-coordinate is within this range plus one. If it is, player Alice wins; otherwise, it's a draw.
   - If the difference is even, it calculates the range `[l, r]` for player A's y-coordinate based on the midpoint of `xa` and `xb`. It then checks if player B's y-coordinate is within this range. If it is, player Bob wins; otherwise, it's a draw.

The loop processes each test case and prints the result. The variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are reset for each iteration of the loop based on the input provided.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and the initial state only specifies the number of test cases `t` and the range of values for `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`, the output state after all iterations is simply the series of printed results for each test case.

Given that the loop processes each test case and prints the result, the output state is the concatenation of the results of each test case. Since we do not have specific test cases provided, we can describe the output state in a general form.

Output State: **A series of printed results ('Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob') for each of the t test cases.**
