The code snippet `n = int(data[index])` updates the value of `n` to the integer value of the string at the position `index` in the `data` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace; `input` holds the entire input string; `index` is index + n; `T` is an integer value greater than 0 and is decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year`; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `last_year` is the final calculated year after all iterations; `i` is n - 1; `last_year` is equal to `next_year`.**
