The code snippet `n = int(data[index])` takes the string at the position specified by `index` in the list `data`, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. Given that `index` is 1, `n` will be assigned the integer value of the second element in the `data` list. The values of `data`, `input`, `T`, and `results` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace; `input` holds the entire input string; `index` is 1; `T` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**
