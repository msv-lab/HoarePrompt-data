Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace, `input` holds the entire input string, `index` is `index + n`, `T` is an integer value greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `last_year` is `(last_year // a[i] + 1) * a[i]`, `next_year` is `(last_year // a[i] + 1) * a[i]`.**

In natural language: The value of `last_year` is updated to be equal to `next_year`, which is calculated as `(last_year // a[i] + 1) * a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
