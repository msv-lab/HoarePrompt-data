The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the loop's state or iteration. The loop runs `T` times, so the only variable that needs adjustment for the loop to execute one more time is `T`.

Given that `T` is an integer value greater than 0 and represents the number of remaining iterations, we need to decrement `T` by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:
- `T` should be decremented by 1.

State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace; `input` holds the entire input string; `index` is index + n; `T` is an integer value greater than 0 and is decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year`; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `last_year` is the final calculated year after all iterations; `i` is n - 1; `last_year` is equal to `next_year`.**
