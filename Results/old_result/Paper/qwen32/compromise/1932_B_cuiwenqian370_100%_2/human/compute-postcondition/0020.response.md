Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace; `input` holds the entire input string; `index` is `index + n`; `T` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `last_year` is `(last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`; `next_year` is `(last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`; `i` is 2; `last_year` is equal to `next_year`.**

Natural Language: The value of `last_year` has been updated to be equal to `next_year`. All other variables retain their initial values or states as described.
