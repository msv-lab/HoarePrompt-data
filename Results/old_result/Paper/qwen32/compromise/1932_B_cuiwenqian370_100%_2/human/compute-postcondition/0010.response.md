The value of `index` is incremented by `n`. Therefore, the new value of `index` is `index + n`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace; `input` holds the entire input string; `index` is `index + n`; `T` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`.**
