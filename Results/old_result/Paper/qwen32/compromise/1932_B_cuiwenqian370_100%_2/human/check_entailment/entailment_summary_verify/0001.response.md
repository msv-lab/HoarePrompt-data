Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to ensure the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine the year when the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that each sign occurs at regular intervals and must occur sequentially. Specifically, if the i-th sign occurs in year `x`, the (i+1)-th sign must occur in a year `y` where `y > x` and `y` is a multiple of `a_{i+1}`.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it processes the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It then calculates the year when the n-th sign will occur using the following logic:

1. **Initialization**: The first sign occurs at the first multiple of `a_0`, which is `a_0` itself.
2. **Subsequent Signs**: For each subsequent sign, the program calculates the next possible year using the formula:
   ```python
   next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
   ```
   This formula ensures that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.

### Detailed Reasoning:
- **First Sign**: The first sign occurs at `a[0]`.
- **Subsequent Signs**: For each subsequent sign, the program calculates the next occurrence year as follows:
  - `last_year + 1` ensures we start checking from the year immediately after the previous sign occurred.
  - `a[i] - 1` is added to ensure that we round up to the next multiple of `a[i]`.
  - The expression `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` effectively computes the smallest multiple of `a[i]` greater than `last_year`.

### Validation:
Let's validate the formula with the example provided in the problem description:

1. **First Sign**: Occurs at year `3` (since `a[0] = 3`).
2. **Second Sign**: Must occur after year `3`. The smallest multiple of `2` greater than `3` is `4`.
3. **Third Sign**: Must occur after year `4`. The smallest multiple of `4` greater than `4` is `8`.
4. **Fourth Sign**: Must occur after year `8`. The smallest multiple of `5` greater than `8` is `10`.
5. **Fifth Sign**: Must occur after year `10`. The smallest multiple of `9` greater than `10` is `18`.
6. **Sixth Sign**: Must occur after year `18`. The smallest multiple of `18` greater than `18` is `36`.

This matches the expected output of `36` for the first test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur by ensuring each subsequent sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The formula used to calculate the next occurrence of each sign is correct, and the program handles multiple test cases appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
