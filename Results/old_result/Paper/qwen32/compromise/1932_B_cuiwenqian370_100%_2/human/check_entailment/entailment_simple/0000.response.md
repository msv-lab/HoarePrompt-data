### Reasoning:
The program reads the input correctly, processes each test case, and computes the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the rules provided in the problem description. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading the Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the number of test cases `T` and iterates through each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `last_year` to the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.

3. **Calculating the Year for Each Subsequent Sign:**
   - For each subsequent sign `i` (from 1 to n-1), it calculates the next year using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1}{a[i]}\right) \times a[i]
     \]
     This formula ensures that the next sign occurs on the next multiple of `a[i]` after `last_year`.
   - It then updates `last_year` to `next_year`.

4. **Storing the Results:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the final `last_year` to the results list.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one, and it calculates the correct year for the n-th sign to occur.
