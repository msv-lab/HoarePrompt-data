Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, based on the given periodicities and the sequential requirement of the signs. It reads the input, processes each test case, calculates the year for each sign to occur sequentially, and outputs the correct year for the n-th sign. The logic used to find the next occurrence of each sign after the previous one is accurate and follows the problem description.
