Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to validate the original assessment.

### Problem Recap
The problem involves determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that each sign occurs at regular intervals and must occur sequentially. For each test case, we need to calculate the year when the n-th sign will occur based on the periodicities of the signs.

### Program Analysis
The program reads the input, processes each test case, and calculates the year for the n-th sign using the provided formula. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the first integer to determine the number of test cases, `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs, `n`, and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes `last_year` to the first periodicity `a[0]`. This is because the first sign will occur at the first multiple of `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year the sign can occur using the formula:
     ```
     next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
     ```
     This formula ensures that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`. Here's a breakdown of the formula:
     - `last_year + 1` ensures that we are looking for the next occurrence after `last_year`.
     - `a[i] - 1` is added to ensure that we round up to the next multiple of `a[i]`.
     - The entire expression `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` effectively calculates the ceiling of `(last_year + 1) / a[i]` and multiplies it by `a[i]` to get the next multiple.

3. **Updating the Last Year:**
   - After calculating `next_year`, it updates `last_year` to `next_year` and continues to the next sign.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the final `last_year` to the results list.
   - Finally, it prints all results for each test case.

### Annotations
The annotations confirm the state of the program at key points:
- The `data` list contains all input values split by whitespace.
- `T` is the number of test cases.
- `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year` for each test case.
- The formula used to calculate `next_year` is correctly annotated as ensuring the smallest multiple of `a[i]` greater than `last_year`.

### Validation
The original assessment correctly identifies that the program uses the appropriate formula to ensure each subsequent sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The annotations support this reasoning by detailing the state of the program and the calculations performed.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur by ensuring each subsequent sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The formula used is correct, and the program handles multiple test cases appropriately.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
