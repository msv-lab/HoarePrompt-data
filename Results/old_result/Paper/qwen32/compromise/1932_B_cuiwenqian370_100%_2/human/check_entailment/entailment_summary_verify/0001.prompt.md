You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        last_year = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
            last_year = next_year
        results.append(str(last_year))
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of signs and their respective periodicities. It calculates the synchronized blinking periodicity for all signs in each test case and outputs the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that each sign occurs at regular intervals and must occur sequentially. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and whether it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads input from standard input in a single read operation and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the first integer to determine the number of test cases, `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs, `n`, and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes `last_year` to the first periodicity `a[0]`. This is because the first sign will occur at the first multiple of `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year the sign can occur using the formula: 
     ```
     next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
     ```
     This formula ensures that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`. Here's a breakdown of the formula:
     - `last_year + 1` ensures that we are looking for the next occurrence after `last_year`.
     - `a[i] - 1` is added to ensure that we round up to the next multiple of `a[i]`.
     - The entire expression `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` effectively calculates the ceiling of `(last_year + 1) / a[i]` and multiplies it by `a[i]` to get the next multiple.

3. **Updating the Last Year:**
   - After calculating `next_year`, it updates `last_year` to `next_year` and continues to the next sign.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the final `last_year` to the results list.
   - Finally, it prints all results for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur by ensuring each subsequent sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The formula used to calculate the next occurrence of each sign is correct, and the program handles multiple test cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description.

### Your Response:
Reasoning: The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur by ensuring each subsequent sign occurs strictly after the previous one using the appropriate formula. It handles multiple test cases as required.
Correctness: **True**
