Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The logic in the program is flawed because it simply counts the number of elements in the sorted array that are equal to the median element, which does not necessarily correspond to the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to increase the median value by at least 1, which means we need to ensure that the middle element (or the larger of the two middle elements if `n` is even) in the sorted array is increased by 1. The optimal strategy is to increment the smallest elements that are equal to the current median until the median itself increases.

For example, in the case where `n` is odd, the median is the middle element. If there are multiple middle elements that are equal to the current median, we need to increment enough of them to make the middle element larger than the current median. Similarly, for even `n`, we need to ensure that the larger of the two middle elements is increased.

The provided program does not implement this logic. Instead, it simply counts how many elements are equal to the median, which is not the correct approach to solving the problem.

Correctness: **False**
