Postcondition: **`n` is the integer input by the user, and its current value is 1, satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order where each integer `a_i` is provided by the user input and satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.**
