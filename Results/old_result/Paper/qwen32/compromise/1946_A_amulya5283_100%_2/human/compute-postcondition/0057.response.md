The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `mdx`, and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `mdx`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `mdx + 1`. The values of `n` and `mdx` remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 1`**
