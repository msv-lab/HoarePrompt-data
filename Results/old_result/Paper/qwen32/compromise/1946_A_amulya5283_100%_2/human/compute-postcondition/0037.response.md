The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. 

Given the initial state, `res` is either 0 or 1. After the execution of `res += 1`, `res` will be either 1 or 2, respectively.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `mdx`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the length of the list `a` and must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`; `res` is either 1 or 2; `i` is `i + 1`**.
