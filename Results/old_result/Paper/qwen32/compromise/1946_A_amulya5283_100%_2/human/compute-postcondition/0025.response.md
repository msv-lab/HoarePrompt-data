Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is an integer input by the user, satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. If `n` is 1, the program does not modify `t`, `n`, or `a`. Otherwise, `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, and `res` is the count of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.**

In natural language: The value of `t` has been decreased by 1. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged. If `n` is greater than 1, `mdx` and `res` are still calculated as described, but their values are not modified by this code snippet.
