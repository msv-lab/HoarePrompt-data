The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. Specifically, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 again, provided that `i` is still less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4
- `n` is an integer input by the user, satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, and `n` is not equal to 1
- `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order where each integer `a_i` is provided by the user input and satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9
- `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`
- `i` is `i + 1` (from the previous iteration)

To adjust the state for the start of the next iteration:
- Increment `i` by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer input by the user, satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, and `n` is not equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order where each integer `a_i` is provided by the user input and satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`; `i` is incremented by 1**
