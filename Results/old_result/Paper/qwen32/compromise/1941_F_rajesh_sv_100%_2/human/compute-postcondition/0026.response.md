The code snippet provided sets `next_max_diff` to the current value of `max_diff`. No other variables are modified by this line of code. Therefore, the state of `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `diff`, `max_diff`, and `index` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `m` and `k` are -inf, `A`, `D`, `F` are lists or variables as initially defined, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `A[3] - A[2]` and `index` is set to 3. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains -inf and `index` remains None. If `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[3] - A[2]`. Otherwise, `next_max_diff` remains unchanged. `next_max_diff` is equal to `max_diff`.**
