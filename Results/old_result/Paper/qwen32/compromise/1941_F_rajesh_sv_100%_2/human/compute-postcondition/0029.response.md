The code snippet provided updates the value of `next_max_diff` to be equal to `diff`. Since `diff` is already defined as `A[3] - A[2]`, the value of `next_max_diff` will now also be `A[3] - A[2]`.

The other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `index`) remain unchanged in their previous states.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `m` and `k` are -inf, `A`, `D`, `F` are lists or variables as initially defined, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`, `max_diff` is -inf, `index` is None, `next_max_diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`.**
