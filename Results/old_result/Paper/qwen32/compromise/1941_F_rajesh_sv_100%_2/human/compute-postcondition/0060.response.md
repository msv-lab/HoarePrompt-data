Output State: **`n` is the length of list `A`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `A` and `D` remain unchanged, `F` is a list that must have at least one element, `max_diff` holds the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` holds the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` holds the index of the element in `A` where `max_diff` occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, and `right` is `A[index]`; `ans` is equal to `min(ans, max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f))`; `l` equals `h`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the maximum of two expressions: `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. All other variables remain unchanged.
