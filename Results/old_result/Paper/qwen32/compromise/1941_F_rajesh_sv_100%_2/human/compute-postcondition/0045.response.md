Postcondition: **`n` is the length of list `A`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `A` and `D` remain unchanged, `F` is a list that must have at least one element, `max_diff` holds the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` holds the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` holds the index of the element in `A` where `max_diff` occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, and `right` is `A[index]`; `ans` is equal to `max_diff`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is set to `mid + 1` and `h` is set to `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`. Otherwise, `h` is set to `mid`. In both cases, `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**
