Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the input, creates a list of integers from 1 to `n`, reverses the elements at even indices, and prints the modified list. This process is repeated for multiple test cases, with the constraint that the sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
