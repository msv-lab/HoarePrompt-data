Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5. The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

```
a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
```

The code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to `n`. Then it creates a list `a` that contains integers from 1 to `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is the integer input; `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`.**

In this output state, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is the integer value provided by the input, and `a` is a list containing integers starting from 1 up to `n`.
