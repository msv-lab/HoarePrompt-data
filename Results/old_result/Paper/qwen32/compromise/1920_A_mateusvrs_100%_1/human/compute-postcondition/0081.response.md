To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variables `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` evolve with each iteration. The loop processes a series of inputs, each consisting of two integers `a` and `x`. The behavior of the loop is as follows:

- If `a` is 1, `bx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `x`.
- If `a` is 2, `ax` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `x`.
- If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `x` is added to the set `cx`.

Let's summarize the final state after `n` iterations:

- `bx` will hold the maximum value of all `x` values encountered where `a` was 1.
- `ax` will hold the minimum value of all `x` values encountered where `a` was 2.
- `cx` will contain all unique `x` values encountered where `a` was neither 1 nor 2.
- `t` remains at least 1 and `n` remains the number of iterations, but these do not change during the loop.
- The variables `a` and `x` will hold the values of the last input processed, but they are not part of the final output state as they are loop variables and do not persist after the loop ends.

Given the initial values:
- `bx` starts at -1.
- `ax` starts at 1000000007.
- `cx` starts as an empty set.

After processing all `n` inputs, the final state will be:

Output State: **`bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` was 2, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2, `t` is at least 1, and `n` is the number of iterations.**

In simpler terms, `bx` will be the largest number seen with `a` as 1, `ax` will be the smallest number seen with `a` as 2, and `cx` will be a collection of all unique numbers seen with `a` as anything other than 1 or 2.
