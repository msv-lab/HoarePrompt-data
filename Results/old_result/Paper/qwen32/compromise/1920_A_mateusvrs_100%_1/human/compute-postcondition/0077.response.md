Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `a` is the first integer from the input.
- `x` is the second integer from the input.
- `bx` is `max(x, -1)` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1.
- `ax` is `min(x, 1000000007)` if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007.
- `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `x`.
- `t` is at least 1.
- `n` is at least 1.

Code:
```python
ax = min(x, ax)
```

The code updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of the current value of `ax` and `x`.

Let's break down the possible scenarios based on the value of `a`:

1. If `a` is 2:
   - Initially, `ax` is `min(x, 1000000007)`.
   - After the code, `ax` will be `min(x, min(x, 1000000007))`, which simplifies to `min(x, 1000000007)`.

2. If `a` is not 2:
   - Initially, `ax` is 1000000007.
   - After the code, `ax` will be `min(x, 1000000007)`.
   - If `x` is greater than 1000000007, `ax` remains 1000000007.
   - If `x` is less than or equal to 1000000007, `ax` becomes `x`.

The other variables (`a`, `x`, `bx`, `cx`, `t`, `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `bx` is `max(x, -1)` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `ax` is `min(x, 1000000007)` if `a` is 2 or `x` if `a` is not 2 and `x` is less than or equal to 1000000007, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `x`, `t` is at least 1, `n` is at least 1.**
