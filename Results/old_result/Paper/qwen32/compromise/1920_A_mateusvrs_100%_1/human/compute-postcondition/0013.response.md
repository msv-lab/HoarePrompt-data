The code snippet `ax = min(x, ax)` updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and the current value of `ax`. Given that `ax` is initially set to `1000000007`, the new value of `ax` will be `x` if `x` is less than `1000000007`; otherwise, it will remain `1000000007`.

Since the initial value of `ax` is `1000000007`, the new value of `ax` will be `x` if `x < 1000000007`. If `x` is `1000000007` or greater, `ax` will remain `1000000007`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `cx` is an empty set; `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `1000000007`; `bx` is -1; `a` is 2; `x` is the second integer from the input.**
