The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `cx`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the iterable `cx` and the variable `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, `cx` is an iterable with at least one element, `i` is the next element in `cx`, `bx` is unchanged, `ax` is unchanged, and if `i` is between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), `tmp` is incremented by 1.

To execute the loop one more time, `cx` must still have at least one element left to iterate over. The variable `i` will be assigned the next element from `cx`.

State: **`cx` is an iterable with at least one element, `i` is the next element in `cx`, `bx` is unchanged, `ax` is unchanged**.
