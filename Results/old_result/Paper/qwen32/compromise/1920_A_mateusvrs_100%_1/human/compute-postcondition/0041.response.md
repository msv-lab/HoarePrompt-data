The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the iterable `cx`. Since `cx` is an iterable with at least one element, we need to adjust `i` to the next element in `cx` for the loop to execute one more time. The states of `cx`, `bx`, `ax`, and `tmp` should remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Let's denote the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_current`. For the next iteration, `i` should be set to the next element in the iterable `cx`.

State: **`cx` is an iterable with at least one element, `i` is the next element in `cx`, `bx` is unchanged, `ax` is unchanged, `tmp` is unchanged**.
