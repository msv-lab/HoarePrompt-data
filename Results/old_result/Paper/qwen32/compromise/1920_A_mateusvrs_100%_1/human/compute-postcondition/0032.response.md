To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variables `cx`, `ax`, and `bx` are updated based on the input values `a` and `x` over all `n` iterations.

Here's a breakdown of how the variables change during each iteration:
- If `a == 1`, `bx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `x`.
- If `a == 2`, `ax` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `x`.
- If `a == 3`, `x` is added to the set `cx`.

After all `n` iterations, the final state will be:
- `t`: remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop.
- `n`: remains unchanged as it is the loop control variable.
- `cx`: will contain all unique values of `x` that were provided when `a == 3`.
- `ax`: will be the minimum value of `x` that was provided when `a == 2`.
- `bx`: will be the maximum value of `x` that was provided when `a == 1`.

**Output State:** **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is an integer representing the number of iterations; `cx` is a set containing all unique values of `x` where `a == 3`; `ax` is the minimum value of `x` where `a == 2`, or 1000000007 if no such `x` was provided; `bx` is the maximum value of `x` where `a == 1`, or -1 if no such `x` was provided.**

In simpler terms:
- `t` and `n` remain the same as they were initially.
- `cx` will have all unique `x` values that were input when `a` was 3.
- `ax` will be the smallest `x` value that was input when `a` was 2, or it will stay as 1000000007 if no such `x` was provided.
- `bx` will be the largest `x` value that was input when `a` was 1, or it will stay as -1 if no such `x` was provided.
