Postcondition: **`bx` is the maximum `x` encountered when `a == 1`, `ax` is the minimum `x` encountered when `a == 2`, `cx` is a set of all `x` encountered when `a == 3` that must have at least one element, `t` is `t - n`, `n` is 0, `r` remains unchanged, and `tmp` is incremented by 1 if `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`. `i` is `i_new`, where `i_new` is another element from `cx`.**
