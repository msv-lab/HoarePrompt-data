The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`. The initial values of `bx`, `ax`, `t`, `n`, and `cx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`bx` is -1, `ax` is 1000000007, `t` is at least 1, `n` is at least 1, `cx` is an empty set, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input.**
