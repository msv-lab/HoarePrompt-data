The code snippet creates a new set named `cx`. The variables `t` and `n` are not modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state remains with `t` being an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500 and `n` being an input integer, and `cx` being an empty set.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is an input integer; `cx` is an empty set.**
