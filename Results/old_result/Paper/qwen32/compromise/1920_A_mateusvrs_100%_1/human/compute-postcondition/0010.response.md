The code updates the value of `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and the current value of `bx`. Given that `bx` is initially -1, `bx` will be updated to the value of `x` if `x` is greater than -1. Since `x` is the second integer from the input, the exact value of `x` is not specified, but `bx` will be the larger of `x` and -1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `cx` is an empty set; `ax` is 1000000007; `bx` is max(x, -1); `a` is 1; `x` is the second integer from the input.**
