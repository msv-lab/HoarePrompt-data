The code snippet `cx = set()` initializes `cx` as an empty set. This affects the variable `cx` directly by changing its value to an empty set. The other variables (`bx`, `ax`, `r`, `tmp`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`bx` and `ax` are integers. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, `r` has an additional element `0` appended to it. Otherwise, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), and `r` has a new element appended, which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. `t` is at least 1; `n` is an input integer; `cx` is an empty set.**
