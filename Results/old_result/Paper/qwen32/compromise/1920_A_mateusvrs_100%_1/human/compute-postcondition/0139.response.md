The code snippet `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. The other variables (`bx`, `ax`, `cx`, `t`, `n`, `r`, and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`bx` is the maximum `x` encountered when `a == 1`, `ax` is the minimum `x` encountered when `a == 2`, `cx` is a set of all `x` encountered when `a == 3` that must have at least one element, `t` is `t - n`, `n` is 0, `r` remains unchanged, `tmp` is 1 if the first element in `cx` satisfies `i >= bx` and `i <= ax`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0, and `i` is another element from `cx` if it exists; `tmp` is incremented by 1.**
