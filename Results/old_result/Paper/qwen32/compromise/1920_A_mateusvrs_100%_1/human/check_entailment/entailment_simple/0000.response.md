### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated states.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It initializes an empty list `r` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case:
     - It reads the number of constraints `n`.
     - It initializes:
       - `cx` as an empty set to store the values that `k` cannot be (type 3 constraints).
       - `ax` to a large value (1000000007) to find the minimum upper bound (type 2 constraints).
       - `bx` to -1 to find the maximum lower bound (type 1 constraints).
     - For each constraint:
       - If the constraint is of type 1 (`a == 1`), it updates `bx` to the maximum of `bx` and `x`.
       - If the constraint is of type 2 (`a == 2`), it updates `ax` to the minimum of `ax` and `x`.
       - If the constraint is of type 3 (`a == 3`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.
     - After processing all constraints, it checks if the maximum lower bound (`bx`) is greater than the minimum upper bound (`ax`). If so, it means there is no valid `k` that satisfies all constraints, and it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
     - Otherwise, it counts how many values in the set `cx` lie within the range `[bx, ax]` (inclusive). It subtracts this count from the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` (which is `ax - bx + 1`) to get the number of valid `k` values and appends this count to the result list `r`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results stored in the list `r`, each on a new line.

### Verification:

- The program correctly identifies the maximum lower bound (`bx`) and the minimum upper bound (`ax`) from the constraints.
- It correctly handles the type 3 constraints by storing them in a set `cx` and counting how many of these values lie within the valid range `[bx, ax]`.
- The logic for calculating the number of valid `k` values is correct: it subtracts the count of invalid values (those in `cx` and within the range) from the total number of integers in the range.
- The program handles multiple test cases correctly and outputs the results as required.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to be correctly implementing the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
