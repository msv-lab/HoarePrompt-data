Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - It initializes a list `r` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes `cx` as a set to store the values of `x` for constraints of type 3.
   - It initializes `ax` to a large number (`1000000000 + 7`) and `bx` to `-1`. These will be used to store the minimum and maximum bounds for `k` respectively.

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, it reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - If `a` is 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `bx` and `x`.
   - If `a` is 2 (k must be less than or equal to x), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `ax` and `x`.
   - If `a` is 3 (k must be not equal to x), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` (the lower bound) is greater than `ax` (the upper bound). If so, it means there are no valid values for `k`, and it appends `0` to the results list `r`.
   - If `bx` is not greater than `ax`, it calculates the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints:
     - It initializes `tmp` to `0` to count how many values in `cx` fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
     - It iterates over each value `i` in `cx` and increments `tmp` if `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`.
     - It appends the result `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` to the results list `r`.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints all the results in `r`, each on a new line.

### Correctness:

- The program correctly processes each type of constraint.
- It correctly updates the bounds `bx` and `ax` based on constraints of type 1 and 2.
- It correctly counts the number of values in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts this count from the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]`.
- The logic to handle the constraints and compute the number of valid `k` values is correct.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem based on the given constraints and examples.

**Correctness: True**
