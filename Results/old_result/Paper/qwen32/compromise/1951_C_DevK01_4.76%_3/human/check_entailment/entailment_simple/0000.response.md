Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the list of ticket prices and then greedily purchasing tickets from the cheapest available days. However, there are several issues with the logic implemented:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**: The program incorrectly calculates the cost of purchasing tickets. The formula used to compute the cost does not correctly account for the increasing prices due to previous purchases. Specifically, the additional cost due to the price increase should be calculated for each purchase, not just once at the end.

2. **Handling of Remaining Tickets**: The logic for handling the remaining tickets after purchasing `m` tickets per day is flawed. The program does not correctly account for the fact that the number of tickets left to purchase (`k`) should be reduced by the number of tickets purchased each day, and the prices should be updated accordingly.

3. **Simplification Assumptions**: The program makes incorrect assumptions about the number of tickets that can be bought each day and the resulting price increases. The logic does not correctly simulate the process of purchasing tickets over multiple days with increasing prices.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when the number of tickets to be purchased is less than the maximum allowed per day (`m`).

Given these issues, the program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to purchase the required number of tickets.

Correctness: **False**
