Given the code snippet and the initial state, let's determine the output state.

The code snippet is:
```python
r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

The new variable `r` is calculated using the formula `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. Since `k` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can express `r` in terms of `a[i]`, `k`, and `i`.

After the execution of the code snippet, the output state will include the new variable `r` and the updated value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is incremented by 1; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`**.

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100, `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` remains a sorted list of integers, `i` has been incremented by 1, and a new variable `r` is calculated as `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`.
