The given code snippet modifies the value of `k` by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from it. All other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `r` is the first element of `a`.
- `rem` is `0`.
- `y` is `0`.
- `ii` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `ii` at the end of the previous iteration.
- `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is less than or equal to `k`.

After executing the line `k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, the value of `k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. The other variables retain their initial values.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers; `n` is an input integer greater than 0; `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`; `r` is the first element of `a`; `rem` is `0`; `y` is `0`; `ii` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `ii` at the end of the previous iteration.**
