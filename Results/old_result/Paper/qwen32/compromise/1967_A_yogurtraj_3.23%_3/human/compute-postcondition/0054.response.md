Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `k` is an input integer; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`; `y` is `0`; `ii` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `ii` at the end of the previous iteration; `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`.**

Explanation: The value of `rem` is updated to `k % (i + 1)`. All other variables retain their previous values.
