The code snippet provided sets the value of `r` to `a[i + 1]`. This means that the previous value of `r` is overwritten. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the value of `r` was conditionally set to either `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` or `a[i + 1]`. Since the code explicitly sets `r` to `a[i + 1]`, the conditional logic regarding the previous value of `r` is disregarded.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers; `n` is an input integer greater than 0; `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`; `r` is `a[i + 1]`; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` if the if part was executed, otherwise it remains `0`; `y` is `n - 1 - i` if the if part was executed, otherwise it is `0`; `ii` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `ii` at the end of the previous iteration; `i` is `i + 2`.**
