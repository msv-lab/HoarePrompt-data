The code snippet `r = a[i + 1]` updates the value of `r` to be the element at index `i + 1` in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `r` was initially the first element of `a`. After executing the code, `r` is now the element at index `i + 1`.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers; `n` is an input integer greater than 0; `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`; `r` is the element at index `i + 1` of `a`; `rem` is `0`; `y` is `0`; `ii` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `ii` at the end of the previous iteration.**
