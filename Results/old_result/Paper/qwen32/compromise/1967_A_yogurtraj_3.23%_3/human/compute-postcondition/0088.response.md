The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The variable `ii` was previously incremented by 1, and this state remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the new values of `n` and `k` as integers derived from the input, while `ii` retains its incremented value.

Output State: **`ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.**
