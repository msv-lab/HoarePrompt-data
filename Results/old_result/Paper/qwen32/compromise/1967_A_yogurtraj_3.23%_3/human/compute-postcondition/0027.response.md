Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is incremented by 1. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `r` is set to `a[i]`, `rem` is set to `0`, `y` is set to `n - 1 - i`, and `k` is set to `0`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` and `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`.**
