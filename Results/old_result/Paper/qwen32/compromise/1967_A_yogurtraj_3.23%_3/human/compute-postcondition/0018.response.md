To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which is just `i` in this case. The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `n - 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- Depending on the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, either the loop breaks or continues with updated values of `k`, `r`, `rem`, and `y`.

Let's analyze the loop head:
- The loop variable `i` ranges from `0` to `n - 2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` had a specific value. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, as long as it remains within the bounds of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `i` incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is incremented by 1**.

If `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`, provided `x + 1 < n - 1`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can express the state generally as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is incremented by 1**.

However, to be more precise, if we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`, then at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is `i_prev + 1`**.

Since we don't have `i_prev`, we can simply say:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is incremented by 1**.

But for clarity and precision, let's assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is `x + 1`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `x`, the most general form is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is incremented by 1**.

Thus, the final answer is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is incremented by 1**.
