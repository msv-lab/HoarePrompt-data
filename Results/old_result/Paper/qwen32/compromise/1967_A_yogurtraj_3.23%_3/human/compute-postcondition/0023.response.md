The given code snippet sets `k` to 0. This affects the value of `k` directly, and since `r` and `rem` depend on the value of `k`, their values will also be affected based on the new value of `k`. However, the code does not specify new values for `r` and `rem` after changing `k`, so we assume they retain their expressions but with the updated `k`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `k` is set to 0.
- `r` is recalculated as `a[i] + 0 // (i + 1)`, which simplifies to `a[i]`.
- `rem` is recalculated as `0 % (i + 1)`, which simplifies to `0`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `y`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is incremented by 1; `r` is `a[i]`; `rem` is `0`; `y` is `n - 1 - i`; `k` is `0`.**
