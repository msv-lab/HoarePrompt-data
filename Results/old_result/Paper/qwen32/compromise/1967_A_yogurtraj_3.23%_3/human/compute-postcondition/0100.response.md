Output State: **`ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`; `y` is `n - 1 - i`; `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `ii`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, `rem`, `y`, and the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
