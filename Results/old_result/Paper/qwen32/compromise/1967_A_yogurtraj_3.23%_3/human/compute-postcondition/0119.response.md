Output State: **`ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` is greater than 0; `a` remains a sorted list of integers; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `r` is assigned the value `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`; `rem` is assigned the value `k % (i + 1)`; `y` is assigned the value `n - 1 - i`; `k` is 0; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `ii`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `r`, `rem`, `y`, and `k` remain as described in the initial state. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
