The code assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to the variable `r`. This means `r` now holds the value of the element in the list `a` at the index `i + 1`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `k`) remain unchanged by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is incremented by 1; `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`; `r` is `a[i + 1]`.**
