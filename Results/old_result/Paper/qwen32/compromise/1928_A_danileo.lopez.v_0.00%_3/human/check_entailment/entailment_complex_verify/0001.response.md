### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program code in detail.

#### Problem Analysis:
Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\). He wants to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then form another rectangle using these two smaller rectangles. The key points are:
1. The cut must be parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle.
2. The resulting rectangles can be rotated and moved as needed.
3. Two rectangles that differ only by a 90Â° rotation are considered the same.

#### Key Observations:
- If either dimension \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two equal parts along that dimension. These two parts can then be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.
- If both dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, any cut will result in two rectangles of different sizes that cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even:
- If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, it prints "Yes".
- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it prints "No".

#### Annotations:
The annotations confirm that the program processes each test case by checking the evenness of the dimensions and outputs "Yes" or "No" accordingly.

#### Validation:
- **Case 1: \(a\) is even or \(b\) is even**
  - Example: \(2 \times 6\)
  - The program will print "Yes" because \(a\) is even.
  - This is correct because Bob can cut the rectangle into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles and form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle.

- **Case 2: Both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd**
  - Example: \(2 \times 1\)
  - The program will print "No" because both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd.
  - This is correct because any cut will result in two rectangles that cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can form another rectangle based on the evenness of the dimensions. The annotations and reasoning support this conclusion.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
