The function `func` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of Bob's rectangle. For each test case, it processes these dimensions. The function handles up to `t` such test cases, where `t` is the number of test cases provided. The functionality of the function is to accept pairs of integers `a` and `b` for each test case and determine some output based on these dimensions. However, the specific output based on the dimensions is not provided in the given constraints and relationships. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b` for each test case, representing the dimensions of Bob's rectangle, and processes up to `t` such test cases.**
