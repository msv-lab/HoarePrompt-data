Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \); `n` is an integer such that \( 3 \leq n \leq 500 \); `ans` is a list of `n` integers where the first \( n-2 \) elements are `10`, the \( n-3 \) element is `10 - arr[n-2] - arr[n-4]`, the \( n-2 \) element is `10 - arr[n-2]`, and the last element is `10`; `i` is `n - 5`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `i` has been decremented by 1, so it is now `n - 5`. All other variables remain unchanged.
