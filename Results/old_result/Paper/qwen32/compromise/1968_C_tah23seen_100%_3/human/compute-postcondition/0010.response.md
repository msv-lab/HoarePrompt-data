The value of `i` is decremented by 1. Given that the initial value of `i` is \( n - 4 \), after the decrement, `i` will be \( n - 5 \).

The other variables (`arr`, `n`, `ans`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \); `n` is an integer such that \( 3 \leq n \leq 500 \); `ans` is a list of `n` integers where the first \( n-2 \) elements are `10`, the \( n-3 \) element is `10 - arr[n-2] - arr[n-4]`, the \( n-2 \) element is `10 - arr[n-2]`, the \( n-4 \) element is `10 - arr[n-2] - 2 * arr[n-4]`, and the last element is `10`; `i` is \( n - 5 \)**.
