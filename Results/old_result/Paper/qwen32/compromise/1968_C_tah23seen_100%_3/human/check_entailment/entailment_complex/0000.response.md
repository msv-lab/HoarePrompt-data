### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution to see if it meets the requirements.

**Problem Requirements:**
1. We need to find an array `a` of length `n` such that `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for all `1 <= i <= n`.
2. For each `2 <= i <= n`, `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}`.

**Given Solution:**
The provided program has a function `func_1` which is supposed to generate the array `a` based on the given `x` array. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly fulfill the problem's requirements. 

Here's a breakdown of the implementation:
- The function initializes `ans` as an array of size `n` with all elements set to `10^9`.
- It then iterates from `i = n-2` to `0` and sets `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`.

This approach does not guarantee that the generated array `ans` will satisfy `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`. The given implementation seems to be attempting a different logic which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

**Correct Approach:**
A correct approach would be to set `a_1` to a sufficiently large value (e.g., `10^9`) and then set `a_i = x_i + a_{i-1}` for `2 <= i <= n`. This ensures that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` because `a_i` is constructed to be larger than `a_{i-1}` and the remainder when `a_i` is divided by `a_{i-1}` will be `x_i`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because the logic inside `func_1` does not correctly generate the required array `a`.

**Correctness: False**
