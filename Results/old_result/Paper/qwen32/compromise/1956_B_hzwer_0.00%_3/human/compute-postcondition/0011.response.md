The given code snippet updates the value of `dp[i][j]` based on the maximum value between `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. Since the specific values of `i` and `j` are not provided, we will express the updated state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input and contains the integer `j + 1` exactly once, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with all elements initialized to `0` except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is `0`, and `j` is `n-1`. The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)`.**
