The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i][j]` based on the maximum of three possible values. The variables `n`, `cards`, `dp`, and `j` are part of the initial state, and `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state but is assumed to be defined in the context where this line of code is executed.

Given:
- `n` is at least 3.
- `cards` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`.
- `j` is `n-3`.

The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to be the maximum of:
- `dp[i + 1][j]`
- `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`
- `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`

Output State: **`n` is at least 3; `cards` is a list of integers read from the input; `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where `dp[i][j]` has been updated to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])`; `j` is `n-3`.**

In simple terms, the value at `dp[i][j]` is now the largest of the three specified values, and all other variables remain unchanged.
