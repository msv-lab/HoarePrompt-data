The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list called `cards`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it was initially set to represent the number of cards each player receives in the current test case. The number of test cases `t` and the subsequent lines of input for each test case remain unchanged as well.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value read from the input, representing the number of cards each player receives in the current test case; `cards` is a list of integers read from the input.**
