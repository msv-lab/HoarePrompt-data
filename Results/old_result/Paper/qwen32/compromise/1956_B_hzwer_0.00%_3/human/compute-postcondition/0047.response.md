The code snippet `dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]` updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to be equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1 and `j` is `n - 3`. Therefore, `dp[1][n - 3]` is updated to the value of `dp[2][n - 3]`.

Other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The `dp` table is still fully updated after all iterations, and the values of `n` and `cards` remain the same.

Output State: **The `dp` table is fully updated after all iterations, with `dp[i][j]` values reflecting the maximum number of cards that can be collected based on the occurrences of each card in `cards`. If `cards.count(j + 1)` is 0, `dp[1][n - 1]` is equal to `dp[2][n - 1]` and `dp[1][n - 2]` is equal to `dp[2][n - 2]`. If `cards.count(j + 1)` is 1, `dp[1][n - 1]` is `max(dp[2][n - 1], dp[3][n - 2] + 1)` and `dp[1][n - 2]` is `max(dp[2][n - 2], dp[3][n - 3] + 1)`. Otherwise, `dp[1][n - 1]` is the maximum of `dp[2][n - 1]`, `dp[3][n - 2] + 1`, and `dp[2][n]`, and `dp[1][n - 2]` is `max(dp[2][n - 2], dp[3][n - 3] + 1, dp[2][n - 1])`. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. `i` is 1, `j` is `n - 3`, and `n` must be greater than 0. `dp[1][n - 3]` is equal to `dp[2][n - 3]`.**
