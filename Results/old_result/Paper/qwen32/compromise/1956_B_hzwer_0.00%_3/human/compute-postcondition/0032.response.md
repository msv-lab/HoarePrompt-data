The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i][j]` by assigning it the value of `dp[i + 1][j]`. Given the initial state, where `i` is 1 and `j` is `n - 1`, this means `dp[1][n - 1]` is set to `dp[2][n - 1]`.

The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged. The `dp` table is still fully updated after all iterations, but the specific value at `dp[1][n - 1]` has been updated. The condition `cards.count(j + 1)` is 0, which remains unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` table is fully updated after all iterations, with `dp[i][j]` values reflecting the maximum number of cards that can be collected based on the occurrences of each card in `cards`. The value of `dp[1][n - 1]` is now equal to `dp[2][n - 1]`. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. `i` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `cards.count(j + 1)` is 0.**
