The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range specified in the loop head. The loop will iterate from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive). For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least `1` so that `n - 1` is a valid starting point for `j`.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `j` is set to `n - 1` initially, and `n` must be greater than `0` for the loop to execute.

State: **`dp` table is fully updated after all iterations, with `dp[i][j]` values reflecting the maximum number of cards that can be collected based on the occurrences of each card in `cards`. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with all values updated according to the loop's logic. `i` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0**
