### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem using dynamic programming (DP). However, there are several issues with the implementation that make it incorrect.

1. **Incorrect DP Table Initialization and Usage:**
   - The DP table `dp` is initialized with dimensions `(n+1) x (n+1)`, but the logic inside the nested loops only uses indices up to `n-1` for `i` and `n-1` for `j`. This means the extra row and column are unused.
   - The DP table is supposed to help in calculating the maximum number of points you can get, but the initialization and the transitions inside the DP table do not correctly reflect the problem's requirements.

2. **Incorrect Transition Logic:**
   - The code is trying to use a DP approach to keep track of the maximum points you can get, but the transitions are not correctly defined. The transitions should account for the optimal moves of both players, but the current logic does not consider the optimal strategy of Nene.
   - The code checks the count of cards in the list `cards` for each number `j + 1`. However, this count does not change during the game, and the DP table should reflect the state of the game (i.e., which cards are on the table and which are in the hands of the players).

3. **No Consideration of Nene's Optimal Play:**
   - The code does not account for Nene's optimal strategy to maximize her score and minimize your score. Since Nene plays optimally, the transitions in the DP table should reflect the best possible moves for both players.

4. **Incorrect Output:**
   - The output of the function `func_1` is supposed to be the maximum number of points you can get, but the current implementation does not correctly compute this value due to the issues mentioned above.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues with the DP table initialization, the incorrect transition logic, and the lack of consideration for Nene's optimal play, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem.

### Correctness: **False**
