### Reasoning:
The given Python program is intended to solve the problem of distributing bets on game outcomes such that the total bet is strictly less than the payout for any winning outcome. The program calculates a common multiple of the multipliers and uses it to determine the bets.

Let's break down the logic:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, the number of outcomes and their respective multipliers.
2. **LCM Calculation**: It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers using the `func_2` function, which cumulatively applies the `func_1` function (which calculates the LCM of two numbers).
3. **Bet Distribution**: For each outcome, it assigns a bet equal to the LCM divided by the multiplier for that outcome.
4. **Validation**: It checks if the sum of all bets is less than the LCM. If not, it outputs `-1` indicating no valid distribution is possible. Otherwise, it outputs the calculated bets.

The core idea is to ensure that the sum of bets (`sum(c)`) is strictly less than the LCM (`m`). If this condition is met, the bets satisfy the problem's requirement because for any winning outcome `i`, the payout (`k[i] * c[i]`) will be equal to the LCM, which is greater than the total sum of bets.

However, there is a flaw in the logic. The condition `if sum(c) >= m` is incorrect. The correct condition should be `if sum(c) >= m // min(k)`, because the sum of bets should be strictly less than the minimum possible payout, which is the LCM divided by the largest multiplier (since `m // k[i]` for any `k[i]` will be the bet for that outcome, and the total sum of bets should be less than the smallest possible payout, which is `m // max(k)`).

Given the current implementation, the program will incorrectly output `-1` in cases where a valid distribution of bets is possible. For example, in the third test case of the provided input, the program outputs `-1`, but a valid distribution of bets like `1 1 1 1 1` would satisfy the condition.
