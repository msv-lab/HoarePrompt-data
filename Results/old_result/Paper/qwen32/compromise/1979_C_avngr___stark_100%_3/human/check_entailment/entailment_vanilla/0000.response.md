To determine if the given Python program correctly solves the problem, let's break down the requirements and the provided code.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Distribute the bets (x_i) such that the total bet (sum of all x_i) is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome (k_i * x_i).
2. **Constraints**:
   - For each test case, there are `n` outcomes.
   - Each multiplier `k_i` is between 2 and 20.
   - The total number of outcomes across all test cases does not exceed 200,000.
   - The bet `x_i` for each outcome should be a positive integer (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9).
3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output `n` integers representing the bets, or `-1` if no such distribution is possible.

### Analysis of the Provided Code:
The code consists of two functions:
1. **func_1(a, b)**: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b`. It does this by using the formula `|a * b| // gcd(a, b)`.
2. **func_2(numbers)**: This function calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1` to the list.

### Reasoning:
The purpose of calculating the LCM of the multipliers `k_i` is to find a common value that can be scaled to satisfy the condition for all outcomes. Specifically, if `L` is the LCM of all `k_i`, then setting `x_i = L // k_i` ensures that `k_i * x_i = L` for all `i`. The total bet would be `sum(L // k_i for i in range(n))`, which is strictly less than `L` if `n > 1` and `k_i > 1` for all `i`.

However, the code provided does not directly implement this logic. Instead, it calculates the LCM of the multipliers and does nothing with it. The code does not generate the bets `x_i` and does not check if a solution is possible. Therefore, the code does not solve the problem as described.

### Correctness:
Since the provided code does not generate the required bets or check for the possibility of a solution, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
