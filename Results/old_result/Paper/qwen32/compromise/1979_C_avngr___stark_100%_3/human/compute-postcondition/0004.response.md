Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `result` is the output of `func_1(result, num)`; `num` is the next element in `numbers` after the current `num`.**

Explanation: The `result` variable is updated to be the output of the function `func_1` when called with the current `result` and `num` as arguments. The `num` variable is not changed in this code snippet; it still represents the next element in the `numbers` list after the current `num`. The `numbers` list remains unchanged.
