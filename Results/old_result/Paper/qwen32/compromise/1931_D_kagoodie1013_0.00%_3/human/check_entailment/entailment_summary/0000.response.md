Reasoning:

The provided program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the number of beautiful pairs. Specifically, the program uses two separate modulo maps (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`) to count occurrences of remainders when array elements are divided by `x` and `y`. However, the program incorrectly adds counts from both maps without ensuring that the same index is not counted twice and without properly checking the conditions for a beautiful pair.

The key issue lies in the way `mod_x` is calculated and used:
```python
mod_x = -num % x
```
This calculation is incorrect because it does not match the condition `a_i + a_j is divisible by x`. The correct condition should be checked using the same modulo operation for both elements. The program should check if `(a_i % x + a_j % x) % x == 0` and `(a_i % y - a_j % y) % y == 0`.

Additionally, the current implementation incorrectly assumes that the sum of counts from both maps gives the correct number of beautiful pairs. Instead, it should use a single map to store pairs of remainders `(a_i % x, a_i % y)` and then count pairs that satisfy both conditions.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:
```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        mod_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            key = (mod_x, mod_y)
            count += mod_map.get((x - mod_x % x, y - mod_y % y), 0)
            mod_map[key] = mod_map.get(key, 0) + 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```
However, the above logic still has issues, particularly with handling the subtraction modulo correctly. A more robust approach involves using a nested dictionary or a tuple as a key to track pairs of remainders.

Given the current implementation, the program does not correctly count the number of beautiful pairs based on the provided problem description and example.

Correctness: **False**
