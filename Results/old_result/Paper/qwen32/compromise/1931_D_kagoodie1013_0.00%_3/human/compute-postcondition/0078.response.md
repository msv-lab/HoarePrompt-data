The code snippet provided recalculates the value of `mod_y_key` based on the current value of `num` and `y`. The other variables remain unchanged. Here's the output state:

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one more tuple; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the previous values of `count` if any; `count` is 2; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` mapped to 1; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to 1; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values of the next tuple in `test_cases` where `arr` must have at least one element; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `mod_y_key` is `num % y`; `num` is the next element in `arr`; `mod_x` is `-num % x`; `mod_x_key` is `num % x`.**

In natural language, the value of `mod_y_key` has been updated to `num % y`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
