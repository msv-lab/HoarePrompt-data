The code snippet provided initializes an empty dictionary named `mod_x_map`. This does not affect the values of `test_cases`, `results`, or `count`. Therefore, the output state remains the same for `test_cases`, `results`, and `count`, except for the new variable `mod_x_map` which is introduced and initialized as an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a, such that 1 <= len(test_cases) <= 10^4, 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each a_i in a; `test_cases` must contain at least one valid tuple; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary.**
