The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`, which is iterated over from the list `arr`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` list. If `arr` has at least one element, the loop can execute.

Given the state before the loop starts, `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, and `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`. To ensure the loop executes, `arr` must have at least one element.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one more tuple, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the previous values of `count` if any, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values of the next tuple in `test_cases` where `arr` must have at least one element**.
