The given code snippet updates the `mod_x_map` dictionary by incrementing the count associated with the key `mod_x_key` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Hereâ€™s the updated state:

Output State: **`num` is the next element in `arr`; `x` is unchanged; `mod_x` is `-num % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `count` is increased by the value of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`; `mod_x_key` is `num % x`; `mod_y_key` is `num % y`; `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value associated with `mod_x_key` in the dictionary `mod_x_map` is increased by 1. All other variables retain their previous values.
