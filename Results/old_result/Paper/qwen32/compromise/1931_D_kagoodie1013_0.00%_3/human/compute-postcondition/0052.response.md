To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the given code snippet on the variables. The initial state specifies that `num` is the next element in `arr`. The code snippet then calculates `mod_x` as `-num % x`.

Since the value of `num` is specified as the next element in `arr`, we will keep it as `num` in the output state. The value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, so we will keep it as `x` in the output state. The new variable `mod_x` is calculated based on these inputs.

The expression `-num % x` means that we first negate `num` and then take the modulus with `x`. The result of this operation is stored in `mod_x`.

Therefore, the output state will be:
Output State: **`num` is the next element in `arr`; `x` is unchanged; `mod_x` is `-num % x`.**
