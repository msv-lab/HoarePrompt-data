The code snippet provided calculates `mod_y` as `num % y`. The value of `num` is not provided in the initial state, so we will represent `mod_y` in terms of `num` and `y`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a, such that 1 <= len(test_cases) <= 10^4, 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each a_i in a; `test_cases` must contain at least one valid tuple; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary; `arr` is a list that must contain at least one element; `mod_x` is `-num % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`.**
