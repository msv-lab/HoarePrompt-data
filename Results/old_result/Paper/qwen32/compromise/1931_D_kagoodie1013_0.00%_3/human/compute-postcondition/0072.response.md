The code snippet updates the value of `mod_y_map` by incrementing the count associated with the key `mod_y_key`. If `mod_y_key` does not exist in `mod_y_map`, it is added with a value of 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one more tuple; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the previous values of `count` if any; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` mapped to 1; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to 1; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values of the next tuple in `test_cases` where `arr` must have at least one element; `mod_x` is `-num % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `mod_y_key` is `num % y`.**
