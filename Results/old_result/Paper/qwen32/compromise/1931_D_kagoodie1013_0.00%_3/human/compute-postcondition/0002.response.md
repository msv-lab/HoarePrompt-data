Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a, such that 1 <= len(test_cases) <= 10^4, 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each a_i in a; `test_cases` must contain at least one valid tuple; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0.**

Natural Language: The initial state of `test_cases` remains unchanged as a list of tuples with specified constraints. The `results` list remains empty. The variable `count` is initialized to 0.
