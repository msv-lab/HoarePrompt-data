Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is an empty list, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `gcd_val` is calculated as the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. Given that `x` is 2 and `y` is 1, the GCD of 2 and 1 is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
