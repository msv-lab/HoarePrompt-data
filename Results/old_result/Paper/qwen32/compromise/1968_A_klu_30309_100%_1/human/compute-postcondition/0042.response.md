The code snippet provided updates the value of `max_sum` to be equal to `current_sum`. No other variables are affected by this single line of code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `best_y`, `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, and `current_sum` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum`, `best_y` is updated to `y` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `y` is `y - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.**
