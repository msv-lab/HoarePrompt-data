Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is an empty list, `best_y` is 2, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `gcd_val` is 2, `current_sum` is 4, `max_sum` is 4 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables do not change, but the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
