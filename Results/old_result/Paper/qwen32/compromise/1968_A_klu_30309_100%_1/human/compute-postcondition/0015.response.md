Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is an empty list, `best_y` is 1, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `gcd_val` is 2, `current_sum` is 4, `max_sum` is 4.**

In this output state, the value of `max_sum` has been updated to be equal to `current_sum`, which is 4. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
