To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's break down the steps and the logic of the loop:

1. **Loop Structure**: The loop iterates over `y` from `x - 1` down to `1`. For each `y`, it calculates `gcd_val` as the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, and `current_sum` as `gcd_val + y`.

2. **Condition Check**: If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum`, and `best_y` is updated to `y`. The loop then breaks, stopping further iterations for that particular `x`.

3. **Loop Completion**: The loop continues to the next `x` in `test_cases` and repeats the process.

4. **Results Accumulation**: After processing each `x`, the `best_y` for that `x` is appended to the `results` list.

Given this logic, after all iterations, the state will be:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `test_cases` remains unchanged.
- `results` contains the `best_y` for each `x` processed.
- `max_sum` and `best_y` will have the values determined by the last `x` processed (since `best_y` is reset for each `x`).
- `x` will be the last `x` processed.
- `y` will be the value that gave the maximum `current_sum` for the last `x` processed, or the value where the loop broke.
- `gcd_val` and `current_sum` will hold the values for the last iteration of the loop for the last `x` processed.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` for each `x` processed, `max_sum` is the maximum sum found for the last `x` processed, `best_y` is the value of `y` that gave the maximum sum for the last `x` processed, `x` is the last `x` processed, `y` is the value that gave the maximum `current_sum` for the last `x` processed, or the value where the loop broke, and `gcd_val` and `current_sum` are the values from the last iteration for the last `x` processed.**

In simpler terms, the loop processes each `x` in `test_cases`, finds the `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y`, and stores the result in `results`. The final state reflects the last `x` processed and the corresponding `y` that gave the maximum sum.
