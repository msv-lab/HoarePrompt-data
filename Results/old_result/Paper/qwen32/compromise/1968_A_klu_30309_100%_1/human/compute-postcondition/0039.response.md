The only variable in the loop head is `y`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `y`. The loop iterates from `x - 1` down to `1`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` was some value, and for the loop to execute again, `y` must be decremented by `1` as long as it is greater than `0`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `y` is the current value that was just used in the loop body. For the loop to execute again, `y` should be `y - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `best_y` is updated to `y` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `y` is a predefined integer, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, and `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is not greater than `max_sum`, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged. `y` is decremented by 1 for the next iteration.**

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `best_y` is updated to `y` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `y` is decremented by 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, and `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is not greater than `max_sum`, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.**

To simplify, we focus on the `y` variable:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `best_y` is updated to `y` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `y` is `y - 1`, and `y` must be greater than 0.**

Since `y` is decremented by 1, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `best_y` is updated to `y` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `y` is `y - 1`.**
