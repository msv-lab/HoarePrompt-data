Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` for each `x` processed, `max_sum` is the maximum sum found for the last `x` processed, `best_y` is the value of `y` that gave the maximum sum for the last `x` processed, `x` is the last `x` processed, `y` is the value that gave the maximum `current_sum` for the last `x` processed, or the value where the loop broke, and `gcd_val` and `current_sum` are the values from the last iteration for the last `x` processed. The `results` list now includes the `best_y` value from the last processed `x`.**

In simple terms, the `results` list now has an additional element, which is the `best_y` value from the last processed `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
