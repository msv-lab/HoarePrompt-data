The code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` and assigns the result to `gcd_val`. Given the initial state, `x` is 2 and `y` is 1. The GCD of 2 and 1 is 1. Therefore, `gcd_val` is updated to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is an empty list, `best_y` is 2, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is 4, `max_sum` is 4**.
