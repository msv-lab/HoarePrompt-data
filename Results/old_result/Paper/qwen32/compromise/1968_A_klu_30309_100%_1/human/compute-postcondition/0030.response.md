Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`.**

The value of `best_y` has been updated to 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
