The only variables in the loop head are `y` and the range parameters (`x - 1`, `0`, `-1`). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `y`. If `y` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to be decremented by 1.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time:
- `y` should be 0, but since the loop decrements `y` at the start of each iteration, we need to set `y` to 2 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is an empty list, `best_y` is 1, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `gcd_val` is 1. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum`. Otherwise, `max_sum` remains unchanged.**
