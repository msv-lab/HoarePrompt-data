Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is intended to calculate the area of a square given its four corner coordinates. However, there are issues with the logic used to compute the area.

1. **Sorting the Coordinates:**
   - The program sorts the coordinates, but sorting alone does not guarantee that the sorted coordinates will be in any particular order that would make it easy to calculate the side length of the square.

2. **Calculating the Side Length:**
   - The program calculates the squared distances between two pairs of points (`p1` and `p2`) and then multiplies their square roots to get the area. This approach is incorrect because it assumes that `p1` and `p2` are the sides of the square, which is not necessarily true. The correct approach should involve finding the Euclidean distance between two adjacent points (which will be the side length of the square) and then squaring that distance to get the area.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - One correct approach would be to use a set to find the unique x and y coordinates, then calculate the side length as the difference between the maximum and minimum x or y coordinates (since the sides are parallel to the axes), and finally square this side length to get the area.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        
        # Extract x and y coordinates
        x_coords = [point[0] for point in coord]
        y_coords = [point[1] for point in coord]
        
        # Calculate side length
        side_length = max(x_coords) - min(x_coords)  # or max(y_coords) - min(y_coords)
        
        # Calculate area
        area = side_length ** 2
        
        print(area)
        n -= 1

func()
```

This corrected version extracts the x and y coordinates separately, calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x (or y) coordinates, and then computes the area by squaring the side length.
