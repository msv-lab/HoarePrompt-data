To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to consider the following:

1. **Initial State**: The variable `n` holds the number of test cases (from 1 to 100).
2. **Loop Execution**: For each iteration, the loop reads four coordinates, calculates the area of the square, and prints the result. The loop continues until `n` becomes 0.
3. **Output State after Each Iteration**: 
   - After the first iteration, `n` is decremented by 1, and the loop processes the first set of coordinates.
   - After the second iteration, `n` is further decremented by 1, and the loop processes the second set of coordinates.
   - After the third iteration, `n` is again decremented by 1, and the loop processes the third set of coordinates.
   - This process continues until `n` reaches 0.

### Final Output State:
- **`n`**: After all iterations, `n` will be 0 because the loop decrements `n` by 1 in each iteration until `n` becomes 0.
- **`coord`**: This variable holds the coordinates of the current square being processed. However, after the loop finishes, `coord` will hold the coordinates of the last square processed.
- **`res`**: This variable holds the result of the last calculation, which is the area of the last square processed.
- **`p1` and `p2`**: These variables are intermediate calculations used to determine the area of the square. After the loop finishes, they will hold the values from the last iteration.

### Natural Language Description:
After the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., `n` times), the variable `n` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variable `coord` will contain the coordinates of the last square processed, and `res` will hold the area of that square. The variables `p1` and `p2` will contain the intermediate values used to compute the area of the last square.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `coord` is a sorted list of tuples `((x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4))` based on the last set of input coordinates, `res` is `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))` for the last set of coordinates, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2` for the last set of coordinates, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2` for the last set of coordinates.**
