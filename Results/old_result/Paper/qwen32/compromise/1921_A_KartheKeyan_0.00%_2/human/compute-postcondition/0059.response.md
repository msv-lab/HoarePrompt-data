Output State: **`n` is a non-zero value minus 1, `coord` is `[(x, y), (x, y), (x, y), (x, y)]` sorted by the default tuple comparison, `res` is `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.**

Natural language: The value of `n` has been decreased by 1. All other variables (`coord`, `res`, `p1`, and `p2`) remain unchanged.
