The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The values of `n`, `coord`, `res`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be a non-zero value, `coord` is a list with at least 4 elements, each of which is a list with at least one element, `res` is 0, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer.**
