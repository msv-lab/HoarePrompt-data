Let's break down the given information step by step to determine what will be printed when the `print(res)` statement is executed.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **`n`**: It is specified that `n` must be a non-zero value. However, `n` is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this particular problem.

2. **`coord`**: It is a list of four tuples, each representing a coordinate `(x, y)`. The list is sorted by the default tuple comparison, which means it is sorted first by the x-values, and then by the y-values if the x-values are the same.

3. **`p1`**: It is calculated as `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`. This represents the difference in the x-coordinates of the second and first tuples in the sorted `coord` list.

4. **`p2`**: It is calculated as `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`. This represents the difference in the x-coordinates of the fourth and third tuples in the sorted `coord` list.

5. **`res`**: It is calculated as `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`. This involves taking the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, multiplying them together, and then taking the absolute value of the result.

### Step-by-Step Calculation

1. **Sorting `coord`**: Since `coord` is sorted by the default tuple comparison, the tuples will be ordered primarily by their x-values, and secondarily by their y-values if the x-values are the same.

2. **Calculating `p1`**:
   - `p1` is the difference between the x-values of the second and first tuples in the sorted `coord` list.
   - Let's denote the sorted `coord` list as `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]`.
   - Therefore, `p1 = x2 - x1`.

3. **Calculating `p2`**:
   - `p2` is the difference between the x-values of the fourth and third tuples in the sorted `coord` list.
   - Using the same notation, `p2 = x4 - x3`.

4. **Calculating `res`**:
   - `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.
   - Mathematically, `res = abs(sqrt(p1) * sqrt(p2))`.
   - Using the properties of square roots, this simplifies to `res = abs(sqrt((x2 - x1) * (x4 - x3)))`.

### Final Output

Given the above calculations, the output of `print(res)` will be the absolute value of the square root of the product of the differences in the x-coordinates of the second-first and fourth-third tuples in the sorted `coord` list.

Output: **abs(sqrt((x2 - x1) * (x4 - x3))) (where (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4) are the sorted coordinates in `coord`)**
