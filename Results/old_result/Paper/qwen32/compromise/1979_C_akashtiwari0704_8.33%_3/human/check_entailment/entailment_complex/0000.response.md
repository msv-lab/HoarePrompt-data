### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program and see if it aligns with the problem requirements.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.

2. **Calculating Product:**
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers `prod`. This is used to determine the bets.

3. **Calculating Bets:**
   - For each multiplier `k_i`, the corresponding bet `x_i` is calculated as `prod / k_i`. This ensures that if the i-th outcome wins, the returned amount is `k_i * x_i = prod`, which is more than the total bet `sum(x_i)` since `sum(x_i) < prod`.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the calculated bets `sumo` is less than the product `prod`. If `sumo >= prod`, it prints `-1` indicating that it's not possible to distribute the bets such that the player comes out ahead in every scenario.
   - If `sumo < prod`, it prints the calculated bets.

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the bets for each test case as required.

### Analysis:

- The approach of calculating `prod` and then setting `x_i = prod / k_i` ensures that for each winning outcome `i`, the player receives `k_i * x_i = prod`, which is indeed more than the total bet `sum(x_i)`.
- The check `if sumo >= prod` correctly determines whether the distribution of bets is feasible.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets and checks if they meet the required conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
