The given code snippet updates the variable `sumo` by adding the integer value of `a[i]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the value of `sumo` was 0. After executing `sumo += int(a[i])`, the new value of `sumo` will be `0 + int(a[i])`, which simplifies to `int(a[i])`.

Since `a[i]` is already an integer (as per the context of the problem), `int(a[i])` is just `a[i]`. Therefore, `sumo` will now hold the value of `a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` is a list of `n` integers where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20, `bets` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input with the `i`-th element updated to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of the list `a`, `sumo` is `a[i]`.**
