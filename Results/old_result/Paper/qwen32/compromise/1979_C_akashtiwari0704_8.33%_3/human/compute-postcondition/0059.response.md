Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's analyze what will be printed:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000.
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 50.
- `k` is a list of `n` integers, each between 2 and 20.
- `bets` is an integer between 1 and `n`.
- `a` is a list of integers where the first `bets` elements are updated to `prod // a[i]` and the remaining elements remain unchanged.
- `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`.
- `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` elements of `a`, and it is given that `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.

The provided code snippet contains a single `print` statement:
```python
print(-1)
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `bets`, `a`, `prod`, or `sumo`. It simply outputs the integer `-1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **-1**
