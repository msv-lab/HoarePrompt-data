The code appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the existing string `ans`. The values of `sumo`, `prod`, `bets`, and the condition `bets > i` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is already given as `i + 1`, indicating that `i` has been incremented before this line of code was executed.

Output State: **`sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the value of `a[i-1]` followed by a space, then the value of `a[i]` followed by a space, `bets` must be greater than `i`, `i` is `i + 1`**. 

In simpler terms, `ans` now includes the new element `a[i]` appended to it, and all other conditions and values remain as specified.
