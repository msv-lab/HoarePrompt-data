To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `bets`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `sumo` is less than `prod`.
- `ans` is a string containing the value of `a[i-1]` followed by a space, then the value of `a[i]` followed by a space.
- `bets` must be greater than `i`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(bets):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Since `i` is incremented at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus one. Therefore, if `i` was `i` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

For the loop to continue executing, `i` must still be less than `bets`. Since `bets` must be greater than `i` at the end of the previous iteration, it will still be greater than `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `bets` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (since it's not modified within the loop).

The other variables (`sumo`, `prod`, `ans`, `a`, etc.) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head alone.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the value of `a[i-1]` followed by a space, then the value of `a[i]` followed by a space, `bets` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**
