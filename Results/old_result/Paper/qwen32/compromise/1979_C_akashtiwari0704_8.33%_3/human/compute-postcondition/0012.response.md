The given Python code snippet initializes a variable `sumo` to 0. This does not affect any of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `bets`, `a`, `prod`). Therefore, the only change is the introduction of `sumo` with a value of 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` is a list of `n` integers where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20, `bets` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of the list `a`, `sumo` is 0**.
