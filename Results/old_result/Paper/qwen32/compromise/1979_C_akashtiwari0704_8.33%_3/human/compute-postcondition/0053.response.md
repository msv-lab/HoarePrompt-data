Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` remains a list of `n` integers where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20, `bets` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `bets` ≤ `n`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is now `prod // a[i]` and other elements remain unchanged, `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`, `sumo` is `sumo + int(a[i])`, `i` is `i + 1`**

Explanation: The value of `sumo` is updated to be the sum of its previous value and the integer value of `a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
