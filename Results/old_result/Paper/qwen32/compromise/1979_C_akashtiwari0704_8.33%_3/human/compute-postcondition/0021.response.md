The given code snippet updates the variable `sumo` by adding the integer value of the `i`-th element of the list `a` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50
- `k` is a list of `n` integers where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20
- `bets` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
- `a` is a list of integers with the `i`-th element updated to `prod // a[i]`
- `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of the list `a`
- `sumo` is `a[i] + int(a[i+1])`
- `i` is `i + 1`

After executing the line `sumo += int(a[i])`, the new value of `sumo` will be the old value of `sumo` plus the integer value of `a[i]`.

Therefore, the updated `sumo` will be `a[i] + int(a[i+1]) + int(a[i])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` is a list of `n` integers where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20, `bets` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers with the `i`-th element updated to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of the list `a`, `sumo` is `a[i] + int(a[i+1]) + int(a[i])`, `i` is `i + 1`.**
