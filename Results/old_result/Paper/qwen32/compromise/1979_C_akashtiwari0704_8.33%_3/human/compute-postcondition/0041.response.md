The given code snippet updates the variable `prod` by multiplying it with the `i`-th element of the list `a`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `bets`, and `sumo`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` remains a list of `n` integers where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20, `bets` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `a` is now a list of integers read from the input, `prod` is `prod * a[i]`, `sumo` is the sum of the updated first `bets` elements of `a`.**
