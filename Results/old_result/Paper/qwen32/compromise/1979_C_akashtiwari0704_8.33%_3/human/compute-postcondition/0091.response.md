The given code snippet modifies the value of `sumo` by adding the integer value of `a[i]` to it. No other variables are explicitly modified by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `sumo`. The new value of `sumo` is the old value of `sumo` plus the integer value of `a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` remains a list of `n` integers where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20, `bets` must be at least 1, `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`, `sumo` is `sumo + (prod // a[0]) + int(a[i])`, `T` is `T + 1`, `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`, `i` is 1, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`.**
