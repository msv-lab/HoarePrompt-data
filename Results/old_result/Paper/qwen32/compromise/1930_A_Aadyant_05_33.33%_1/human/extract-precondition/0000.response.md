Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), indicating that there are 2n integers on the whiteboard. The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), which are the numbers written on the whiteboard.**
