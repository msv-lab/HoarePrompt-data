The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `a`, which means `i` should be incremented to the next integer value.

State: **`num` is a string representing a positive integer (1 ≤ int(num) ≤ 5000), `out` is an empty list, `list2` is a list containing the integer values of `list1[2 * j]` for all `j` from 0 to `i`, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from the input string `b`, `a` is an integer equal to the integer value of the original string `num` (1 ≤ a ≤ 5000), `b` is the input string, `i` is `i + 1`**

Since `i` is incremented at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this increment. Therefore, we adjust `i` to be `i + 1` from the previous state.

State: **`num` is a string representing a positive integer (1 ≤ int(num) ≤ 5000), `out` is an empty list, `list2` is a list containing the integer values of `list1[2 * j]` for all `j` from 0 to `i`, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from the input string `b`, `a` is an integer equal to the integer value of the original string `num` (1 ≤ a ≤ 5000), `b` is the input string, `i` is `i + 2`**
