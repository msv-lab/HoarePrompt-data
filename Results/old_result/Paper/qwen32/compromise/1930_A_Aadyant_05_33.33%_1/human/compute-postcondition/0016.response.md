To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior:

The loop runs `a` times, where `a` is the integer value of the string `num`. In each iteration `i` (ranging from 0 to `a-1`), the loop appends the integer value of `list1[2 * i]` to the list `list2`.

Given that the loop runs `a` times, by the end of the loop, `list2` will contain the integer values of `list1[0]`, `list1[2]`, `list1[4]`, ..., `list1[2 * (a-1)]`. 

The other variables (`num`, `out`, `list1`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged throughout the loop as per the description.

### Final Output State:

- `num`: Remains the same as the initial state, a string representing a positive integer.
- `out`: Remains an empty list.
- `list2`: Contains the integer values of `list1[0]`, `list1[2]`, `list1[4]`, ..., `list1[2 * (a-1)]`.
- `list1`: Remains the same as the initial state, a sorted list of substrings from the input string `b`.
- `a`: Remains the same as the initial state, an integer equal to the integer value of the original string `num`.
- `b`: Remains the same as the initial state, the input string.

Output State: **`num` is a string representing a positive integer (1 ≤ int(num) ≤ 5000), `out` is an empty list, `list2` is a list containing the integer values of `list1[2 * j]` for all `j` from 0 to `a-1`, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from the input string `b`, `a` is an integer equal to the integer value of the original string `num` (1 ≤ a ≤ 5000), `b` is the input string.**
