The variable `r` is assigned the length of list `B`. Since `B` is `[0, 1]`, the length of `B` is `2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is `[0, 1, 3, 12]`; `idx_A` is `[0, 1, 2, 5]`; `B` is `[0, 1]`; `idx_B` is `[1, 0]`; `l` is `0`; `r` is `2`.

Output State: **`A` is `[0, 1, 3, 12]`; `idx_A` is `[0, 1, 2, 5]`; `B` is `[0, 1]`; `idx_B` is `[1, 0]`; `l` is `0`; `r` is `2`.**
