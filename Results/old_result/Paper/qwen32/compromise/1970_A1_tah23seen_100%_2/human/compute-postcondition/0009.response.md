To determine the output state, we need to understand how the loop processes the initial state. The loop iterates over a list of tuples `d`, where each tuple `(i, j)` represents an index `i` in the string `s` and a value `j` which is the balance of parentheses at that index. The list `d` is sorted by the balance of parentheses and then by the negative of the positions in the string.

Given that `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, the balance of parentheses at any index `i` can be defined as the difference between the number of opening parentheses `(` and closing parentheses `)` encountered from the start of the string up to index `i`.

The sorting criteria mean that tuples with lower balance values will be processed first, and in case of ties, the tuple with the higher index will be processed first. However, since `s` is a balanced sequence, the balance values will ensure that the parentheses are added in a way that maintains the balance.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s`: A balanced parentheses sequence.
   - `n`: Length of `s`.
   - `ans`: An empty string.
   - `d`: A list of tuples sorted by balance and negative position.

2. **Processing the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each tuple `(i, j)` in `d`.
   - For each tuple, it appends the character at index `i` of `s` to the string `ans`.

3. **Effect of the Loop:**
   - Since `d` is sorted by balance and then by negative position, the characters appended to `ans` will be in a specific order that maintains the balance of the parentheses.
   - However, because `s` is already a balanced sequence, appending characters from `s` in any order that respects the balance will still result in a balanced sequence.
   - Given the sorting criteria, the characters are added in such a way that the resulting sequence `ans` will be identical to the original sequence `s`.

Therefore, the output state will be the same as the initial string `s`.

Output State: **s**
