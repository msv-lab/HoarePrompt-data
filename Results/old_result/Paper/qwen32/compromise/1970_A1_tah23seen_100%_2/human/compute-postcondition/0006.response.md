Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary where `d[0]` is `0` and `d[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n-1` represents the balance of parentheses up to position `i` in the string `s`.**

Natural Language: The dictionary `d` no longer contains the key `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
