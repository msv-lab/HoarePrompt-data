Precondition: **Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of columns in the grid, followed by two binary strings of length n representing the top and bottom rows of the grid, respectively. The function will be called multiple times with different test cases, and the sum of n across all test cases will not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.**
