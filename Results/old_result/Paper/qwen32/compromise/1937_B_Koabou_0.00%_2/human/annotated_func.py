#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of columns in the grid, followed by two binary strings of length n representing the top and bottom rows of the grid, respectively. The function will be called multiple times with different test cases, and the sum of n across all test cases will not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer representing the number of columns in the grid, `a` is a list containing two binary strings of length `n` representing the top and bottom rows of the grid.
    s = []
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: `s` is either `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]` where `i` is the index where the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` is met, or `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]` if no such `i` is found; `x` is either the index `i` where the condition is met or `n - 1` if no such `i` is found.
    t = 1
    for i in range(x):
        if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: s is either a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:] where i is the index where the condition a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0' is met, or a[0] + a[1][n - 1] if no such i is found; x is either the index i where the condition is met or n - 1 if no such i is found; t is either 1 or x - i + 1 where the loop breaks.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: s (where s is constructed based on the conditions provided: either a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:] if an index i meets the condition a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0', or a[0] + a[1][n - 1] if no such i is found)
    print(t)
    #This is printed: 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n` representing the top and bottom rows of a grid. It then constructs and prints a new binary string `s` based on specific conditions related to the input strings. Additionally, it prints an integer `t` which is either 1 or a calculated value based on the constructed string `s`.
