The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the range it iterates over, which is determined by `x`. For the loop to execute, `x` must be greater than 0. The state of `s` and `t` does not affect the execution of the loop, so we only need to adjust `x`.

Here is the adjusted state:
State: **`s` is either `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]` where `i` is the index where the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` is met, or `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]` if no such `i` is found; `x` must be greater than 0; `t` is 1**
