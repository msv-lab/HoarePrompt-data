You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of columns in the grid, followed by two binary strings of length n representing the top and bottom rows of the grid, respectively. The function will be called multiple times with different test cases, and the sum of n across all test cases will not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer representing the number of columns in the grid, `a` is a list containing two binary strings of length `n` representing the top and bottom rows of the grid.
    s = []
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: `s` is either `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]` where `i` is the index where the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` is met, or `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]` if no such `i` is found; `x` is either the index `i` where the condition is met or `n - 1` if no such `i` is found.
    t = 1
    for i in range(x):
        if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: s is either a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:] where i is the index where the condition a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0' is met, or a[0] + a[1][n - 1] if no such i is found; x is either the index i where the condition is met or n - 1 if no such i is found; t is either 1 or x - i + 1 where the loop breaks.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: s (where s is constructed based on the conditions provided: either a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:] if an index i meets the condition a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0', or a[0] + a[1][n - 1] if no such i is found)
    print(t)
    #This is printed: 1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` (representing the number of columns in a grid) and two binary strings of length `n` (representing the top and bottom rows of the grid). It returns a value based on the relationship between the two binary strings.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
