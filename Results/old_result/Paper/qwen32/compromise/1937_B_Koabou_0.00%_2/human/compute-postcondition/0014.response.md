Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n` representing the top and bottom rows of a grid. It then constructs and prints a new binary string `s` based on specific conditions related to the input strings. Additionally, it prints an integer `t` which is either 1 or a calculated value based on the constructed string `s`.**
