The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `b`. Given the loop `for i in range(1, b + 1):`, the loop iterates `i` from 1 to `b` inclusive. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `b + 1`, which means the loop has just finished its last iteration (since the loop runs while `i` is less than `b + 1`). To execute one more time, `i` needs to be reset to the starting value of the loop, which is 1.

The variable `b` does not need to be adjusted because the loop's range is dependent on `b`, and `b` is already defined as at least 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `i` reset to 1.

State: **`info` is a new list of substrings based on the user's input, `b` is at least 1, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `i` is 1, `x` is calculated as \(\left(\frac{a - b^2 - b}{b^2 + 2b + 1}\right) + 1\)**
