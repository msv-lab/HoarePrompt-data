Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and is greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is 0, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0`, then `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i` is considered. Otherwise, no further changes are made.**
