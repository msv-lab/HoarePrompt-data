The given code snippet increments the value of `suma` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `suma` will be its previous value plus 1.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and is greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) + 1`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. Additionally, `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i`**
