Postcondition: **`info` is a new list of substrings based on the user's input, `b` is at least 1, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `i` is 1, `x` is `a + 1`. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is true, then `suma` is increased by `a + 2`. Otherwise, `suma` is increased by `a + 1`.**
