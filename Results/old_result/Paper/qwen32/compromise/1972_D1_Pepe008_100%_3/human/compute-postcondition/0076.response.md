Postcondition: **`info` is a new list of substrings based on the user's input, `b` is at least 1, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `i` is 2, `x` is `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0`, then `suma` is increased by `((a - 2) // 4 + 1) + 1` if `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i` is not zero. Otherwise, `suma` remains unchanged.**
