The code `info = input().split()` takes an input string from the user and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace. This means that the `info` variable, which was previously a list of substrings, will be updated to a new list of substrings based on the user's input. The other variables (`t`, `T`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `suma`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`info` is a new list of substrings based on the user's input; `t` is `b + 3`; `T` is greater than 0; `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`; `b` is at least 1; `i` is `b + 1`; `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated in each iteration where `x > 0`.**
