To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand how the variables are defined and used in the context of the provided print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `T` is greater than 0.
3. `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input.
4. `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`.
5. `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`.
6. `i` is defined as `b + 1`.
7. `suma` is the accumulated sum after all iterations of the loop.

### Key Points:
- The value of `suma` is not explicitly given in the initial state, but it is the result of some accumulation process (likely within a loop).
- The print statement outputs `suma - 2`.

### Analysis:
Since the exact value of `suma` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `suma`. The print statement will subtract 2 from the accumulated sum `suma` and print the result.

### Final Output Description:
The code prints the value of `suma` minus 2. Since the exact value of `suma` is not specified, we describe it as the accumulated sum after all iterations of the loop.

Output: **suma - 2 (where suma is the accumulated sum after all iterations of the loop)**
