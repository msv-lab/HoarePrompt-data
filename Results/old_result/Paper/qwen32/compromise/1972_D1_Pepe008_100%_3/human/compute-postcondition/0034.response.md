The code snippet `suma += x` increments the value of `suma` by the value of `x`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`info` is a list of substrings, `t` is `b + 2`, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is `b + 1`, `suma` is `x`, `x` is `(a - b * (b + 1)) // (b + 1)`**. 

In natural language: The value of `suma` has been updated to be equal to `x`, which is calculated as `(a - b * (b + 1)) // (b + 1)`. All other variables retain their initial values.
