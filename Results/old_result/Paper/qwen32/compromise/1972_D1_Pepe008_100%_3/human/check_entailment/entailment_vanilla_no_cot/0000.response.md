Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for calculating the number of valid pairs (a, b) based on the conditions provided is flawed. The program seems to be attempting to count pairs where `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`, but the implementation is incorrect.

To solve the problem correctly, one would need to iterate through all possible pairs (a, b) within the given ranges and check if `a + b` is divisible by `b * gcd(a, b)`. The provided program uses a different approach that does not accurately count the valid pairs based on the problem's requirements.
