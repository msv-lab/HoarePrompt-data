To determine if the provided program is correct, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally given Nene's optimal play.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective:** Maximize your score by playing optimally.
2. **Nene's Strategy:** Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score.
3. **Game Mechanics:**
   - Cards are distributed between you and Nene such that each player has `n` cards.
   - Each card has a number from 1 to `n` and each number appears exactly twice in the deck.
   - Players take turns placing their cards on the table.
   - You score 1 point if the card you place has already been placed on the table.

### Key Insight:
- The maximum score you can achieve is determined by the number of pairs of cards you have in your hand because:
  - If you have a pair, you can place one card, and if Nene doesn't place the other card of the same pair on the table in the next turn, you can place the second card and score 1 point.
  - Since Nene plays optimally, she will try to prevent you from scoring as much as possible, but the optimal strategy for you is to maximize the number of pairs you can complete.

### Solution Logic:
- Count the number of pairs in your hand (`pairs`).
- The maximum number of points you can score is the minimum of `pairs` and `n // 2` because:
  - Even if you have more pairs than `n // 2`, you can only make `n // 2` moves.

### Program Analysis:
- `func_1(n, a)`:
  - Uses `collections.Counter` to count occurrences of each card number.
  - Counts the number of pairs in the hand.
  - Returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`.
- `func_2()`:
  - Reads input data for multiple test cases.
  - Calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the results.
  - Prints the results for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally. It correctly calculates the number of pairs in your hand and ensures that the result does not exceed `n // 2`.

### Your response:
Correctness: **True**
