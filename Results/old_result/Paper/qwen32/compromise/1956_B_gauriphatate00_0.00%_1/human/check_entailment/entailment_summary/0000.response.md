### Reasoning:

The provided problem describes a card game where you and Nene each have `n` cards, and the goal is to maximize your score by selecting cards in such a way that you get points when you place a card that already has a matching card on the table. Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

Let's analyze the provided functions:

1. **Function `func_1(n, a)`**:
   - **Purpose**: To determine the maximum number of points you can get.
   - **Logic**: It counts the number of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand (`pairs`). The function then returns the minimum of `pairs` and `n // 2`. This makes sense because:
     - `pairs` represents the maximum number of matches you can make if all pairs are between your cards and Neneâ€™s cards.
     - `n // 2` is the maximum number of turns you have, so you can't make more matches than the number of turns you get.
   - **Output**: The minimum of the number of pairs you have and the number of turns you get (`n // 2`).

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - **Purpose**: To read multiple test cases from standard input and apply `func_1` to each test case.
   - **Logic**: 
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of integers `a`.
     - It calls `func_1(n, a)` to compute the result for each test case and stores it.
     - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
   - **Output**: Prints the maximum number of points you can get for each test case.

### Analysis of Correctness:

The logic in `func_1` seems to correctly determine the maximum number of points you can get based on the problem description. Since Nene plays optimally, she would take any card that prevents you from getting a point whenever possible. However, the problem simplifies to counting the number of pairs you can make, which aligns with the function's logic.

The function `func_2` correctly handles the input and output requirements, applying `func_1` to each test case.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the provided functions together meet the problem description. The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can get, and `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases.

**Correctness: True**
