The provided code snippet does not actually modify the variables `n`, `a`, `data`, `idx`, or `t` within the loop. The loop simply iterates over the `results` list and prints each `result`. Therefore, the values of `n`, `a`, `data`, `idx`, and `t` remain unchanged after the loop finishes executing.

The only change is that the contents of `results` will have been printed to the console. However, the state of `results` itself remains the same.

Output State: **n is the number of cards from the last iteration, a is the list of integers from the last iteration, data is the same list of substrings, idx is incremented by 1 + sum(n for each iteration) + t, t is unchanged, results is a list of results from func_1(n, a) for each iteration.**
