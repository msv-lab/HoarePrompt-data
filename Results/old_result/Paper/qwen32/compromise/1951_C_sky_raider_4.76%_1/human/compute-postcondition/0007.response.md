The code assigns the variable `s` the minimum value between `m` and `k`. Since the initial state does not specify the values of `m` and `k`, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `s`. However, we know that `s` will be equal to the smaller of `m` and `k`.

The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.**
