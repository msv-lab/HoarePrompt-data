The given code snippet modifies the variable `c` by adding the expression `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to its current value. 

Given the initial state, `c` was already updated once before the code snippet to `c + 2 * (l[i] * s - s * s / 2)`. After executing the provided code snippet, `c` will be further updated.

Let's break down the changes:
- `c` is initially updated to `c + 2 * (l[i] * s - s * s / 2)`.
- The code snippet then updates `c` again by adding `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`.

Thus, the final value of `c` will be the initial value plus three times the expression `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`.

Other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `s`, `i`) remain unchanged except for `c`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `m` is set according to user input, `k` is `k - 2s - s`, `l` is set according to user input, `c` is updated to `c + 3 * (l[i] * s - s * s / 2)`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `i` is `i + 1`.**
