Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9), representing the number of sale days, the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, and the number of tickets to be bought, respectively. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days. The total number of n across all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l.sort()
    s = 0
    c = k * k / 2
    for i in range(n):
        s = min(m, k)
        k -= s
        c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2
    print(int(c))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `m`, `l` unchanged; `k` is reduced by the sum of all `s` values across iterations; `c` is updated to `k * k / 2 + sum(l[i] * s_i - s_i * s_i / 2 for i in range(n))`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n`, `k` is reduced by the sum of all `s` values across iterations, `c` is updated by adding `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` in the last iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` remains the same, `m` remains the same, `k` is reduced by the sum of all `s` values, `i` is `n`, `c` is updated by the sum of `l[i] * s_i - s_i * s_i / 2` for each iteration, `s` is the minimum of `m` and the final `k`, `l` remains the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
