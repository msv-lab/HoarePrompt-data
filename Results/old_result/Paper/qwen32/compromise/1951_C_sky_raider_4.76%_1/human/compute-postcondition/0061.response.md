Functionality: **The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, representing the number of sale days, the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, and the number of tickets to be bought, respectively. It also accepts a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming `n` days. The function returns the minimum cost required to buy `k` tickets, considering the constraints on the number of tickets that can be purchased each day.**
