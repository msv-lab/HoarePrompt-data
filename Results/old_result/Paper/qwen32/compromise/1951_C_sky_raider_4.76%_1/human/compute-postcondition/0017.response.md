To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1`
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `s` is `min(m, k)`
- `k` is `k - min(m, k)`

Code Snippet:
```python
c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2
```

This line modifies the variable `c` by adding the result of the expression `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`.

Impact on Variables:
- `c` is updated to `c + (l[i] * s - s * s / 2)`.
- `i`, `n`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State:
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1` (precondition still holds).
- `i` is `i + 1` (unchanged).
- `s` is `min(m, k)` (unchanged).
- `k` is `k - min(m, k)` (unchanged).
- `c` is updated to `c + (l[i] * s - s * s / 2)`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `s` is `min(m, k)`; `k` is `k - min(m, k)`; `c` is `c + (l[i] * s - s * s / 2)`**.
