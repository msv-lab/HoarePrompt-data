To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(c))` statement, let's break down the components involved in calculating `c`.

### Given Information:
- `n`, `m`, `l` are unchanged.
- `k` is reduced by the sum of all `s` values across iterations.
- `c` is updated to `k * k / 2 + sum(l[i] * s_i - s_i * s_i / 2 for i in range(n))`.

### Calculation of `c`:
The expression for `c` is:
\[ c = \frac{k \times k}{2} + \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (l[i] \times s_i - \frac{s_i \times s_i}{2}) \]

Let's break it down further:

1. **First Term**: \(\frac{k \times k}{2}\)
   - This term is simply half of the square of `k`.

2. **Second Term**: \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (l[i] \times s_i - \frac{s_i \times s_i}{2})\)
   - This term involves iterating over the range from 0 to \(n-1\) and for each `i`, computing \(l[i] \times s_i - \frac{s_i \times s_i}{2}\).
   - The sum of these individual computations gives the second part of `c`.

### Final Value of `c`:
The final value of `c` is the sum of the two terms above. Since the exact values of `k`, `n`, `l`, and `s_i` are not provided, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `c`. However, we can describe it precisely in terms of the given variables.

### Output:
The `print(int(c))` statement will print the integer part of `c` after performing the calculations described above.

Output: **int(c) (where c is calculated as (k * k / 2) + sum(l[i] * s_i - s_i * s_i / 2 for i in range(n)))**
