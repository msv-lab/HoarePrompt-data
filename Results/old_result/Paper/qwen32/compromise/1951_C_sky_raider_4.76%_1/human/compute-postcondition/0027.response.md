Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `m`, `k`, `l`, `c` are set according to user input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.**

This means that the value of `s` has been updated to be the smaller of the two values `m` and `k`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `c`) retain their initial values as specified by the user input.
