Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down why this is the case.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost (`c`)**:
   - The variable `c` is initialized as `k * k / 2`, which doesn't make sense in the context of calculating the total cost of tickets.
   - The update to `c` inside the loop is also incorrect. The formula `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` is not aligned with the problem's requirement to calculate the total cost of purchasing tickets considering the increasing prices.

2. **Logic for Purchasing Tickets**:
   - The program attempts to purchase up to `m` tickets each day but does not account for the fact that the number of tickets to be purchased (`k`) might be less than `m`.
   - The decrement of `k` by `s` is correct, but the calculation of `s` as `min(m, k)` is not used correctly in the cost calculation.

3. **Handling of Remaining Tickets**:
   - If `k` becomes zero before the loop ends, the program does not stop purchasing tickets, which could lead to unnecessary calculations.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
- Sort the prices in ascending order.
- Iterate through the sorted prices and purchase tickets each day until we have purchased `k` tickets.
- Keep track of the cumulative cost, taking into account the increasing prices due to previous purchases.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        prices.sort()
        
        total_cost = 0
        tickets_bought = 0
        increase = 0
        
        for price in prices:
            if tickets_bought >= k:
                break
            # Calculate how many tickets we can buy today
            tickets_today = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
            total_cost += tickets_today * (price + increase)
            tickets_bought += tickets_today
            increase += tickets_today
        
        print(total_cost)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program

- **Sorting**: The prices are sorted in ascending order to ensure we buy the cheapest tickets first.
- **Loop Through Prices**: We iterate through the sorted prices and buy up to `m` tickets each day, but only as many as we need to reach `k` tickets.
- **Cost Calculation**: The cost for each day is calculated as `tickets_today * (price + increase)`, where `increase` is the cumulative increase in price due to previous purchases.
- **Break Condition**: The loop breaks once we have purchased `k` tickets.

This corrected approach ensures that we always buy the cheapest available tickets while accounting for the increasing prices, leading to the minimum total cost.
