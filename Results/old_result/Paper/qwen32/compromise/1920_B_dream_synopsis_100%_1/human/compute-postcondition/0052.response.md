Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers with `k` being at least 0, `a` is a new list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is not equal to 0, and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`.**
