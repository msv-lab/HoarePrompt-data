Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers with `k` being at least 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`. If `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `sums` is updated as follows: if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` becomes `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` becomes `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
