The provided code snippet only initializes an empty list named `ans`. No other variables are modified, and no calculations or assignments are performed that would affect the existing variables.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same except for the initialization of `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a new list of `n` integers read from the input and sorted in descending order; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is an empty list.**
