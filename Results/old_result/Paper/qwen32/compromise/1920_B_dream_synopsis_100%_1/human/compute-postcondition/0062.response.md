The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `i`, and `sums` remain unchanged. The only change is that `ans` now contains two elements: the original `sums` and the newly appended `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers with `k` being at least 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the values `[sums, sums]`, `i` is 3, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
