The code reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged. 

Given that `n` represents the number of integers expected in the input, `a` will be a list containing exactly `n` integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input.**
