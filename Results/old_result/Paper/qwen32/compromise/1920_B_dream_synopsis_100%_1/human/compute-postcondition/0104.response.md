Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` and the newly appended `sums`, `i` is incremented by 1, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `sums` has been appended to the list `ans`. All other variables retain their previous values except for `ans`, which now includes the new value of `sums`.
