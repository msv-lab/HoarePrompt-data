Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed (now descending) list of `n` integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is `i + 2`. If `i == 0`, `ans` is a list containing three elements `[sums, sums, sums]` where `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i + x - 1 < n`, `ans` is a list containing three elements, the first two being `sums` and the third being `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, `ans` is a list containing three elements `[sums + a[i - 1], sums, sums]`. `sums` is updated accordingly based on the conditions.**
