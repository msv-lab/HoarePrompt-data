The code snippet adds the element at index `i - 1` of the list `a` to the variable `sums`. Since `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, the value being added to `sums` is `a[i - 1]`.

Given that `sums` was not defined in the initial state, we assume it was initialized to 0 before this line of code was executed.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n`, `k` must be at least 0, `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is an empty list, and `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`. `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
