Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers with `k` being at least 0, `a` is a new list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is not equal to 0, and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`; `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
