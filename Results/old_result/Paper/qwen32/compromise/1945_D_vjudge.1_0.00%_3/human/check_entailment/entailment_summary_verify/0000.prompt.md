You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases from the input and executes the function `func_1` for each test case.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Kirill is at the end of a queue of `n` people.
- Kirill wants to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue.
- For each person at position `i`, Kirill can bribe them to swap places and will pay `a_i` coins to that person.
- Additionally, for each person between the bribe target and Kirill's original position, Kirill will pay `b_k` coins.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach one of the first `m` positions.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1`: This function handles a single test case.
2. `func_2`: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

#### `func_1` Analysis:
- The function reads `n` (number of people) and `k` (target position, which should be `m` as per the problem statement, but it's `k` in the code).
- It reads two lists: `lista_A` and `lista_B`, which represent `a_i` and `b_i` values, respectively.
- The lists are reversed, which is not necessary and might be confusing.
- The program calculates the minimum cost to move Kirill to one of the first `m` positions by iterating through the reversed lists and calculating the prefix sums of `b_i` values.
- The program keeps track of the minimum cost found.

#### Potential Issues:
1. **Reversing Lists**: Reversing the lists is unnecessary and can introduce errors if the logic is not adjusted accordingly.
2. **Variable Naming**: The variable `k` is used instead of `m`, which is a minor issue but can be confusing.
3. **Logic for Cost Calculation**: The logic for calculating the cost seems correct, but the reversal of lists might affect the correctness.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the provided example to see if it works correctly.

#### Example Test Case:
```
4
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
6 2
6 9 7 1 8 3
5 8 8 1 4 1
7 7
7 2 9 2 6 5 9
9 1 10 7 1 4 9
2 1
2 3
1 1
```

#### Expected Output:
```
14
22
9
3
```

Let's run the program with this test case and see if it produces the expected output.

### Conclusion:
After running the program with the provided example, if it produces the correct output, then it seems to be handling the test case correctly. However, the reversal of lists might introduce issues in other cases.

#### Reversal of Lists:
Reversing the lists can lead to incorrect calculations because the logic assumes the lists are in the original order. For example, if we have:
```
n = 4, m = 2
a = [7, 3, 6, 9]
b = [4, 3, 8, 5]
```
Reversing these lists would result in:
```
a = [9, 6, 3, 7]
b = [5, 8, 3, 4]
```
This would lead to incorrect cost calculations because the indices do not match the original positions.

### Final Answer:
Given the potential issue with reversing the lists, the program is not guaranteed to work correctly for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The reversal of the lists in the program can lead to incorrect cost calculations because the indices do not match the original positions in the queue. This can cause the program to produce incorrect results for some test cases.
