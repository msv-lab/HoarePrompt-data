You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
- **Kirill** is at the end of a queue of `n` people.
- **Objective**: Move Kirill to one of the first `m` positions in the queue while minimizing the cost.
- **Cost Calculation**:
  - If Kirill swaps with the person at position `j`, he pays `a_j` coins.
  - For each person between `j` and `i` (where `i` is Kirill's current position), he pays `b_k` coins.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1`: Handles a single test case.
2. `func_2`: Handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

#### `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Input Reading and Reversing**:
   - Reads `n` and `m` (renamed as `k` in the code).
   - Reads `a_i` and `b_i` values and reverses both lists.
   - **Reasoning**: Reversing the lists makes it easier to work from the end of the queue towards the front, which aligns with Kirill's objective of moving from the end to one of the first `m` positions.

2. **Initial Cost Calculation (`soma_b`)**:
   - Initializes `soma_b` to 0, which will accumulate the cost of moving past people.
   - Iterates through the first `n - k` people (positions that Kirill can potentially swap with to reach one of the first `m` positions).
   - **Decision Making**:
     - If `a_i < b_i` for the `i-th` person, it adds the accumulated `soma_b` and `a_i` to `pref` (the prefix cost), and resets `soma_b` to 0.
     - Otherwise, it adds `b_i` to `soma_b`.

3. **Final Cost Calculation**:
   - Initializes `resultado` to infinity.
   - Iterates through the last `k` people (positions that Kirill can potentially end up in).
   - For each position, it calculates the total cost as `pref + soma_b + a_i` and updates `resultado` with the minimum cost.
   - Adds `b_i` to `soma_b` after each iteration.

4. **Output**:
   - Prints the minimum cost `resultado`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Reversing Lists**: The reversal of lists simplifies the problem by allowing us to work from the end of the queue towards the front, which is consistent with the problem's requirements.
- **Cost Calculation**:
  - The algorithm correctly accumulates the cost of moving past people (`soma_b`) and the cost of swapping (`a_i`).
  - The decision to add `a_i` and `soma_b` to `pref` when `a_i < b_i` ensures that Kirill only pays the minimum necessary cost for each swap.
  - The final loop calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to reach one of the first `m` positions.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach one of the first `m` positions in the queue.

**Correctness:** **True**
