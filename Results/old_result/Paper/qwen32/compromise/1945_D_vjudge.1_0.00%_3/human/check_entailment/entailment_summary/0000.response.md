### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue. Kirill can bribe people ahead of him to swap positions, paying `a_i` to person `i` and `b_k` for each person `k` between `i` and Kirill's current position.

Let's break down the provided functions and see if they meet the problem requirements:

#### `func_1`:
- **Input**: `n` (number of people in the queue excluding Kirill), `m` (maximum allowable final position of Kirill), `a` (costs to bribe individuals), `b` (additional costs to bribe through others).
- **Process**:
  - The lists `a` and `b` are reversed.
  - The function calculates the minimum cost to move Kirill to one of the first `m` positions.
  - It uses a prefix sum approach to keep track of the cumulative cost of bribes and additional costs.
  - It iterates through the reversed lists, updating the prefix sum and calculating the minimum cost.
- **Output**: The minimum number of coins Kirill has to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue.

#### `func_2`:
- **Input**: The number of test cases.
- **Process**: For each test case, it calls `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost.
- **Output**: The minimum cost for each test case is printed.

### Analysis:
- **Reversing the Lists**: The reversal of lists `a` and `b` in `func_1` is a bit unusual and might be a mistake. The problem description does not suggest reversing the lists. Instead, the approach should consider the original order of the queue.
- **Logic**: The logic in `func_1` seems to be an attempt to calculate the minimum cost using a prefix sum approach, but it might not correctly implement the problem's requirements due to the list reversal.
- **Correctness**: Given the list reversal, the logic might not correctly compute the minimum cost as described in the problem. The correct approach should consider the original order of the queue and calculate the minimum cost accordingly.

### Conclusion:
The program is **incorrect** due to the list reversal in `func_1`, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

**Correctness: False**
