It appears that there is a missing detail in the initial state provided for the task. The initial state mentions `t`, but the print statement refers to `fnd`. There is no information about the variable `fnd` in the initial state. To proceed, I'll assume that `fnd` is a variable that has been defined somewhere in the code or is part of the initial state that was not included in the provided information.

Since the initial state does not provide any information about `fnd`, we cannot determine its value explicitly. Therefore, I'll describe the output in terms of `fnd`.

Output: **fnd (where fnd is a variable whose value is not explicitly provided in the initial state)**
