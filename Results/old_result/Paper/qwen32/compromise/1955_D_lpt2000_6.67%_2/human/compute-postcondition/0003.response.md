The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each of these components to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `aa`. This means `aa` is now a list of integers, and the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `nabors` remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by subsequent code (which is not provided here).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^6, `b` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^6, `nabors` is greater than or equal to 1, `aa` is a list of integers read from the input.**
