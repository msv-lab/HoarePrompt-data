Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^6, `b` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^6, `nabors` is greater than or equal to 1, `aa` is a list of integers read from the input, `bb` is a list of integers read from the input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `bb`, `D` is a Counter object that contains the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` with values being the minimum of the counts from `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` for each key, except if `C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]` then the count of `in_aa` in `D` is incremented by 1, `E` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of elements in `cnt_aa` after subtracting the counts of elements in `D` with the count of `out_aa` adjusted based on the if condition, `C` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of elements in `cnt_bb` after subtracting the counts of elements in `D` with the count of `out_aa` adjusted based on the if condition, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D` adjusted based on the if condition, `fnd` is 3 if `tot` >= `k` else 2, `in_aa` is the next element from `aa[m + i]`, and `out_aa` is the next element from `aa[j]`. If `C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]`, then `C[in_aa]` is incremented by 1.**
