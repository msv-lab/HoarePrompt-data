To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand the changes made to the variables within the loop. Let's break down the loop:

1. The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
2. In each iteration, the variable `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`.
3. The variable `path` is updated to the string `data[index + 1]`.
4. The function `func_1(path)` is called with the current `path`, and its result is appended to the `results` list.
5. The variable `index` is incremented by 2 after each iteration to move to the next pair of `n` and `path`.

Given the initial state:
- `path` is a string of space-separated integers.
- `n` is an integer representing the number of signs.
- `data` is a list of strings.
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
- `index` is 1.
- `results` is an empty list.

After the loop executes:
- `t` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- `index` will be `1 + 2 * t` because it is incremented by 2 in each of the `t` iterations.
- `path` and `n` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop.
- `results` will contain the results of `func_1(path)` for each iteration.

Therefore, the output state will be:

Output State: **`path` is the last path string processed, `n` is the last integer representing the number of signs processed, `data` remains the same, `t` remains the same, `index` is `1 + 2 * t`, `results` is a list of results from `func_1(path)` for each iteration.**
