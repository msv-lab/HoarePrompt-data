The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are modified in the given code, so their values remain as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`path` is a string of space-separated integers representing the periodicities of the signs, `n` is an integer representing the number of signs such that 1 <= n <= 100, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line by spaces, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list.**
