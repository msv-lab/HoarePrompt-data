You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: path is a string of space-separated integers representing the periodicities of the signs, and n is an integer representing the number of signs such that 1 <= n <= 100.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        path = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        results.append(func_1(path))
        
    #State: `path` is the last path string processed, `n` is the last integer representing the number of signs processed, `data` remains the same, `t` remains the same, `index` is `1 + 2 * t`, `results` is a list of results from `func_1(path)` for each iteration.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: path is the last path string processed, n is the last integer representing the number of signs processed, data remains the same, t remains the same, index is 1 + 2 * t, results is a list of results from func_1(path) for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `path` of space-separated integers representing the periodicities of the signs and an integer `n` representing the number of signs. It returns a calculated result based on these inputs.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
