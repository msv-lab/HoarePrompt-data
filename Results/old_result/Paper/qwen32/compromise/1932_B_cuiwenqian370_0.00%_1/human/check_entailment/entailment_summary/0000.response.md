Reasoning:  
The provided problem and the execution summaries for the given functions do not match. The problem requires a solution that calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs, considering the sequential nature of the signs and their periodicities. However, the given functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) appear to be solving a completely different problem related to counting the maximum number of '@' characters in a path without encountering a '*'.

The code for `func_1` and `func_2` is not relevant to the problem described, and there is no function provided that calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs based on the periodicities given in the problem statement.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect for the problem described.

Correctness: **False**
