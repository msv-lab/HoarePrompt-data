Reasoning:
The provided code is not relevant to the problem described. The code given seems to be solving a different problem, possibly related to some kind of path analysis with '@' and '*' characters, rather than calculating the year when the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur based on the given periodicities.

The problem requires us to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given that each sign must occur sequentially, with the i-th sign occurring in years that are multiples of a_i, and the (i+1)-th sign occurring after the i-th sign has occurred.

The correct approach to solve this problem would involve iterating over each sign and finding the next occurrence of the current sign after the previous sign has occurred. Here's a correct implementation of the solution:

```python
def find_apocalypse_year(n, periods):
    current_year = 0
    for period in periods:
        # Find the next occurrence of the sign after the current_year
        next_occurrence = current_year + period - (current_year % period)
        if current_year % period != 0:
            next_occurrence += period
        current_year = next_occurrence
    return current_year

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        periods = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        results.append(find_apocalypse_year(n, periods))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code reads the input, processes each test case, and calculates the year when the n-th sign will occur by iterating through each sign and determining the next valid occurrence year.

Since the given code does not match the problem requirements, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
