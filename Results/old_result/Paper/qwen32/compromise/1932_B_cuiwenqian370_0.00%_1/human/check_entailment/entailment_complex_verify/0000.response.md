### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not align with the problem description. Let's break down the issues systematically:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to process a path consisting of characters `@` and `*`. It calculates the maximum number of `@` characters that can be encountered without encountering a `*`. This is entirely unrelated to the problem of finding the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse occurs.
   - The function does not handle the periodicities of the signs as required by the problem description. It does not compute the year in which each sign occurs based on the previous sign's occurrence year.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input and processes multiple test cases. However, it uses `func_1` to process each test case, which is incorrect because `func_1` is not designed for this purpose.
   - The function reads the input in a way that assumes each test case's path is a single string, whereas the problem description specifies that the second line of each test case contains `n` integers, not a single string.

3. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the behavior of `func_1` and `func_2` based on the given code. They show that `func_1` processes a path of characters and `func_2` reads input and applies `func_1` to each test case.
   - The annotations do not reflect any part of the logic needed to solve the problem of finding the year in which the n-th sign occurs based on the given periodicities.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, the program should iterate through each test case, and for each test case, it should iterate through the signs, calculating the year each sign occurs based on the previous sign's occurrence year.
   - The corrected version of the code provided in the original assessment correctly implements this logic.

### Final Evaluation:

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not solve the problem as described.

**Final: False**
