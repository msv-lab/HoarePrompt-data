You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not align with the problem description. The problem requires finding the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given the periodicities of the signs. The provided code, however, appears to be related to a different problem involving a path with '@' and '*' characters, and it does not handle the input and output requirements specified in the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of why the code is incorrect:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function seems to be solving a problem related to a path with '@' and '*' characters, which is unrelated to the given problem. It calculates some form of score based on the path, but it does not compute the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads input and processes multiple test cases, but it uses `func_1` to process each test case, which is incorrect as explained above. It also reads the input in a way that assumes each test case's path is a single string, which is not the case in the problem description. The problem description specifies that the second line of each test case contains `n` integers, not a single string.

To correctly solve the problem, the code should iterate through each test case, and for each test case, it should iterate through the signs, calculating the year each sign occurs based on the previous sign's occurrence year. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def find_apocalypse_year(signs):
    current_year = 0
    for period in signs:
        # Find the next occurrence of the sign
        next_occurrence = ((current_year // period) + 1) * period
        current_year = next_occurrence
    return current_year

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        signs = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        results.append(find_apocalypse_year(signs))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected code reads the input correctly, processes each test case, and calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs based on the periodicities provided.
