The code snippet `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` modifies the `mp` dictionary by appending the value of `i` to the list associated with the key `pf[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n` and `pf[i]` is `pf[n]`, which is `pf[i - 1]` or `pf[n - 1]`.

Since `mp` is a defaultdict, if `pf[n]` does not exist as a key in `mp`, it will be created with an empty list as its value, and then `n` will be appended to this list. If `pf[n]` already exists, `n` will simply be appended to the existing list.

The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[index])`; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `n + 8`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries (either 'YES' or 'NO'); `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1]`; `mp` is a defaultdict with the key `0` mapping to the list `[0, i]` if `pf[i]` is `0`, or with an additional key `pf[i]` mapping to the list `[i]` if `pf[i]` is not `0`, and now `mp[pf[i]]` includes `i` at the end of its list; `i` is `n`**. The list associated with the key `pf[n]` in `mp` now includes `n` at the end of its list.
