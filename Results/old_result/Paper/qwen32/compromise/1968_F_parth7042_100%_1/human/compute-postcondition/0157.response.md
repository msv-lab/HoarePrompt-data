Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2; `n` is the integer value of `data[2n + 2q + 5]`; `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `2n + 2q + 7`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries (either 'YES' or 'NO'); `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `mp` is a defaultdict where each key is a unique XOR value from `pf` and maps to a list of indices `i` where that XOR value was achieved.**

The code snippet `mp = defaultdict(list)` reassigns `mp` to a new defaultdict object, which means it clears any previous mappings and initializes it for storing lists as values for each unique XOR key. All other variables remain unchanged.
