Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` minus 2 and must be greater than or equal to 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` are the integer values of `data[3]` to `data[n + 2]`; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `n + 9`; `results` is `['YES', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES']` if `x` was initially 0 and `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, otherwise `results` is `['YES', 'NO', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES']` if `x` is 0, and `['NO', 'YES', 'YES']` if `x` is not 0 and `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, otherwise `results` is `['NO', 'NO', 'YES']` if `x` is not 0; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[0]` is 0 and `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` are the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`; `mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and `mp[0]` is `[0]`, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list of indices `i` where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR up to that point; `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is the insertion point in `v1` where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order; `it2` is the largest index in `v2` where the value is less than `r`**.

In natural language: The `results` list now has an additional element `'YES'` appended to it. All other variables remain unchanged.
