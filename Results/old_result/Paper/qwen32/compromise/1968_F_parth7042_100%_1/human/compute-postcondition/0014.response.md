The code snippet assigns the value of `data[index]` (where `index` is 3) to the `i`-th element of the list `a`. Given that `i` is not explicitly defined in the code snippet, we can infer that `i` is a variable that should be defined elsewhere in the code. However, since `i` is not provided, we'll assume `i` is a valid index for the list `a` (which has `n + 1` elements).

Since `index` is 3, `a[i]` will be assigned the integer value of `data[3]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `data`, `index`, `results`, `pf`, and `mp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is the integer value of `data[3]`, `data` is unchanged, `index` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and `mp[0]` is `[0]`.**
