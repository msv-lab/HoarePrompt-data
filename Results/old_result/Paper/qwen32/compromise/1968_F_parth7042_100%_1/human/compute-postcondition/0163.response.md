The given code snippet appends the index `i` to the list in the dictionary `mp` where the key is `pf[i]`. This means that the list associated with the key `pf[i]` in the dictionary `mp` will now include the index `i` as an additional element.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2; `n` must be at least 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[index])`; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `2n + 2q + 8`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries (either 'YES' or 'NO'); `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ int(data[index])`; `mp` is a defaultdict where each key is a unique XOR value from `pf` and maps to a list of indices `i` where that XOR value was achieved, and `mp[0]` is now `[0]`; `mp[pf[i]]` includes `i` as an additional element in its list.**
