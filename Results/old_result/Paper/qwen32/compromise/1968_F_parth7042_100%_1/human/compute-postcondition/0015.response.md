Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is the integer value of `data[3]`, `data` is unchanged, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and `mp[0]` is `[0]`.**

Explanation: The only change is that the value of `index` has been incremented by 1, making it 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
