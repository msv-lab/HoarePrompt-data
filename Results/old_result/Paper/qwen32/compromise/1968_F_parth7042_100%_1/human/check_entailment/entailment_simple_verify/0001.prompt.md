You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's break down the logic and compare it with the problem requirements step-by-step.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input**:
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of elements in the array.
     - `q`: Number of queries.
     - `a`: Array of `n` integers.
     - `q` queries, each defined by a pair of integers `l` and `r`.

2. **Output**:
   - For each query, output "YES" if the subarray `a[l:r+1]` can be divided into `k > 1` parts such that the bitwise XOR of all elements in each part is equal. Otherwise, output "NO".

### Program Explanation:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads all the input at once and stores it in the `data` list.
   - It then processes the input for each test case.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - For each test case, it calculates the prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`.
   - A dictionary `mp` is used to store the indices where each prefix XOR value appears.

3. **Processing Queries**:
   - For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` using the prefix XOR array: `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.
   - If `x` is `0`, it means the subarray can be divided into `k > 1` parts with equal XOR (all parts having XOR `0`), so it outputs "YES".
   - Otherwise, it checks if there exists an index `i` in the range `[l, r]` such that `pf[i] = pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]` (i.e., `x`). This is done using binary search (`bisect_left`) on the list of indices stored in `mp[x]`.
   - If such an index exists and is in the correct range, it outputs "YES". Otherwise, it outputs "NO".

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - The prefix XOR array `pf` is correctly calculated for each test case.
   - The dictionary `mp` correctly stores the indices where each prefix XOR value appears.

2. **Query Processing**:
   - The XOR of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` is correctly calculated using `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.
   - The check for `x == 0` is correct, as it indicates that the subarray can be divided into parts with XOR `0`.
   - The binary search (`bisect_left`) is used to find an index `i` in the range `[l, r]` such that `pf[i] = x`. This index represents a potential split point where the subarray can be divided into parts with equal XOR.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `x == 0` correctly.
   - The binary search ensures that the index `i` is within the range `[l, r]`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if a subarray can be divided into parts with equal XOR. It efficiently handles the input constraints and provides the correct output for each query.

**Correctness: True**
