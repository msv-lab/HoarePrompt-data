### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by determining if a given subarray can be divided into two or more parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal. The program uses a prefix XOR approach combined with binary search to efficiently answer each query.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the program's logic:
1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: For each test case, the program calculates the prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to the `i-th` element. This allows for quick calculation of the XOR of any subarray.
2. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values**: A dictionary `mp` is used to map each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where this value occurs. This helps in quickly finding indices where the prefix XOR is the same.
3. **Query Handling**: For each query defined by `l` and `r`, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r` using the prefix XOR array. If the XOR is zero, the subarray can be trivially divided into parts with the same XOR (by taking each element as a separate part).
4. **Checking for Divisibility**: If the XOR of the subarray is not zero, the program checks if there exists a valid division by finding appropriate indices in the `mp` dictionary. Specifically, it looks for an index `i` in the range `[l, r]` where the prefix XOR value matches `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`. This indicates that the subarray from `l` to `i` can be one part, and the subarray from `i+1` to `r` can be another part with the same XOR value.
5. **Binary Search**: The `bisect_left` function is used to efficiently find the appropriate indices in the lists stored in the `mp` dictionary.

### Analysis:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray can be divided into parts with the same XOR value. It efficiently handles the constraints by using prefix XOR and binary search, ensuring that the solution is both correct and performant.

### Conclusion:

Based on the reasoning above, the program is correct for the given problem description and execution summary.
