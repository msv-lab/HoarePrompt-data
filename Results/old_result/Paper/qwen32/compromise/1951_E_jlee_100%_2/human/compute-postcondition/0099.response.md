Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`, `string` is the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `count2` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of any variables. Thus, all the initial conditions remain valid except for the fact that the loop or if statement is exited.
