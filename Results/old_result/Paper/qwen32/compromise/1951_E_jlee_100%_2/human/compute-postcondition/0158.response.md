Output State: **The loop has completed all `n` iterations without setting `done` to `True`. The variables `t`, `i`, `done`, `count`, and `count2` are in their final states as determined by the loop's execution. Specifically, `done` remains `False`, and `count` and `count2` reflect the final state of the character checks. `i` is equal to `t`. `string` is the user's input. `s` is a list of characters from `string`. `n` is equal to the length of the list `s`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Since the loop has already completed all `n` iterations, the `continue` statement has no effect in this context. Therefore, all variables retain their final states as they were at the end of the loop.
