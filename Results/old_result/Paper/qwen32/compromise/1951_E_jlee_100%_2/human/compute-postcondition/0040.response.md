Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`, `string` is the input string, `n` must be greater than 0, `done` is True, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, and `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values.
