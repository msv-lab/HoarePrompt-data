Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `done` is `False`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `i` is `t + 1`, `string` is the new user's input, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new list `s`, and `x` is the first character of the new `string`. If `n` is 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `s.count(x) == n`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `s.count(x) == n - 1`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `n` is odd and the middle character of `s` is not equal to `x`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `done` is `True` if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains `False`. If `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is less than `count` if the most internal loop or if statement was not broken out of, or `count2` equals `count` if `count` is greater than 1, or `count2` is 0 if `s[j]` equals `x`. If `count` is not greater than 0, `count2` remains 0. `i` is `t + 1`, `string` is the new user's input, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is greater than 0, and `x` is the first character of the new `string`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is `j + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `count` remains `j` if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is not less than 1, `count` remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True and the loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged. If `count > 0`, `count2` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count2 < count`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count2 >= count`, `done` is True if `count` is greater than 1 or `count2` is greater than `count`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count` is not greater than 1 and `count2` is not greater than `count`, `count2` is set to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is `j + 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j`. If `count` is greater than 0, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count2` is set to 0 if `count2` is less than `count`; otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `count` is greater than 0, and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `count2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
