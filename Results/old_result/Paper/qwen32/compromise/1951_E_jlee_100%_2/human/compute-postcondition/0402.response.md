The only variable in the loop head is `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` is greater than 0.

To move to the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

State: **`j` is `j + 2`, `n` is greater than 0**
