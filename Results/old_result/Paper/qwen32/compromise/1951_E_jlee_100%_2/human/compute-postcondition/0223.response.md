Postcondition: **`done` remains `False` if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is set to `True`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j`. `count2` is less than or equal to `count`, and if `count2` was less than `count`, it is updated to `count` if `count` is greater than 1. `i` remains equal to `t`, `string` remains the user's input, `s` remains a list of characters from `string`, and `n` remains greater than 0. `x` remains the first character of `string`. If `count` is greater than 0, `done` is `True` if `count` is greater than 1 or if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to `j`.**
