Postcondition: **`count` is greater than 0, `done` is `True` if `count` is greater than 1 or if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains `False`. `count2` is equal to `count` if `count` is greater than 1, otherwise `count2` is either 0 or greater than `count`. `i` remains equal to `t`, `string` remains the user's input, `s` remains a list of characters from `string`, and `n` remains greater than 0. `x` remains the first character of `string`. `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. If `count` was less than 1 before this condition, `count` is set to `j`. If `count` is greater than 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2 > count`, the loop or condition is also broken.**
