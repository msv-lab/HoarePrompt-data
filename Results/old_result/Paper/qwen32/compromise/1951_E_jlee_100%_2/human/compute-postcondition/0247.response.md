The provided initial state describes a set of conditions and variables within a code context, but it doesn't specify the exact values or the current state of the variables `done`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `count`, `count2`, and `j`. However, the `print('YES')` statement is independent of these conditions and variables. It will execute and print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Here's the reasoning step-by-step:
1. The `print('YES')` statement is a direct output statement.
2. It does not depend on the values of `done`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `count`, `count2`, or `j`.
3. The `print('YES')` statement will execute and print `'YES'` as specified.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **YES**
