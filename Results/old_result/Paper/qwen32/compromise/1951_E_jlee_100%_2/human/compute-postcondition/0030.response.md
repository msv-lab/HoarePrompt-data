Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`, `string` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, and `done` is False. The count of the first character `x` in the list `s` is not equal to `n`. If the count of `x` in `s` is `n - 1`, and `n` is odd with the middle character of `s` (at index `(n - 1) // 2`) not being `x`, then the condition in the if part is met. Otherwise, either `n` is even, or if `n` is odd, the middle element `s[(n - 1) // 2]` is equal to `x`.**
