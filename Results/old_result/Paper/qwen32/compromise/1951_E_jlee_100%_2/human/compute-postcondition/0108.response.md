Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`, `string` is the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `count2` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
