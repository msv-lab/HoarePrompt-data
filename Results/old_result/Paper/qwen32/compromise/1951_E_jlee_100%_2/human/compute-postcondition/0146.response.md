Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`, `string` is the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True and the loop or if statement is broken. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
