Output State: **`done` is `True`; `i` remains equal to `t`; `string` remains the user's input; `s` remains a list of characters from `string`; `n` remains greater than 0; `x` remains the first character of `string`; `count` remains unchanged; `count2` remains unchanged; `j` remains unchanged; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the execution of `break` does not change the values of any variables. The program simply exits the most internal loop or if statement.
