To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the given initial state step by step.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`j` is `j + 1`**: This suggests that `j` is being incremented by 1 at some point. However, the exact value of `j` before this increment is not provided.
2. **`n` is greater than 0**: This indicates that `n` is a positive integer.
3. **`count` remains `j` if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1**:
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j`.
   - Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.
4. **If `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is not less than 1, `count` remains unchanged**:
   - This condition reinforces the previous one, ensuring that `count` is only updated when `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1.
5. **If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True and the loop or if statement is broken**:
   - This implies that if the elements at positions `j` and `n - 1 - j` in the list `s` are not equal, a flag `done` is set to `True`, and some kind of loop or conditional block is exited.
6. **Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged**:
   - If the elements at positions `j` and `n - 1 - j` are equal, `done` remains as it was before.

### Code Execution:
The `print('YES')` statement is executed regardless of the conditions mentioned above. The conditions describe the behavior of variables `j`, `count`, and `done` but do not affect the execution of the `print` statement itself.

### Conclusion:
Since the `print('YES')` statement is not dependent on any of the conditions or variables described in the initial state, it will always print "YES" when executed.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
