The code snippet sets the variable `done` to `True`. This change affects the variable `done`, but does not change the values of any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`, `string` is the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True, and `count2` is 0. The current value of `count` is greater than 0, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is less than `count`.**
