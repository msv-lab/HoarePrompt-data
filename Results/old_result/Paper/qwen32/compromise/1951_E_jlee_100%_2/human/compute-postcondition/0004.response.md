The code snippet calculates the length of the list `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The list `s` is derived from the input string `string`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `string` remain unchanged. The value of `n` will be equal to the number of characters in `string`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`, `string` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`**.
