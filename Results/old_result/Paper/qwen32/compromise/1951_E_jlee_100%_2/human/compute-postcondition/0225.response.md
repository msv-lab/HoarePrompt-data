To determine the output of the `print('YES')` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the conditions and variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`done`**: This variable is set to `False` if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` (indicating symmetry in the string around its center), otherwise it is set to `True`.
2. **`count`**: This variable is set to `j` if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` (the first character of the string) and `count` is less than 1.
3. **`count2`**: This variable is updated to `count` if `count2` is less than `count` and `count` is greater than 1.
4. **`i`**: This variable remains equal to `t` (which is not defined in the given context, but it does not affect the `print` statement).
5. **`string`**: This is the user's input.
6. **`s`**: This is a list of characters from `string`.
7. **`n`**: This is the length of the string `string`.
8. **`x`**: This is the first character of the string `string`.
9. **`j`**: This variable is incremented by 1 in each iteration (though the loop is not explicitly shown in the snippet).

### Analysis:
- The `print('YES')` statement is not conditional on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. It is a standalone print statement.
- This means that regardless of the values of `done`, `count`, `count2`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, or `j`, the print statement will execute and print 'YES'.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will always output 'YES' because it is not dependent on any of the conditions or variables described in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
