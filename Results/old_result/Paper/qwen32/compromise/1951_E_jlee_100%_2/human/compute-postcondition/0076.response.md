Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`, `string` is the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains False, and `count2` is 0. `count` is greater than 0, and `s[j]` is equal to `x`. The current value of `count` remains greater than 0.**
