The `break` statement will terminate the loop or the block of code it is in, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `j`, `n`, `done`, `s[j]`, `s[n - 1 - j]`, `x`, and `count` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `j + 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True, `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` or `done` remains unchanged, if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
