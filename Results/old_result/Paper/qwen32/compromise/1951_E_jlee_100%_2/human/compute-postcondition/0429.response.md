Output State: **`j` is `j + 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True, `count` is less than 1 if it was already less than 1, and `count` is set to `j` if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` was less than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `j`, `n`, `done`, and `count` remain as they were described in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
