The given initial state describes the following:
- `j` is updated to `j + 1`, but the initial value of `j` is not provided.
- `n` is greater than 0, but the exact value of `n` is not provided.
- The `print` statement is `print(string)`, but the variable `string` is not defined in the initial state.

Since the variable `string` is not defined in the initial state, it is not possible to determine its value based on the given information. Therefore, the code will raise a `NameError` because `string` is referenced before it is assigned a value.

However, if we assume that the task is to describe what would be printed if `string` were defined, we would need its value to proceed. Since it is not defined, we cannot provide a specific output.

Given the current information, the output would be an error due to the undefined variable. But strictly adhering to the task format and assuming we need to describe the output based on existing information:

Output: **NameError: name 'string' is not defined**
