Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. Let's analyze why:

The program calculates the number of fireworks visible from each installation separately and adds them together with an additional constant (2). This logic does not account for the overlap in visibility times between fireworks from the two installations.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Counting fireworks from each installation**:
   - `A = m // a + 1` counts the number of fireworks launched by the first installation that are visible within the first `m` minutes.
   - `B = m // b + 1` counts the number of fireworks launched by the second installation that are visible within the first `m` minutes.

2. **Adding the counts**:
   - The program adds `A` and `B` and then adds 2. This addition of 2 is incorrect and does not represent any valid scenario in the problem statement.

3. **Overlap not considered**:
   - The program does not consider the overlap in visibility times between fireworks from the two installations. For example, if a firework from the first installation is launched at time `x` and a firework from the second installation is launched at time `y`, both fireworks could be visible simultaneously if `|x - y| <= m`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and then calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within a period that includes the LCM. We also need to account for the overlap in visibility times.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    def lcm(x, y):
        return x * y // math.gcd(x, y)

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        count_a = (m // a) + 1
        count_b = (m // b) + 1
        count_overlap = (m // lcm_ab) + 1
        max_visible = count_a + count_b - count_overlap
        print(max_visible)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected program calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the first `m` minutes and subtracts the overlap in visibility times to get the correct maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.
