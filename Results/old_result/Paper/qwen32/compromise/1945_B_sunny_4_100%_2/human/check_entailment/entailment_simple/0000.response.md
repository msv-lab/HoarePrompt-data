Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect based on the problem description and the given examples. The logic in the program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time.

The program calculates the number of fireworks from each installation separately (`m // a + 1` and `m // b + 1`) and then adds them together, adding an extra 1 (`+ 2` in the corrected line). However, this approach does not account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations, which can occur when the launch times of fireworks from both installations coincide or are close enough such that their visibility periods overlap.

For example, in the third test case, the fireworks from the first installation are launched at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112], and the fireworks from the second installation are launched at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112]. Both installations launch fireworks at time 56 and 112, and there are other overlapping intervals. The program does not account for these overlaps correctly.

The correct approach involves calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to find the periodicity of overlapping fireworks and then determining the number of fireworks visible at each period. The formula to calculate the maximum number of overlapping fireworks is more complex and involves the inclusion-exclusion principle.

Given the incorrect calculation in the program, the output for some test cases will be incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
