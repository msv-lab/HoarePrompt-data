You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

            for i in tab:
                print(i, end=' ')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: If `k` is 0 after all iterations, the output will be "YES", followed by the length of `tab` and the elements of `tab`. If `k` is not 0, the output will be "NO".
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it determines whether it's possible to reduce `k` to 0 by repeatedly subtracting the minimum of `n // k` and `k` (or the maximum of `n // k` and `k` under certain conditions) from `k`, while also decrementing `n` accordingly. If `k` can be reduced to 0, it outputs "YES", followed by the number of operations performed and the sequence of numbers used in the operations. If `k` cannot be reduced to 0, it outputs "NO".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining the prices at which Alice buys the jewels is flawed, and it does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels in all scenarios.

Here are a few potential issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum and Maximum Prices**:
   The code calculates `Min` and `Max` as `min(n // k, k)` and `max(int(n / k), k)`, respectively. However, these calculations do not necessarily lead to a correct distribution of prices that ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. For example, the logic does not ensure that the prices are decreasing in a way that Alice buys the required number of jewels.

2. **Subtracting `Min * Max` from `n`**:
   The line `n -= Min * Max` does not correctly reflect the coins spent by Alice. Instead, it should be `n -= Min` if `Min` is the number of jewels bought at price `Max`, or `n -= Max` if `Max` is the number of jewels bought at price `Min`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if `n` is very large and `k` is small, the program might not terminate correctly or might not find a valid set of prices.

Here is an example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
10 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
5
2 2 2 2 2
```

**Actual Output:**
The program might not produce the correct output because it does not ensure that Alice buys exactly 5 jewels with 10 coins.

To fix the program, a more systematic approach should be used, such as setting up the prices in a way that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One possible solution is to use a greedy approach where the prices are set in decreasing order, ensuring that Alice buys the required number of jewels.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        if k > n:
            print('NO')
            continue
        prices = []
        remaining_coins = n
        remaining_jewels = k
        for price in range(1, 61):
            if remaining_jewels == 0:
                break
            if remaining_coins < price:
                continue
            num_jewels = min(remaining_jewels, remaining_coins // price)
            prices.append(price)
            remaining_coins -= num_jewels * price
            remaining_jewels -= num_jewels
        if remaining_jewels == 0:
            print('YES')
            print(len(prices))
            print(' '.join(map(str, prices)))
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting up the prices in a decreasing order and checking if the remaining coins and jewels are correctly handled.
