The code snippet increments the variable `rep` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is 0, `k` is either 0 or 3, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing either ['2'] or ['5'], `number` is either 2 or 5, `Min` is 2, `Max` is 5.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is 0, `k` is either 0 or 3, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing either ['2'] or ['5'], `number` is either 2 or 5, `Min` is 2, `Max` is 5.**
