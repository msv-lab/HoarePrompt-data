The code snippet provided increments the variable `rep` by 1. Given the initial state, all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the value of `rep` which was initially 1, becomes 2 after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is either 0 or `-k - 1` or `-2` or `k - 1`, `k` is either 0 or `k - Min`, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing two identical string representations of `number`, `Min` is 1, `Max` is either 0 or `k + Min`, and `number` is either 1 or `k + Min`.**
