The code snippet `tab.append(str(number))` appends the string representation of the variable `number` to the list `tab`. Given the initial state, `number` is 5 (since `Max` is 5, which does not equal `k` initially, and `n * Min` (5 * 1) is less than or equal to `Max` (5), making `k` -4 and `number` 1. However, since `number` is defined based on the condition, and the condition is not met for `k` to be -4 and `number` to be 1, `number` remains 5).

Thus, `tab` will be updated to `['5', '5']`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is 5, `rep` is 1, `tab` is `['5', '5']`, `Min` is 1, `Max` is 5, `k` is 0, `number` is 5**.
