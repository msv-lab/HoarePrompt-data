To determine the output of the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and understand the context in which the `print` statement is executed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is 0.
- `rep` is the number of iterations the loop executed + 1.
- `tab` is a list containing at least one string representation of a number.
- `i` is the next element in `tab` after the last processed element.

### Key Points:
1. **`tab` List**: The list `tab` contains at least one string representation of a number. This means `tab` could be something like `['1', '2', '3']`, `['5']`, `['100']`, etc.
2. **`i` Variable**: The variable `i` is the next element in `tab` after the last processed element. This implies that `i` is an element from the `tab` list. The exact value of `i` depends on the current iteration of the loop and the state of `tab`.

### Loop Context:
- Since `rep` is defined as the number of iterations the loop executed + 1, it suggests that there is a loop that iterates over the elements of `tab`.
- The variable `i` is updated in each iteration to be the next element in `tab`.

### Print Statement:
- The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space, without moving to a new line.

### Output Determination:
- Since `i` is the next element in `tab` after the last processed element, and `tab` contains at least one string representation of a number, the value of `i` will be one of the elements in `tab`.
- Without knowing the exact content of `tab` and the current iteration, we can only describe `i` as the current element being processed in the loop from the `tab` list.

### Conclusion:
Given the information, the value of `i` is the next element in the `tab` list after the last processed element. Since the exact content of `tab` is not provided, the most precise description we can give is that `i` is an element from `tab`.

Output: **i (where i is the current element being processed from the tab list)**
