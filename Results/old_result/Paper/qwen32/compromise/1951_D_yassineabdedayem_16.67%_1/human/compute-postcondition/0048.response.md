To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variables evolve with each iteration. 

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000 (remains unchanged throughout the loop).
- `n` and `k` are both initialized to 0 and do not change within the loop.
- `rep` is the number of iterations the loop executed.
- `tab` is a list containing string representations of numbers calculated in each iteration.
- The loop iterates over each element `i` in `tab` and prints `i` followed by a space.

From the provided output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer:
- After 1 iteration, `tab` contains at least one string representation of a number.
- After 2 iterations, `tab` contains at least two string representations of numbers.
- After 3 iterations, `tab` contains at least three string representations of numbers.

Following this pattern, after all `rep` iterations, `tab` will contain `rep` string representations of numbers, and each element `i` in `tab` will have been printed.

Since the loop iterates over `tab` and prints each element, the final output state will be:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` remains 0.
- `k` remains 0.
- `rep` is the total number of iterations, which is the length of `tab`.
- `tab` contains `rep` string representations of numbers.
- The loop will have printed all elements of `tab` separated by spaces.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is the number of iterations the loop executed (<= 60), `tab` is a list containing `rep` string representations of numbers.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations, the variable `t` retains its initial value within the specified range, `n` and `k` remain unchanged at 0, `rep` reflects the total number of iterations, `tab` contains the string representations of the numbers calculated in each iteration, and all elements of `tab` have been printed with spaces in between.
