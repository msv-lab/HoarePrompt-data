The code calculates the minimum and maximum values between `n // k` and `k`. Given `n` is 10 and `k` is 5, `n // k` equals 2. Therefore, `Min` will be 2 (the minimum of 2 and 5) and `Max` will be 5 (the maximum of 2 and 5).

The other variables (`t`, `rep`, `tab`, `number`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is 10, `k` is 5, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `number` is 0, `Min` is 2, `Max` is 5**.
