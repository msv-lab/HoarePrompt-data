The code snippet recalculates the values of `Min` and `Max` based on the current values of `n` and `k`. Since `Min` and `Max` are recalculated, their values will change according to the new expressions provided in the code. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `rep`, `tab`, `number`) remain unchanged.

Given:
- `Min` is recalculated as `min(n // k, k)`
- `Max` is recalculated as `max(int(n / k), k)`

The new values of `Min` and `Max` will be determined by the current values of `n` and `k`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is `n - Min * Max` and `Min * Max` is a small value ensuring `n >= k` and `n != 0`, the recalculated `Min` and `Max` will reflect these constraints.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is greater than 0, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing either `['2', str(number)]` or `['5', str(number)]`, `number` is either `Min` or `Max`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**

In natural language: The values of `Min` and `Max` have been recalculated to be the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `k`, respectively. All other variables retain their initial values.
