Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is either 0 or `k - Min`, `k` is either 0 or `k - Min`, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is 1, `Max` is either 0 or `k + Min`, and `number` is either 1 or `k + Min`. If `Max` was equal to `k` and `n * Min` was less than or equal to `k`, then `n` becomes 0, `k` becomes 0, `Max` becomes 0, and `number` becomes 1. Otherwise, `n` becomes `k - Min`, `k` becomes `k - Min`, `Max` becomes `k + Min`, and `number` becomes `k + Min`.**
