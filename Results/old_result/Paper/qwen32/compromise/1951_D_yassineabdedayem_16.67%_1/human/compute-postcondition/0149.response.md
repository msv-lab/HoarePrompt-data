The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the value of the variable `i` followed by a space. According to the initial state, the variable `i` is explicitly defined as the string `'5'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `i` is set to the string `'5'`.
2. The `print` statement is instructed to print the value of `i` and to end with a space (`end=' '`).

Therefore, the output will be the string `'5'` followed by a space.

Output: **5 **
