The code snippet `n -= Min * Max` modifies the value of `n` by subtracting the product of `Min` and `Max` from it. Given the initial state, `Min` is 1 and `Max` could be either 0 or `k + Min`. Therefore, the product `Min * Max` can be either 0 or `k + 1`.

If `Max` is 0, then `n` remains unchanged because `n -= 0` does not change the value of `n`. If `Max` is `k + Min`, then `n` is updated to `n - (k + 1)`.

Since `n` is initially either 0 or `k - Min`, and `Min` is 1, we have two cases for the initial value of `n`:
1. If `n` is 0, then after the operation, `n` becomes `0 - (k + 1)` which is `-k - 1` if `Max` is `k + Min`, or it remains `0` if `Max` is `0`.
2. If `n` is `k - Min`, then after the operation, `n` becomes `k - 1 - (k + 1)` which is `-2` if `Max` is `k + Min`, or it remains `k - 1` if `Max` is `0`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is either 0 or `-k - 1` or `-2` or `k - 1`, `k` is either 0 or `k - Min`, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing two identical string representations of `number`, `Min` is 1, `Max` is either 0 or `k + Min`, and `number` is either 1 or `k + Min`.**
