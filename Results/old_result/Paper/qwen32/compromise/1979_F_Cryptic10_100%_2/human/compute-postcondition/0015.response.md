The code snippet `vx.remove(v1)` removes the element `v1` from the set `vx`. Given the initial state, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1` (and `v3` if `v2` ≤ 0). After removing `v1`, `vx` will no longer contain `v1`.

Here’s the updated state:
- `n` must still be greater than 4.
- `vx` is now a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1` (and `v3` if `v2` ≤ 0), but now `v1` is also removed from the set.
- `ops` remains unchanged as it is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2` > 0, otherwise it contains the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`.
- `v1` and `v2` remain the values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1` and `v3` (if `v2` ≤ 0), `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2` > 0, otherwise `ops` contains the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`.**
