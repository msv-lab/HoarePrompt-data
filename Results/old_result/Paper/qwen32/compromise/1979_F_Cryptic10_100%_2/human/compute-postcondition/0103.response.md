The code snippet appends two tuples to the list `ops`. The tuples are `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`. The variables `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` are defined based on the return values of function `q` with specific arguments. The values of `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged, and `vx` has at least one element with `v1` and `v3` removed.

Given the operations, the list `ops` will now include the appended tuples. No changes occur to `vx`, `v1`, `v2`, `v3`, `p1`, or `p2` other than the modification to `ops`.

Output State: **`vx` has at least one element with `v1` and `v3` removed, `v1` and `v2` are the return values of `q(len(vx) - 2)`, `v3` is the first return value of `q(0)`, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged, `ops` includes the additional tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`.**
