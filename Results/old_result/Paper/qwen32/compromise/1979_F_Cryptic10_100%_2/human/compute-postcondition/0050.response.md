Postcondition: **`vx` is a set of integers from 1 to 3 excluding `v1` (and possibly `v3` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0). `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2` is greater than 0, otherwise it is `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`. `p1` contains the initial two integers from `vx` plus any additional integers `v1` appended during loop iterations where `p1[-1] != v2`. `p2` contains any integers `v1` appended during loop iterations where `p1[-1] == v2`. `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(1)`, and `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0.**
