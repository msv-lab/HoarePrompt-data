Postcondition: **`vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input value (inclusive) excluding `v1`; `ops` is an empty list; `p1` contains the initial two integers from `vx` plus any `v1` values that did not match the last element of `p1` at the time of processing; `p2` contains any `v1` values that matched the last element of `p1` at the time of processing; `v1` and `v2` are the return values of `q(len(vx) - 2)`, and `v2` is less than or equal to 0**
