The code snippet `ops += [(v1, v2)]` appends a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. The values of `v1` and `v2` are the return values of `q(len(vx) - 2)`. The initial state specifies that `vx` has one less element (`v1` has been removed), and `ops`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. Additionally, if `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the first return value of `q(0)`. 

After executing the code, the only change is that `ops` now includes the new tuple `(v1, v2)`. The other variables (`vx`, `ops`, `p1`, `p2`, `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` if applicable) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`vx` has one less element, specifically `v1` has been removed; `ops` includes an additional tuple `(v1, v2)`; `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged; `v1` and `v2` are the return values of `q(len(vx) - 2)`; if `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the first return value of `q(0)`**.
