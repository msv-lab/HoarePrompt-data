The code snippet adds a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. The values of `n`, `vx`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged. The only change is that `ops` now contains the new tuple.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to n except `v1`; `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)`; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(n - 2)` with `v2` greater than 0.**
