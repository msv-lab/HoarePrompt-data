Let's break down the print statement and understand the values of the variables and objects involved based on the given initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `p1` contains all `v1` values from `ops` that did not match the last element of `p1` at the time of the operation.
- `p2` contains all `v1` values from `ops` that matched the last element of `p1` at the time of the operation.

### Code Analysis:
```python
print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)
```

1. **`p1[::-1]`**: This reverses the list `p1`. So, if `p1` was `[a, b, c]`, `p1[::-1]` would be `[c, b, a]`.
2. **`p1[::-1] + p2`**: This concatenates the reversed `p1` with `p2`. If `p1[::-1]` is `[c, b, a]` and `p2` is `[d, e]`, the result would be `[c, b, a, d, e]`.
3. **`map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)`**: This converts each element in the concatenated list to a string.
4. **`' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2))`**: This joins all the string elements with a space in between, forming a single string.
5. **`'! %s' % ...`**: This formats the string to include an exclamation mark followed by the joined string.

### Output:
The output will be a string starting with an exclamation mark, followed by the elements of the reversed `p1` list, then the elements of the `p2` list, all separated by spaces.

### Final Output Description:
Output: **! [reversed elements of p1] [elements of p2] (where [reversed elements of p1] are the elements of p1 in reverse order and [elements of p2] are the elements of p2)**

For example, if `p1` was `[1, 2, 3]` and `p2` was `[4, 5]`, the output would be:
Output: **! 3 2 1 4 5**

Since the exact values of `p1` and `p2` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the structure of `p1` and `p2` as given in the initial state.

Output: **! [reversed elements of p1] [elements of p2] (where [reversed elements of p1] are the elements of p1 in reverse order and [elements of p2] are the elements of p2)**
