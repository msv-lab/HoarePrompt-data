Postcondition: **`vx` is a set of integers from 1 to 3 excluding `v1`, `ops` is an empty list, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(1)` with `v2` being greater than 0, `p1` will contain the initial two integers from `vx` plus any additional integers `v1` that were appended to it during the loop iterations where `p1[-1] != v2`, `p2` will contain any integers `v1` that were appended to it during the loop iterations where `p1[-1] == v2`.**
