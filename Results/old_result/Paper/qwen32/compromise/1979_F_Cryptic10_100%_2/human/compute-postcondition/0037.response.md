To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it processes the operations in `ops`. The loop iterates over the reversed list `ops[::-1]`, and for each tuple `(v1, v2)` in `ops`, it checks if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`. If it is, `v1` is appended to `p2`; otherwise, `v1` is appended to `p1`.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
   - `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the set {1, 2, ..., n}.
   - `ops` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers.
   - `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`.
   - `p2` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Processing:**
   - The loop iterates over `ops` in reverse order.
   - For each tuple `(v1, v2)` in `ops[::-1]`:
     - If `p1[-1] == v2`, then `v1` is appended to `p2`.
     - Otherwise, `v1` is appended to `p1`.

The loop will continue until all tuples in `ops` have been processed. The final state of `p1` and `p2` will depend on the specific values in `ops` and the initial values in `p1`.

**Final Output State:**
- `p1` will contain the initial two integers from `vx` plus any additional integers `v1` that were appended to it during the loop iterations where `p1[-1] != v2`.
- `p2` will contain any integers `v1` that were appended to it during the loop iterations where `p1[-1] == v2`.

Since the exact values of `v1` and `v2` in `ops` are not specified, we can only describe the final state in terms of what has been appended to `p1` and `p2` based on the conditions.

Output State: **`p1` contains the initial two integers from `vx` plus any `v1` from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`. `p2` contains any `v1` from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`.**

In simpler terms, `p1` will have all the integers that were not appended to `p2` due to the condition `p1[-1] == v2`, and `p2` will have all the integers that were appended because of this condition.
