The code snippet `v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)` suggests that a function `q` is called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`. The function `q` presumably returns a tuple of two values, which are then assigned to `v1` and `v2`. However, the function `q` is not defined in the provided context, so we cannot determine the specific values of `v1` and `v2` directly. 

Given the initial state, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n`, so `len(vx)` is `n`, and `len(vx) - 2` is `n - 2`. Therefore, the function `q` is called with the argument `n - 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to n; `ops` is an empty list; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(n - 2)`**.
