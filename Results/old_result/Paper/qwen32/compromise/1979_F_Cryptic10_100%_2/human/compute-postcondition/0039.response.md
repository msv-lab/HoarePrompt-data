The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input()))`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not retain any state between iterations. The loop's continuation depends on the value provided by `int(input())`, which is not a variable that can be adjusted based on the previous state.

Since the loop head does not contain any variables that can be directly adjusted to change the state for the next iteration, and since the input value is not part of the state that can be modified programmatically within the loop, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same as the end of the previous iteration in terms of the variables `p1` and `p2`.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged for `p1` and `p2`.

State: **`p1` will contain the initial two integers from `vx` plus any additional integers `v1` that were appended to it during the loop iterations where `p1[-1] != v2`. `p2` will contain any integers `v1` that were appended to it during the loop iterations where `p1[-1] == v2`.**
