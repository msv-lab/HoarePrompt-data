To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `v1` and `v2` in this case. The loop iterates over the reversed `ops` list, so we need to understand how `v1` and `v2` are updated in each iteration.

Given:
- `vx` contains the last two elements that were not removed during the loop iterations.
- `ops` is a list with at least two tuples.
- `v1` is `v1_next`.
- `v2` is `v2_next`.
- `v1` is appended to `p2` if `p1[-1] == v2`, otherwise `v1` is appended to `p1`.

The loop statement is:
```python
for (v1, v2) in ops[::-1]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
The loop iterates over `ops[::-1]`, which means it processes the elements of `ops` in reverse order. At the end of the previous iteration, `v1` and `v2` were the elements of the tuple that was processed. For the next iteration, we need to consider the next tuple in the reversed list.

### Steps to Adjust the State:
1. **Identify the next tuple**: Since we are iterating over `ops[::-1]`, the next tuple to be processed will be the one before the current tuple `(v1, v2)` in the reversed list.
2. **Update `v1` and `v2`**: `v1` and `v2` need to be set to the elements of the next tuple in the reversed list.

### State Adjustment:
Assuming that the current tuple processed in the previous iteration was `(v1, v2)`, the next tuple in the reversed list would be the one that comes before `(v1, v2)` in the reversed `ops` list. Let's denote this next tuple as `(v1_next, v2_next)`.

### New State:
State: **`vx` contains the last two elements that were not removed during the loop iterations; `ops` is a list with at least two tuples; `v1` is `v1_next`; `v2` is `v2_next`**

This state reflects that `v1` and `v2` have been updated to the next tuple in the reversed `ops` list, preparing for the next iteration of the loop.
