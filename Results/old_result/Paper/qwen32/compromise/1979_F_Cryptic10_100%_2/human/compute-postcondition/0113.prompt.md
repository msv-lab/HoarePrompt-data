Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vx` contains the last two elements that were not removed during the loop iterations; `ops` contains all the operations performed during the loop; `p1` is a copy of `vx`; `p2` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
    (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vx` contains the last two elements that were not removed during the loop iterations; `ops` is a list with at least one tuple (v1, v2); if `vx[-1] == v2`, then `p1` remains the same as `vx` and `p2` becomes `[v1]`; otherwise, `p1` becomes `vx` with `v1` appended to it and `p2` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `vx` contains the last two elements that were not removed during the loop iterations; `ops` is a list with at least two tuples; `v1` is `v1_next`; `v2` is `v2_next`; `v1` is appended to `p2` if `p1[-1] == v2`, otherwise `v1` is appended to `p1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `vx` contains the last two elements that were not removed during the loop iterations; `ops` is a list with at least two tuples; `v1` is `v1_next`; `v2` is `v2_next`; `p1` is `p1` with `v1` appended if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, otherwise `p2` is `p2` with `v1` appended.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
