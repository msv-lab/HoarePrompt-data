The code snippet adds a tuple `(v3, 0)` and another tuple `(v1, 0)` to the list `ops`. The values of `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` are derived from function calls to `q` and do not change due to this operation. The list `vx` is modified by removing `v1`, `v3`, and potentially `v2` (though `v2` is not removed in the provided code). The precondition that `vx` has at least 2 elements after removing `v1` and `v3` still holds because the code does not specify the removal of `v2`.

Output State: **`vx` has at least 2 elements after removing `v1` and `v3`; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` before the removal; `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)` and has been removed from `vx`; `ops` includes the additional tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`.**
