Postcondition: **`vx` has at least one element with `v1` removed, `v1` and `v2` are the return values of `q(len(vx) - 2)`, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged. If `v2` is greater than 0, `ops` includes the tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the first return value of `q(0)` and `ops` includes the additional tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`.**
