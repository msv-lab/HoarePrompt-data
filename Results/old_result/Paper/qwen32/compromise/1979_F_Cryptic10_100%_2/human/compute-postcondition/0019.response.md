Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1` and `v3` (if `v2` â‰¤ 0), with `v3` removed, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `[(v1, v2)]` if `v2` > 0, otherwise `ops` contains the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`, `v3` and `_` are the values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `0`, and `ops` now also contains the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`.**

In simpler terms, the `ops` list now includes the additional tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]` regardless of the initial condition of `v2`. All other variables retain their initial states and constraints.
