The code snippet adds two tuples to the list `ops`. Specifically, it appends `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` to `ops`. The values of `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` are determined by the function `q`, and `v3` has already been removed from the set `vx`.

Here is the updated state of the variables after the code execution:

- `vx` remains a set of integers from 1 to 4 excluding `v1` and `v3`.
- `ops` now contains the original list plus the additional tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`.
- `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged as the code snippet does not affect them.
- `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` retain their initial values as they are not reassigned in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`vx` is a set of integers from 1 to 4 excluding `v1` and `v3`; `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2` is greater than 0, otherwise it is `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`, plus the additional tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`; `p1` contains the initial two integers from `vx` plus any additional integers `v1` appended during loop iterations where `p1[-1] != v2`; `p2` contains any integers `v1` appended during loop iterations where `p1[-1] == v2`; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`; `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)` and has been removed from `vx`.**
