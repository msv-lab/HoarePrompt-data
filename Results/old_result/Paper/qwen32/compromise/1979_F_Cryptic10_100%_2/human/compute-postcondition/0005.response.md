The code snippet provided removes the value `v1` from the set `vx`. Given that `v1` is one of the values returned by `q(n - 2)`, and `vx` initially contains all integers from 1 to `n`, the set `vx` will now no longer contain `v1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to n except `v1`; `ops` is an empty list; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(n - 2)`**, and `v1` has been removed from `vx`.
