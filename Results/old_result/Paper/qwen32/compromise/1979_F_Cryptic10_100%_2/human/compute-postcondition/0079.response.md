The only variable in the loop head is `vx`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `vx`. If `len(vx) > 2`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input value (inclusive). To ensure that the loop executes, we need to make sure that the length of `vx` is greater than 2.

State: **`vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input value (inclusive) where the input value is greater than 2; `ops` is an empty list; `p1` contains the initial two integers from `vx` plus any `v1` values that did not match the last element of `p1` at the time of processing; `p2` contains any `v1` values that matched the last element of `p1` at the time of processing.**

This ensures that `len(vx) > 2` and the loop can execute at least once.
