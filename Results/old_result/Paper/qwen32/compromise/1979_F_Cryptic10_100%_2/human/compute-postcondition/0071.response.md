The only objects in the loop head are the variables `v1` and `v2`, and the list `ops`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ops` list. Since `ops` is iterated in reverse order (`ops[::-1]`), for the loop to execute one more time, `ops` must contain at least one more tuple.

At the end of the last iteration, `ops` contains at least one tuple, and `v1` and `v2` are the elements of the last tuple in `ops`. To execute the loop one more time, `ops` must have contained at least two tuples initially, and after the last iteration, `ops` should still have at least one tuple left to process.

Let's denote the state before the last iteration where `ops` had at least two tuples. After the last iteration, `ops` would have one less tuple. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `ops` must now contain exactly one tuple, and `v1` and `v2` should be the elements of that tuple.

State: **`vx` is a set of exactly 2 integers; `ops` is a list of tuples representing operations and must contain exactly one tuple; `v1` and `v2` are the elements of the only tuple in `ops`.**
