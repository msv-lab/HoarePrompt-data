The only objects in the loop head are the tuple variables `v1` and `v2`, and the list `ops`. According to the code, the loop iterates over the reversed `ops` list. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more tuple in `ops` to process.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `vx` contains the last two elements that were not removed, and `ops` is a list with at least one tuple `(v1, v2)`. Since the loop iterates over `ops` in reverse order, the next iteration will process the next tuple in the reversed list.

Let's denote the current state of `ops` as `ops = [(v1_current, v2_current), (v1_next, v2_next), ...]` where `(v1_current, v2_current)` was processed in the last iteration. For the next iteration, the tuple `(v1_next, v2_next)` should be processed.

State: **`vx` contains the last two elements that were not removed during the loop iterations; `ops` is a list with at least two tuples, and the next tuple to be processed is `(v1_next, v2_next)`; `v1` is `v1_next`, `v2` is `v2_next`**.

Since we are only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:
State: **`vx` contains the last two elements that were not removed during the loop iterations; `ops` is a list with at least two tuples; `v1` is `v1_next`, `v2` is `v2_next`**.
