Postcondition: **`vx` has one less element if `v2` is greater than 0, specifically `v1` has been removed. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `vx` has two less elements, specifically `v1` and `v3` have been removed. `ops` includes an additional tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2` is greater than 0, or two additional elements `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0. `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged in both cases. `v1` and `v2` are the return values of `q(len(vx) - 2)`, and if `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the first return value of `q(0)`.**
