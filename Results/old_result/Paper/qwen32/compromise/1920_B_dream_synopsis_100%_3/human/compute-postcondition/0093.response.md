The given code modifies the value of `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`. No other variables are explicitly modified by this line of code.

Let's break down the changes:
- `sums` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i - 1]` minus `2 * a[i + x - 1]`.

All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is at least 0, `x` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, and `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, the current value of `i` satisfies the condition \(i + x - 1 < n\). `sums` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i - 1]` minus `2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
