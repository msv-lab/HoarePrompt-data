Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element `sums`. If `i` is equal to 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `sums` is updated based on whether `i + x - 1` is less than `n`: if true, `sums` becomes `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` becomes `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
