Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that k ≥ 0; `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed (now descending) sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` and, depending on the condition, either the newly appended `sums` or `sums + a[0]`; `i` is `i + 1`; `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `sums` has been updated to be the original `sum1` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
