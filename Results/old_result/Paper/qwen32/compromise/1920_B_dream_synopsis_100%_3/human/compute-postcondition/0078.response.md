To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop progresses and modifies the variables over time. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

### Loop Analysis
- The loop runs for `k + 1` iterations.
- In each iteration, the variable `sums` is updated based on the current index `i`.
- The variable `ans` accumulates these `sums` values.

### Iteration Details
- **Iteration 0 (`i = 0`)**:
  - `sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`
  - `ans.append(sums)`

- **Iteration 1 (`i = 1`)**:
  - If `i + x - 1 < n` (i.e., `x < n`), then `sums = sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`
  - Else, `sums = sums + a[0]`
  - `ans.append(sums)`

- **Iteration 2 (`i = 2`)**:
  - If `i + x - 1 < n` (i.e., `x + 1 < n`), then `sums = sums + a[1] - 2 * a[x + 1]`
  - Else, `sums = sums + a[1]`
  - `ans.append(sums)`

- **General Iteration `i`**:
  - If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`
  - Else, `sums = sums + a[i - 1]`
  - `ans.append(sums)`

### Final Output State
After the loop completes all `k + 1` iterations, the final state will be:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `sum1` remains unchanged.
- `ans` contains `k + 1` elements, each representing the computed `sums` for each iteration.

### Conclusion
The final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, and `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements where each element is the computed `sums` for each iteration of the loop.**

In simpler terms, the final state includes the same values for `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `sum1` as they were initially, and `ans` is a list of `k + 1` computed sums based on the loop logic.
