Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that k ≥ 0; `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed (now descending) sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` and the newly appended `sums`; `i` is incremented by 1; `sums` is recalculated as `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `sums` has been appended to the list `ans`. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and `sums` has been recalculated using the formula `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
