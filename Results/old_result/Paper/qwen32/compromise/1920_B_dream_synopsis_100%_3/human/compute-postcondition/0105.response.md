The given code snippet updates the value of `sums` by adding the element `a[i - 1]` to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, and the condition checks involving `i` and `x` remain unchanged. The only change is in the value of `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`; `ans` is a list containing one element `sums` which is now `sums + a[i - 1]`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
