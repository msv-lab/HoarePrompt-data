Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (after decrementing by 1 from the previous value); `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element `sums`. If `i` is equal to 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `sums` is updated based on whether `i + x - 1` is less than `n`: if true, `sums` becomes `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` becomes `sums + a[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `i` was initially 0, `ans` is a list containing two elements `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]), sums]`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, `ans` is a list containing two elements `[sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1], sums]`. If `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`, `ans` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `sums`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is a list that now includes the new element `sums`. If `i` was initially 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, `sums` is initially `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and then updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`; otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
