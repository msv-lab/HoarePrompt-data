The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Given that `sums` is already an element in `ans`, appending `sums` again means `ans` now contains two identical elements, both equal to `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is at least 0; `x` is the third integer from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `sums`, where `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
