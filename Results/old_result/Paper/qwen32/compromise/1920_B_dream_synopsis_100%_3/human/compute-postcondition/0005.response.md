The code calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `sum1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed (now descending) sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.**
