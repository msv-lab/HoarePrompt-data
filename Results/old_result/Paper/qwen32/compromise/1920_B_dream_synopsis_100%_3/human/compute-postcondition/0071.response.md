The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. No other variables are modified by this line of code. The value of `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is a list that now includes the new element `sums`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
