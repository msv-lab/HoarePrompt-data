To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This represents the number of test cases, but it does not directly affect the current print statement.
- `n` is an integer, representing the number of elements in the list `a`.
- `k` is at least 0, representing the number of iterations or operations performed.
- `x` is an integer, but its role is not specified in the context of the current print statement.
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, meaning the largest element is at the beginning of the list.
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
- `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, where each element is the computed sum for each iteration of a loop.

Given these details, the `print(max(ans))` statement will print the maximum value from the list `ans`.

Since the exact values of the elements in `ans` are not provided, we cannot determine the specific numerical value that will be printed. However, we know that `max(ans)` will return the largest value among the `k + 1` elements in the `ans` list.

Therefore, the output will be described as follows:

Output: **max(ans) (where max(ans) is the maximum value in the list ans)**
