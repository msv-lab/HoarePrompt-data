Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly map the characters from the encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`. The program attempts to map each character in the encoded string to a new character based on the position in a sorted set of characters from `b`, but this does not align with the encoding process described in the problem.

In the encoding process:
- The string `r` is constructed from the distinct characters of the original string `s` in alphabetical order.
- Each character in `s` is replaced by its symmetric character in `r`.

To decode correctly:
- We need to construct the string `r` from the distinct characters of the encoded string `b` in alphabetical order.
- For each character in the encoded string `b`, we need to find its position in `r` and replace it with the symmetric character in `r`.

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
num_test_cases = int(input())
for _ in range(num_test_cases):
    num_chars = int(input())
    b = input()
    print(func_1(b))

def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    # Construct the string r from distinct characters in b, sorted alphabetically
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(b)))
    # Create a mapping from each character in r to its symmetric character
    char_map = {r[i]: r[-i-1] for i in range(len(r))}
    # Decode the string b using the mapping
    s = ''.join(char_map[c] for c in b)
    return s
```

This implementation correctly constructs the string `r` and maps each character in `b` to its symmetric character in `r`, thus decoding the original string `s` correctly.
