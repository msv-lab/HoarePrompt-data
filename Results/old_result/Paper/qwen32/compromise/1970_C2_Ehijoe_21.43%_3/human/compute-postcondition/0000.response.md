The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `t`. The initial state mentions that `nodes` is a dictionary and `start` is an integer, but these are not affected by the provided code.

Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing the neighbors of the node, `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, where n is the total number of nodes in the tree, `n` is the first integer read from the input, and `t` is the second integer read from the input.**
