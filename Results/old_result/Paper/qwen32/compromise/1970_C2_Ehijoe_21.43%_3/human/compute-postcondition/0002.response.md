The code snippet assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `empty`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing the neighbors of the node, `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, where n is the total number of nodes in the tree, `n` is the first integer read from the input, and `t` is the second integer read from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is `True`.**
