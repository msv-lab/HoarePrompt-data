### Reasoning:

The problem involves determining the winner of a game played on a tree structure. The game starts with a stone on a specified node, and players take turns moving the stone to an adjacent inactive node until no valid moves are left. The player who cannot make a move loses. The goal is to determine the winner when both players play optimally.

### Analysis of the Functions:

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: To compute the distances from a given starting node to all other reachable nodes in the tree, excluding paths that revisit the parent node.
- **Implementation**: The function is recursive and traverses the tree, calculating distances by adding 1 to the distances obtained from recursive calls to neighboring nodes (excluding the parent node). If the starting node has no neighbors other than its parent, it returns `[0]`.
- **Output Hints**: Confirms the function's role in calculating distances from the starting node to all other nodes.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: To read the tree structure and starting node from the input, use `func_1` to compute distances, and determine the winner based on the parity of the distances.
- **Implementation**:
  - Reads the number of nodes (`n`), the number of rounds (`t`), and the edges of the tree.
  - Constructs a dictionary (`nodes`) to represent the tree.
  - Identifies and stores leaf nodes in a deque (`leaves`), though this part of the code is not used in the subsequent logic.
  - Reads the starting node for the game.
  - Calls `func_1` to get all distances from the starting node.
  - Checks if there is any distance that is odd. If so, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.
- **Output Hints**: Confirms the function's role in determining the winner based on the parity of the distances.

### Correctness:
- The function `func_1` correctly computes the distances from the starting node to all other nodes in the tree.
- The function `func_2` correctly reads the input, computes the distances using `func_1`, and determines the winner based on the parity of these distances.
- The game's outcome is correctly determined by checking if there is at least one node reachable in an odd number of moves. If so, Ron wins because he can force a win by moving the stone to such a node. If all reachable nodes are an even number of moves away, Hermione wins.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it accurately implements the logic required to determine the game's winner based on the given problem description.

**Correctness: True**
