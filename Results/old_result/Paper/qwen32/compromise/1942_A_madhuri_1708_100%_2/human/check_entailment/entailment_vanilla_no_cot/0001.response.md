Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find an array of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted. Here are the key points:
1. An array is sorted if its elements are in non-decreasing order.
2. Cyclic shifts of an array are rotations of the array.
3. For example, for an array `[1, 2, 3, 3]`, the cyclic shifts are:
   - `[1, 2, 3, 3]` (sorted)
   - `[2, 3, 3, 1]` (not sorted)
   - `[3, 3, 1, 2]` (not sorted)
   - `[3, 1, 2, 3]` (not sorted)
4. We need to find an array where exactly `k` of these cyclic shifts are sorted.
5. If no such array exists, we should output `-1`.

### Program Analysis
The provided program handles the input and determines the output based on the values of `n` and `k`:
1. It reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
3. If `k >= 2`:
   - If `n == k`, it outputs an array of `n` elements where each element is `k`.
   - Otherwise, it outputs `-1`.
4. If `k < 2` (i.e., `k == 1`):
   - It outputs an array of `n` elements where the elements are in increasing order starting from `1` (i.e., `[1, 2, ..., n]`).

### Correctness Evaluation
Let's evaluate the correctness of the program based on the logic provided:
1. **Case `k >= 2`:**
   - If `n == k`, the program outputs an array where all elements are the same (e.g., `[k, k, ..., k]`). All cyclic shifts of this array will be the same and sorted, so there will be `n` sorted cyclic shifts, which is correct when `n == k`.
   - If `n > k`, the program outputs `-1`. This is correct because it's impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `n > k` since having all elements the same results in `n` sorted cyclic shifts, and any other configuration will result in fewer than `k` sorted cyclic shifts.
2. **Case `k == 1`:**
   - The program outputs an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`, which is already sorted. The only sorted cyclic shift is the array itself, so there is exactly `1` sorted cyclic shift, which is correct.

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
