Reasoning:  
The given program attempts to solve the problem based on the conditions provided. Let's break down the logic:

1. **For k >= 2:**
   - If `n == k`, the program outputs an array where all elements are `k`. This array will have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts because all cyclic shifts will be the same and sorted.
   - If `n != k`, the program outputs `-1` because it's impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `k` is less than `n` and greater than 1. This is because if `k` is less than `n`, there will be more than `k` cyclic shifts, and it's not possible to have exactly `k` of them sorted without violating the conditions.

2. **For k < 2:**
   - If `k` is 1, the program outputs an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This array has exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is the array itself. All other cyclic shifts will be unsorted because the array is strictly increasing. This satisfies the condition for `k = 1`.

The given conditions and the logic in the program seem to cover all possible cases correctly. The program handles the edge cases and the constraints provided in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
