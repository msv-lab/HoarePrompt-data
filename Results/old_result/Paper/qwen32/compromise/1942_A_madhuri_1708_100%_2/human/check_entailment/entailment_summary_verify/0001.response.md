### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's revisit the problem description and analyze the logic implemented in the code with respect to the function summary and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:

- **Sorted Array Requirement**: An array is sorted if each element is less than or equal to the next element.
- **Cyclic Shift**: For an array `a` of length `n`, the `x`-th cyclic shift is defined as `a_x, a_{x+1}, ..., a_n, a_1, ..., a_{x-1}`.
- **Objective**: Find an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted. If no such array exists, return `-1`.

#### Provided Program:

```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[j + 1 for j in range(n)])
```

#### Function Summary Recap:

- For `k >= 2`:
  - If `n == k`, print an array with all elements equal to `k`.
  - If `n != k`, print `-1`.
- For `k < 2`:
  - Print an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

#### Analysis:

1. **Case `k >= 2`:**
   - **Subcase `n == k`:**
     - The program outputs an array where all elements are `k`. For example, if `n = 3` and `k = 3`, the output is `[3, 3, 3]`.
     - All cyclic shifts of such an array are identical and sorted because all elements are the same.
     - **Conclusion**: This satisfies the requirement of exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts.
   - **Subcase `n != k`:**
     - The program outputs `-1` because it's impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `k` is not equal to `n` and `k >= 2`.
     - **Conclusion**: This is correct because if `k < n`, there cannot be `k` sorted cyclic shifts without violating the uniqueness required by `k >= 2`.

2. **Case `k < 2`:**
   - The program outputs an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - This array has exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is the array itself.
   - **Conclusion**: This satisfies the requirement of exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `k = 1`.

#### Validation with Example Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1: `n = 2, k = 2`**
  - Output: `[2, 2]`
  - Cyclic shifts: `[2, 2]` and `[2, 2]` (both sorted)
  - **Conclusion**: Correct

- **Test Case 2: `n = 3, k = 1`**
  - Output: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - Cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 3]` (sorted), `[2, 3, 1]`, `[3, 1, 2]` (not sorted)
  - **Conclusion**: Correct

- **Test Case 3: `n = 3, k = 2`**
  - Output: `-1`
  - **Conclusion**: Correct because it's impossible to have exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts with `n = 3`.

#### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly handles all specified cases based on the problem description. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
