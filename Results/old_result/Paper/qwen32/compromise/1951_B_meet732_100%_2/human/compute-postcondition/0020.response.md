Postcondition: **`ind` is a list containing up to 2 indices of cows with ratings greater than `x`, and `c` is the count of such cows (0, 1, or 2). Since `ind` is not an empty list and its length is not equal to 1, the length of `ind` is 2. Additionally, the first element of `ind` is not 0. The current value of `k` is greater than the second element of `ind`.**
