Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes a list `a` that contains multiple test cases. Each test case includes the number of cows `n`, the index `k` of the cow you own, and a list of Cowdeforces ratings for the cows. The function determines and returns a value based on the ratings and indices of the cows. Specifically, it identifies up to two cows with ratings higher than the cow at index `k` and calculates a value that represents a certain relationship between the indices of these cows and the index `k`. The return value depends on the number and positions of these cows with higher ratings.**
