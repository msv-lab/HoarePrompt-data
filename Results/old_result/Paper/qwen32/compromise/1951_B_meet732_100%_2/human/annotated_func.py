#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases. Each test case is represented by two parts: the first part is a list containing two integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n), representing the number of cows and the index of the cow you own, respectively. The second part is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with all a_i's being pairwise different. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a list `a` that contains multiple test cases. Each test case includes the number of cows `n`, the index `k` of the cow you own, and a list of Cowdeforces ratings for the cows. The function determines and returns a value based on the ratings and indices of the cows. Specifically, it identifies up to two cows with ratings higher than the cow at index `k` and calculates a value that represents a certain relationship between the indices of these cows and the index `k`. The return value depends on the number and positions of these cows with higher ratings.
