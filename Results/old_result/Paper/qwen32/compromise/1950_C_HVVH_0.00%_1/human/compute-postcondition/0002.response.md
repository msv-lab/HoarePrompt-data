The only variables in the loop head of the provided for loop are `_` and `n`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable that is not used within the loop body, and `n` controls the number of iterations the loop will execute. Therefore, the state of `t` and the list of time strings do not affect whether the loop can execute; only `n` does.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0. The value of `t` and the list of time strings are irrelevant to the execution of the loop itself.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `n` must be greater than 0**
