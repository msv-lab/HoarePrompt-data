### Reasoning:

Let's evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, the code, and the function summary.

1. **Function Call Error**: 
   - The code attempts to call `func_1(n, k)` within the loop, but `func_1` is not defined in the provided code. This would indeed result in a `NameError`. However, the original assessment suggests that the logic itself is incorrect, so let's focus on the logic first.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` uses a very simplistic approach to determine whether Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels. It only considers two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1` and checks if the sum of the quotients from division operations is at least `k`. This is insufficient and incorrect for many cases.
   - The function summary indicates that the function is supposed to print 'YES' followed by the number of stalls and their prices if it's possible, or 'NO' if it's not possible. However, the function does not properly achieve this. It only considers two stalls and does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if `n` is very large and `k` is small, or vice versa, the program should be able to determine if it's possible to set up the stalls accordingly.
   - The original assessment suggests that the program does not handle these cases correctly, which aligns with the logic provided in `func_1`.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output format is incorrect. The program should print "YES" followed by the number of stalls and their prices if it's possible, or "NO" if it's not possible. The provided function `func_1` does not correctly format the output.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. The logic used in `func_1` is too simplistic and does not properly handle the requirements of the problem. Additionally, the function is not defined in the provided code, which would result in a `NameError`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
