Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels given `n` coins and the constraints provided. However, the logic in the program is flawed and does not correctly address the problem requirements.

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - The program correctly checks if `n == k` and outputs "YES" with a stall price of 1, since Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels if she has `k` coins.
   - The program correctly checks if `n < k` and outputs "NO" since it's impossible for Alice to buy more jewels than she has coins.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program initializes a list `costs` with two values: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It then tries to calculate the number of jewels Alice can buy at these prices, but the logic is incorrect. It calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy at each price and subtracts the total cost from `n`, but it does not properly ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Output**:
   - The program incorrectly outputs "YES" and prints the prices in `costs` if the total number of jewels Alice can buy (`h`) is at least `k`. However, it does not ensure that the number of stalls is at most 60 and that the prices are valid.

The program does not guarantee that the number of stalls is at most 60, nor does it ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels with the given prices. The current logic is too simplistic and does not account for the constraints properly.

**Correctness**: **False**
