The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}). It prints 'YES' followed by 1, 1, 1 if `n` equals `k`. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates a list of costs and checks if the sum of quotients from division operations is at least `k`. If so, it prints '2', 'YES', and the list of costs; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value in any case.
