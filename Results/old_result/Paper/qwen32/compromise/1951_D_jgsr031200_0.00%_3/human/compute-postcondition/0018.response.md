The provided initial state describes the values and conditions of certain variables before the code snippet is executed. Specifically:

- `n` is 0.
- `h` is the sum of the quotients from each division operation performed in a loop.
- `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

The code snippet is simply a `print` statement:

```python
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n`, `h`, or `k` in any way. It directly outputs the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
