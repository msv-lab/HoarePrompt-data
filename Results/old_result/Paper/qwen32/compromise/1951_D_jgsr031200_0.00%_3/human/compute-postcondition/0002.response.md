The given initial state describes that `n` and `k` are positive integers, and they are currently equal to each other. However, the `print` statement in the provided code snippet does not reference either `n` or `k`. Instead, it simply prints the integer `1`.

Since the `print` statement is not dependent on the values of `n` or `k`, the output will be the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
