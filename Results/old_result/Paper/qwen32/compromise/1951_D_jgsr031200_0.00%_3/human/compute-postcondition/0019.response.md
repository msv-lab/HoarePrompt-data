Given the initial state, we have the following information:

- `n` is 0.
- `h` is the sum of the quotients from each division operation performed in a loop.
- `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

However, the key variable for the `print` statement is `costs`, which is not mentioned in the initial state. Since `costs` is not defined or given any specific value in the precondition, we cannot determine its exact value.

Thus, the output of the `print(*costs)` statement depends on the value of `costs`, which is not provided.

Output: **costs (where costs is a list or iterable whose elements will be printed separated by spaces)**
