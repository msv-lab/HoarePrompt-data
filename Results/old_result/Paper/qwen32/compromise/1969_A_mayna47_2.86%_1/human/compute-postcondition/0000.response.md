The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means that the value of `n` will be updated to whatever integer is provided as input, while the other variables (`t` and `p`) will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer; `p` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i, and all p_i are distinct.**
