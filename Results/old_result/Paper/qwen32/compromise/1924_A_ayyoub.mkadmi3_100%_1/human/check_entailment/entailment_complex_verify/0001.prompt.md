You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. The function `func_1` is defined with parameters that do not directly match the problem description; it should take four parameters: t (number of test cases), n (length of the strings to check), k (number of different lowercase English alphabets used), and s (the string to check against). However, based on the given function definition `def func_1(s, k, n):`, we assume s is the string for a single test case, and n and k are as described.
def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
        
    #State: `s1` is the original string `s`, `s2` contains characters from `s` that caused the `alphabet` to reset, and `alphabet` is the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a tuple containing three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, the substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and the string `s2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a string `s` composed of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the length of the processed string is at least `n * k`, a substring of the processed string starting from a specific index, and a string of characters that caused a reset condition.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code and the problem statement step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
- We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the given string `s`.
- If they do not all occur, we need to provide one such string that does not occur as a subsequence.

### Code Analysis:
The code uses a function `func_1` to process the input string `s` and determine if all possible strings of length `n` can be subsequences of `s`. Here's a breakdown of the function:

```python
def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
    r = len(s1) // k
    return (len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)
```

#### Explanation of `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `s1` and `s2` are initialized as empty strings.
   - `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters.

2. **Processing the String `s`**:
   - For each character `i` in `s`, if it is in `alphabet`:
     - If `alphabet` has more than one element, remove `i` from `alphabet`.
     - If `alphabet` has only one element, add `i` to `s2` and reset `alphabet` to include all `k` letters again.
     - Add `i` to `s1`.

3. **Final Check**:
   - Calculate `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - Return a tuple:
     - A boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
     - The substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end.
     - The string `s2`.

#### Main Logic:
- For each test case, the main logic calls `func_1` and checks the returned boolean value.
- If the boolean is `False`, it means not all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`. It then attempts to construct a string that is not a subsequence.
- However, the construction of the non-subsequence string seems flawed. It simply finds the first character not in `s1` and repeats it `n` times, which is not necessarily a correct approach.

### Issues:
- The logic for constructing a non-subsequence string is incorrect. It does not guarantee that the constructed string is not a subsequence of `s`.
- The function `func_1` does not correctly identify if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
