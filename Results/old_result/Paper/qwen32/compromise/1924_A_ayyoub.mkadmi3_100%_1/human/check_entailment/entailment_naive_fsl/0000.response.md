Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's analyze why:

1. **Logic Flaw in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is supposed to check if all possible strings of length `n` can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets as subsequences of `s`. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this requirement.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Subsequences**: The function `func_1` attempts to build a set of characters and remove them once they appear in the string `s`, but it doesn't correctly ensure that all possible combinations of length `n` are checked as subsequences. It also incorrectly handles the resetting of the alphabet set and the construction of `s1` and `s2`.

3. **Output Construction**: When the function determines that not all subsequences are present, it constructs a string that might not be a valid counterexample. Specifically, it tries to construct a string by repeating a character that is not in `s1`, but this does not guarantee that the constructed string is a valid counterexample.

Let's consider a specific test case to demonstrate the issue:

### Test Case
```
1
3 2 6
aababb
```

### Expected Output
```
NO
aaa
```

### Explanation of Expected Output
- All possible strings of length 3 using 'a' and 'b' are: aaa, aab, aba, abb, baa, bab, bba, bbb.
- None of these strings can be formed as a subsequence of "aababb" (e.g., "aaa" cannot be formed).
- Therefore, the output should be "NO" followed by a string that cannot be formed, such as "aaa".

### Actual Output of Provided Program
The provided program will likely not produce the correct output because it does not properly check all possible subsequences and does not correctly construct a counterexample string.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
