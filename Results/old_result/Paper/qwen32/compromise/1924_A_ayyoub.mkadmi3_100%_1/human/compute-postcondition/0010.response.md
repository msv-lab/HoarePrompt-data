Postcondition: **`s` is a string of length `m` (where `m` is at least 1) consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `s1` is an empty string, `i` is in `alphabet`. If the length of `alphabet` is not 1, then `s2` is an empty string and `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets except for `i`. If the length of `alphabet` is 1, then `s2` is the string containing the character `i` and `alphabet` is a set containing only the character `i`.**
