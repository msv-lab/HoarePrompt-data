The code removes the character `i` from the list `alphabet`. This means that `alphabet` no longer contains the character `i`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `m` (where `m` is at least 1) consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the next character in `s`, `alphabet` does not contain `i`.**
