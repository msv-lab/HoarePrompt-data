### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum number \( x \) such that after removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree with \( n \) vertices, each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices. The program uses a combination of tree traversal and binary search to determine this maximum \( x \).

Let's break down the key components of the program and verify if they correctly implement the solution:

1. **Tree Representation**:
   - The `TreeNode` class represents each node in the tree, storing edges, children, subtree size, parent, and additional attributes for counting good components and remaining sizes.
   - The `Tree` class manages the collection of nodes and provides methods to add edges and root the tree.

2. **Tree Traversal**:
   - `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to perform a post-order traversal of the tree to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree.
   - Both functions recursively (or iteratively in the case of `func_1`) aggregate information from child nodes to the parent node.

3. **Component Counting**:
   - `func_3` uses the results from `func_1` to determine if it is possible to have at least \( k \) good components with each component having at least \( x \) vertices.
   - It checks if the number of good components is greater than \( k \) or if it is exactly \( k \) and the remaining size is at least \( x \).

4. **Binary Search**:
   - `func_4` performs a binary search on the possible values of \( x \) to find the maximum valid \( x \).
   - It uses `func_3` to verify if a given \( x \) is feasible.

5. **Main Function**:
   - `func_5` reads input, constructs the tree, roots it, and then calls `func_4` to find and print the maximum \( x \).

### Verification:

- **Tree Construction and Rooting**: The tree is correctly constructed and rooted, ensuring that each node has the correct parent-child relationships and subtree sizes.
- **Traversal and Calculation**: Both `func_1` and `func_2` correctly perform post-order traversals and calculate the necessary attributes for each node.
- **Component Counting and Validation**: `func_3` accurately checks if the conditions for a valid \( x \) are met.
- **Binary Search**: `func_4` efficiently narrows down the possible values of \( x \) using binary search.

The program appears to correctly implement the required logic and handles the constraints specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above reasoning, the program is correct and should produce the expected results for the given problem.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
