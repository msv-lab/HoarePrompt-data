Let's break down the program and verify if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Breakdown:
The task is to determine the maximum number x such that removing exactly k edges from a tree results in all remaining components having at least x vertices.

### Program Explanation:
1. **Tree Representation**:
   - The tree is represented using a class `Tree` which contains vertices. Each vertex has children and additional attributes like `good_components` and `remaining_size`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function performs a postorder traversal of the tree starting from vertex `s`.
   - It calculates the number of good components (components with size >= `x`) and the remaining size for each subtree.
   - It uses a stack to avoid recursion and handles postorder traversal manually.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Similar to `func_1`, but implemented recursively.
   - It also calculates the number of good components and the remaining size for each subtree.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function checks if it's possible to have at least `k` good components with each having at least `x` vertices.
   - It uses `func_1` to get the number of good components and the remaining size of the root.

5. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition in `func_3`.
   - It sets the initial range from 1 to `n` and iteratively narrows down the range based on the result of `func_3`.

6. **Function `func_5`**:
   - This is the main function that reads input, constructs the tree, roots the tree, and calls `func_4` to find the maximum `x`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Tree Construction**: The tree is correctly constructed from the input edges.
- **Postorder Traversal**: Both `func_1` and `func_2` correctly perform postorder traversal to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size.
- **Binary Search**: `func_4` correctly uses binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases like when `k` is 1 or when the tree is a straight line.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It efficiently constructs the tree, performs necessary calculations, and uses binary search to find the maximum `x` as required.

**Correctness: True**
