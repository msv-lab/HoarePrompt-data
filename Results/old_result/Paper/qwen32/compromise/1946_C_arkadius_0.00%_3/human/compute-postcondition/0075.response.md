Postcondition: **`v` is the first element of the popped tuple from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the popped tuple from `stack` and is not empty, `tree` is an instance of a Tree class, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, and `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges. The state of `tree`, `s`, and `x` remains unchanged, and `stack` has one less tuple than before entering the if condition.**
