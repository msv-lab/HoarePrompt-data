The code adds an edge between vertices `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the `tree` object. The values of `n`, `k`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged, but the `tree` object is updated to include the new edge. The precondition that `n` is at least 2 and `1 <= k < n` still holds. The only change is the addition of the edge to the `tree`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is the number of edges to be removed such that `1 <= k < n`, `tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices and includes an additional edge between vertices `u - 1` and `v - 1`, `u` and `v` are the two integers read from the input.**
