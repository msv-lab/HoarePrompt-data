Postcondition: **`v` is a vertex in `tree` and `tree.vertices[v].children` is not empty. If `postorder` is not empty, `stack` has one less tuple than before, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to include the sum of its children's `good_components` and incremented by 1 for each child with a `remaining_size` greater than or equal to `x`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to the sum of its children's `remaining_size` that are less than `x`. `s` and `x` remain unchanged. If `postorder` is empty, `stack` has one more tuple `(v, True)` and as many tuples `(u, False)` as there are children in `tree.vertices[v].children`, and the state of `tree`, `s`, and `x` remains unchanged.**
