Output State: **`v` is the first element of the popped tuple from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the popped tuple from `stack`, `tree` is an instance of a Tree class where `tree.vertices[v].children` is a non-empty list, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, `stack` has one more tuple `(v, True)` and one more tuple `(u, False)` than before.**

In simple terms: The variable `stack` now contains one additional tuple `(u, False)` on top of the existing tuples `(v, True)` and the previously existing elements. All other variables remain unchanged.
