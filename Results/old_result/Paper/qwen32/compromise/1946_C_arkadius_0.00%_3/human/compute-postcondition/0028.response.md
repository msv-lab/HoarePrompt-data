Output State: **`tree` is an instance of a Tree class representing a tree structure with vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v].children` is a non-empty list, `u` is the next element in `tree.vertices[v].children` after the previously processed `u`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of its previous value and `tree.vertices[u].good_components` plus 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
