Postcondition: **`v` is a vertex in `tree` that has at least one child, `postorder` is `True`, `tree` is an instance of a Tree class, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, and `stack` contains the remaining tuples after the last tuple has been popped. Additionally, `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`.**
