Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is the number of edges to be removed such that `1 <= k < n`, `tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices and includes `n-1` additional edges between vertices `u - 1` and `v - 1`, where `u` and `v` are integers read from the input for each iteration, `i` is `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the tree will have `n-1` edges added to it, corresponding to the `n-1` iterations of the loop. Each iteration reads a pair of integers `u` and `v` from the input and adds an edge between vertices `u-1` and `v-1` in the tree. The loop variable `i` will have the value `n-1` at the end of the loop.
