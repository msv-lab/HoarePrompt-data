You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tree is an instance of a Tree class representing a tree structure with vertices, s is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, and x is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges.
def func_1(tree, s, x):
    stack = [(s, False)]
    while stack:
        v, postorder = stack.pop()
        
        if not postorder:
            stack.append((v, True))
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                stack.append((u, False))
        
        if postorder:
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
                if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
                    tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
                else:
                    tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size
        
    #State: `stack` is an empty list, and `tree` has its `good_components` and `remaining_size` fields updated for all vertices.
    return tree.vertices[s].good_components, tree.vertices[s].remaining_size
    #The program returns the `good_components` and `remaining_size` of the vertex `s` in the `tree`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `tree`, which is an instance of a Tree class representing a tree structure with vertices, a parameter `s`, which is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, and a parameter `x`, which is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges. The function returns the `good_components` and `remaining_size` of the vertex `s` in the `tree`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the `good_components` and `remaining_size` of the vertex `s` in the `tree`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
