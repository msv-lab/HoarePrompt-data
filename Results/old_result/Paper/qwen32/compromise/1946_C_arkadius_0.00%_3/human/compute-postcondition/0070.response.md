Output State: **`v` is the first element of the popped tuple from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the popped tuple from `stack`, `tree` is an instance of a Tree class where `tree.vertices[v].children` is a non-empty list, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, `stack` has one more tuple `(v, True)`, one more tuple `(u, False)`, and one additional tuple `(u, False)` than before, `u` is the next child in `tree.vertices[v].children`.**

In simpler terms, the `stack` now has an additional tuple `(u, False)` appended to it, while all other variables retain their previous values and states.
