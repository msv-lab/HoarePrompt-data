Postcondition: **`v` is a vertex in `tree` and `tree.vertices[v].children` is not empty. `postorder` is the second element of the popped tuple from `stack` and is not empty. `tree` is an instance of a Tree class. `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal. `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges. `stack` has one less tuple than before entering the if condition. `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is further incremented by 1. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`. `u` is the next child in `tree.vertices[v].children`.**

In simpler terms: `v` remains a vertex in `tree` with non-empty children. `postorder` is still the second element of the popped tuple from `stack` and is not empty. The `tree` structure is preserved as an instance of the Tree class. `s` and `x` retain their initial meanings. The `stack` has one less tuple than before. The `good_components` of vertex `v` are updated by adding the `good_components` of vertex `u`. If `u`'s `remaining_size` is at least `x`, `v`'s `good_components` are incremented by 1. The `remaining_size` of `v` is updated by adding `u`'s `remaining_size`. `u` is the next child in `v`'s children list.**
