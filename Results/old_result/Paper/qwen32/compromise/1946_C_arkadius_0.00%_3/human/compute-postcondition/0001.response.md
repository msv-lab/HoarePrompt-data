The code snippet creates a new `Tree` object with `n` vertices. This action does not change the values of `n` or `k`, but it introduces a new object `tree`.

Output State: **`n` is the number of vertices in the tree as input, `k` is the number of edges to be removed as input, and `1 <= k < n`; `tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices.**
