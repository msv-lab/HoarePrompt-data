Postcondition: **`v` is the first element of the popped tuple from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the popped tuple from `stack`, `tree` is an instance of a Tree class, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, and `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges. If `postorder` is empty, `stack` has one more tuple `(v, True)` and as many tuples `(u, False)` as there are children in `tree.vertices[v].children` than before. Otherwise, `stack` has one less tuple than before and the state of `tree`, `s`, and `x` remains unchanged.**
