To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it correctly solves the problem as described.

The problem requires distributing the bets in such a way that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. The provided program uses a strategy based on the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers to determine the bets.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:
1. The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers.
2. It then divides the LCM by each multiplier to get a set of values.
3. The program subtracts the sum of these values from the LCM.
4. If the result is positive, it prints these values as the bets; otherwise, it prints -1.

Let's analyze if this approach guarantees a correct solution:

- The LCM of the multipliers ensures that the product of each multiplier and the corresponding bet will be a multiple of the LCM.
- By dividing the LCM by each multiplier, the program ensures that the product of the multiplier and the corresponding bet will equal the LCM.
- The sum of these bets is subtracted from the LCM to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

However, there is a flaw in the logic:
- The program does not guarantee that the total bet will be strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome. The subtraction of the sum of the bets from the LCM does not ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome. It only ensures that the total bet is less than the LCM, which is not sufficient.

For example, if the multipliers are [3, 2, 7], the LCM is 42. The bets calculated by the program will be [14, 21, 6], and the total bet is 41. However, the amount received for the third outcome is 7 * 6 = 42, which is not strictly greater than 41.

Therefore, the program does not always provide a correct solution.

Correctness: **False**
