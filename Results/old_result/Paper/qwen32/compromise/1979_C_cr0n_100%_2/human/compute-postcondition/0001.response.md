The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `vals`. The variable `N` is not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`N` is the integer provided by the input, `vals` is a list of integers representing the multipliers for each outcome (2 <= k_i <= 20 for each k_i in vals) where `vals` has been updated to contain the integers from the input.**
