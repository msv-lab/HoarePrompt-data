To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's analyze the loop behavior:

The loop is defined as:
```python
while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
    j += 1
```

This loop increments `j` as long as `j` is less than `m` and the character at position `j` in string `b` is not equal to the character at position `i` in string `a`.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- After 1 iteration, `j` is 1, indicating `b[0] != a[0]`.
- After 2 iterations, `j` is 2, indicating `b[1] != a[0]`.
- After 3 iterations, `j` is 3, indicating `b[2] != a[0]`.

The loop will continue to increment `j` until one of two conditions is met:
1. `j` reaches `m`, meaning the loop exits because there are no more characters in `b` to compare.
2. `b[j] == a[i]`, meaning the loop exits because a match is found.

Since the loop increments `j` until it either finds a match or reaches the end of `b`, the final state of `j` will be the smallest index where `b[j] == a[i]` or `m` if no such index exists.

Given the initial state `i = 0`, the loop will be comparing `a[0]` with characters in `b` until a match is found or the end of `b` is reached.

Therefore, the final output state will be:
- `j` will be the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[0]` or `m` if no such index exists.
- `k` will be 1 if `j < m` (i.e., a match was found), otherwise `k` will be 0.
- `i` will remain 0 as it is not modified inside the loop.

Let's express this in the required format:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is the string read from the input; `b` is the new binary string of length m read from the input; `k` is 1 if `j` was less than `m` and a match was found, otherwise `k` is 0; `j` is the smallest index such that `b[j] == a[0]` or `m` if no such index exists; `i` is 0.**

In simpler terms, the loop will continue to increment `j` until it either finds a match with `a[0]` or reaches the end of `b`. The variable `k` will indicate whether a match was found, and `j` will be the index where the match occurred or the length of `b` if no match was found. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 0.
