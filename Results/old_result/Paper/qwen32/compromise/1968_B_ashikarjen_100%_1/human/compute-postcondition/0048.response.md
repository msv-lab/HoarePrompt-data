To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the context and the values of the variables involved in the print statement.

### Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (This variable is not used in the provided print statement, so it doesn't affect the output).
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5.
- `a` is the string read from the input.
- `b` is the new binary string of length `m` read from the input.
- `k` is the number of characters from `a` that were found in `b` in the specified order.
- `j` is the position in `b` after the last match or the position where the search stopped if a match was not found.

### Print Statement:
```
print(k)
```

### Explanation:
The variable `k` represents the number of characters from the string `a` that were found in the string `b` in the specified order. This implies that `k` is the length of the longest subsequence of `a` that can be found in `b` in the same order.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `k`. However, we can describe the value of `k` based on the given information.

### Output:
Output: **k (where k is the number of characters from `a` that were found in `b` in the specified order)**
