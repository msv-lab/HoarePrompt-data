### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of islands Everule can visit if Dominater optimally destroys up to `k` bridges in a fully connected graph of `n` islands.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Initial State**: Initially, all islands are connected, meaning Everule can visit all `n` islands.
2. **Dominater's Action**: Dominater can destroy up to `k` bridges.
3. **Objective**: Minimize the number of islands Everule can visit.

#### Analysis:
- **Case 1: `k >= n - 1`**
  - If Dominater destroys `n-1` or more bridges, it's possible to disconnect island 1 from all other islands. This is because a fully connected graph with `n` nodes requires `n-1` edges to keep the graph connected. By destroying `n-1` or more bridges, Dominater can ensure that island 1 is isolated, leaving Everule with only island 1 to visit.
  
- **Case 2: `k < n - 1`**
  - If Dominater destroys fewer than `n-1` bridges, it's impossible to isolate island 1 completely. Therefore, Everule can still reach at least `n-1` islands (since one bridge to each other island can still exist).

#### Verification with Provided Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1**: `n=2`, `k=0`
  - No bridges destroyed, Everule can visit both islands.
  - **Output**: `2`
- **Test Case 2**: `n=2`, `k=1`
  - One bridge destroyed, Everule can only visit island 1.
  - **Output**: `1`
- **Test Case 3**: `n=4`, `k=1`
  - One bridge destroyed, but Everule can still visit all islands.
  - **Output**: `4`
- **Test Case 4**: `n=5`, `k=10`
  - More than enough bridges destroyed to isolate island 1.
  - **Output**: `1`
- **Test Case 5**: `n=5`, `k=3`
  - Not enough bridges destroyed to isolate island 1.
  - **Output**: `5`
- **Test Case 6**: `n=4`, `k=4`
  - Enough bridges destroyed to isolate island 1.
  - **Output**: `1`

The program's logic correctly handles both cases as described above.
