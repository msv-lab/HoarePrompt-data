Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit if Dominater optimally destroys up to `k` bridges. The key insight is that Dominater can disconnect island 1 from the rest of the islands by destroying `n-1` bridges (one bridge to each of the other `n-1` islands). 

If `k >= n-1`, Dominater can disconnect island 1 from all other islands, leaving Everule to only visit island 1. Hence, the output should be `1`.

If `k < n-1`, Dominater cannot disconnect island 1 from all other islands, so Everule can still visit at least `n-1` other islands in addition to island 1, making the output `n`.

The provided program correctly implements this logic. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and prints `1` if `k >= n-1` and `n-1` otherwise. This matches the optimal strategy described above.

Correctness: **True**
