Precondition: **n is a positive integer representing the number of rows, m is a positive integer representing the number of columns such that m >= 3, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, d is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m, rows is a 2D list of integers with dimensions n x m where each element a_{i, j} satisfies 0 <= a_{i, j} <= 10^6, a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 for all i.**
