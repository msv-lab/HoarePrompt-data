To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
```

The loop will execute if the second element of the tuple `e` (which is `heappop(min_heap)[1]`) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `row[0]` is 1
- `row[1]` is `e[0] + 1`
- `row[2]` is `e[0] + row[2] + 1`
- `row[3]` and beyond remain unchanged
- `min_heap` contains `e` and `(e[0] + 1, 1)`
- `i` is 2
- `d` is -1

First, we need to determine the value of `i - (d + 2)`:
- `i` is 2
- `d` is -1
- Therefore, `i - (d + 2)` is `2 - (-1 + 2)` which simplifies to `2 - 1` or `1`.

Now, we need to ensure that the second element of the tuple `e` that is popped from `min_heap` is less than or equal to `1`.

The `min_heap` contains two elements:
1. `e`
2. `(e[0] + 1, 1)`

Since `heappop` always pops the smallest element from the heap, we need to check the second element of each tuple in the heap:
- The second element of `e` is not specified, but we can denote it as `e[1]`.
- The second element of `(e[0] + 1, 1)` is `1`.

For the loop to execute, `heappop(min_heap)[1]` must be less than or equal to `1`. Since `(e[0] + 1, 1)` is in the heap and its second element is `1`, `heappop(min_heap)[1]` will be `1` if `(e[0] + 1, 1)` is the smallest element or `e[1]` if `e[1]` is smaller than `1`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `e[1]` is less than or equal to `1`. Since `(e[0] + 1, 1)` is already in the heap with a second element of `1`, the condition will be satisfied if `e[1]` is `1` or less.

Therefore, no specific adjustment is needed for `e[1]` because `(e[0] + 1, 1)` will ensure that the loop condition is met.

The state remains the same:
State: **`row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` is `e[0] + 1`, `row[2]` is `e[0] + row[2] + 1`, `row[3]` and beyond remain unchanged, `min_heap` contains `e` and `(e[0] + 1, 1)`, `i` is 2, `d` is -1**
