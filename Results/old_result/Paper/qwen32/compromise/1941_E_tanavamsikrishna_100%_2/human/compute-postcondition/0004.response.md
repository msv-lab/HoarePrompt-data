To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which includes the variable `i` and the expression `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Head Analysis**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. This means the loop will execute if `len(costs) - (k - 1)` is greater than 0.

2. **Dependencies**: 
   - `len(costs)` depends on the number of rows in `rows` because `costs` is a list of values returned by `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`.
   - `k` is an input integer.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - To ensure the loop executes, `len(costs)` must be greater than or equal to `k`.
   - This implies that the number of rows in `rows` must be at least `k` because `len(costs)` is equal to the number of rows in `rows`.

4. **Adjustments**:
   - We need to ensure that `rows` has at least `k` rows.
   - The initial value of `i` should be 0 to start the loop from the beginning.

Given this analysis, the adjusted state should ensure that `rows` has at least `k` rows and `i` is initialized to 0.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m` where each element `a_{i, j}` is an integer input from the user, and `a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0` for all `i`; `rows` must have at least `k` rows; `costs` is a list of values returned by `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`; `total_costs` is an empty list; `i` is 0**
