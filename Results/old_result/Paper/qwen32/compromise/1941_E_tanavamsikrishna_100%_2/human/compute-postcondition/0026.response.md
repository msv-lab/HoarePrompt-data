To ensure the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the objects mentioned in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
```

This means the loop will continue to execute as long as the second element of the tuple `e` (which is the result of `heappop(min_heap)`) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `row[0]` is 1
- `row[1]` is 0
- `row[2]` is `e[0] + row[2] + 1`
- `row[3]` and beyond remain unchanged
- `min_heap` contains the element `(1, 0)` and the element `(row[i], i)`
- `i` is 1
- `d` is -1

Let's break down the conditions:
1. `e` is the result of `heappop(min_heap)`, so `e` will be `(1, 0)` in the first pop and then `(row[i], i)` in subsequent pops.
2. The condition for the loop to continue is `e[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.

Let's calculate the right-hand side of the inequality:
- `i` is 1
- `d` is -1
- So, `i - (d + 2)` is `1 - (-1 + 2)` which simplifies to `1 - 1` which is `0`.

For the loop to execute again, `e[1]` must be less than or equal to `0`.

Since `min_heap` contains `(1, 0)` and `(row[i], i)`, and `i` is 1, the second element in the heap is `(row[1], 1)` which is `(0, 1)`.

Now, after popping `(1, 0)` from the heap, the next element to be popped will be `(0, 1)`. Here, `e[1]` will be `1`, which is not less than or equal to `0`. Therefore, we need to adjust the heap to ensure that the next element popped has `e[1]` less than or equal to `0`.

To make sure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the heap so that the next element popped has `e[1]` less than or equal to `0`. We can adjust the heap to contain `(1, -1)` instead of `(row[i], i)` which is `(0, 1)`.

State: **`row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` is 0, `row[2]` is `e[0] + row[2] + 1`, `row[3]` and beyond remain unchanged, `min_heap` contains the element `(1, 0)` and the element `(1, -1)`, `i` is 1, `d` is -1**
