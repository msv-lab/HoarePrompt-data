The code snippet `heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))` pushes a tuple `(row[i], i)` into the `min_heap`. Given the initial state, `row[1]` is `e[0] + 1` and `i` is `1`. Therefore, the tuple `(e[0] + 1, 1)` is pushed into `min_heap`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` is `e[0] + 1`, `row[2]` is `e[0] + row[2] + 1`, `row[3]` and beyond remain unchanged, `min_heap` contains `e` and `(e[0] + 1, 1)`, `i` is 1, `d` is -1.**

In natural language, the `min_heap` now includes the additional element `(e[0] + 1, 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
