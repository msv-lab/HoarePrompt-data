The code snippet `total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))` takes a slice of the `costs` list from index `i` to `i + k`, calculates the sum of this slice, and appends the result to the `total_costs` list. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs` is computed and added to `total_costs`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m` where each element `a_{i, j}` is an integer input from the user, and `a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0` for all `i`; `rows` must have at least `k` rows; `costs` is a list of values returned by `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`; `i` is 0.**
