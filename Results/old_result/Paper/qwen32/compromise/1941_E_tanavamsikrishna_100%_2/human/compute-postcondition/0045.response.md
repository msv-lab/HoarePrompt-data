Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `row`, which is a list of non-negative integers, and `d`, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= len(row). The function updates the last element of `row` based on the smallest element `e` from `min_heap` at each step and returns the updated last element of `row`.**
