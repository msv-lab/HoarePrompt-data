To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze the problem description, the code, and the function summaries. Let's break down the code and see if it correctly implements the required solution.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows in a grid representing a river, where:
- Each row has `m` columns.
- The first and last columns of each row have a depth of 0.
- Supports must be installed in the first and last columns of each row.
- The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
- The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.

### Code Analysis
The provided code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(row, d)`: This function calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the input, calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`, and then finds the minimum total cost for any `k` consecutive rows.

#### Function `func_1(row, d)`
This function initializes the first `d` elements of the row and uses a heap to keep track of the minimum costs. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how `func_1` works:
- It sets `row[0]` to 1 (cost of the first support).
- It initializes the first `d` elements of the row by adding 2 to each element (since the first element is already 1).
- It creates a min-heap with the first `d` elements.
- For each subsequent element in the row, it pops elements from the heap until it finds a valid support within the distance `d`.
- It updates the current element's cost and pushes the new cost into the heap.

#### Function `func_2()`
This function reads the input values, calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`, and then computes the sum of costs for every possible group of `k` consecutive rows. Finally, it prints the minimum sum of these costs.

### Issues with `func_1`
The main issue with `func_1` is that it does not correctly handle the constraints of the problem:
- The function does not ensure that a support is always installed at the last column (`row[m-1]`).
- The heap logic and cost calculation might not correctly account for the distance constraint `d`.

### Verification with Example
Let's verify the code with the provided example:
**Input:**
```
1
3 11 1 4
0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0
0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0
0 1 2 3 5 5 5 5 5 2 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

The correct cost for the second row is indeed 4, as the supports can be placed at columns 1, 6, and 11.

### Conclusion
Given the issues with `func_1` and the lack of a clear and correct implementation of the cost calculation logic, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The program does not correctly handle the problem constraints and may produce incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
