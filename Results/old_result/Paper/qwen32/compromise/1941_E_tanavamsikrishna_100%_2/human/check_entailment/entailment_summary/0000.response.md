### Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to verify if it correctly implements the problem requirements as described. Let's break down the problem and the provided code:

1. **Problem Requirements:**
   - We need to build `k` bridges over consecutive rows of a grid.
   - Each row must have supports installed at the first and last column (depth 0).
   - Supports can be installed at other columns, with the cost being `a_{i,j} + 1`.
   - The distance between any two consecutive supports in a row must not exceed `d`.
   - We need to minimize the total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - **Function `func_1(row, d)`**:
     - This function modifies the row to calculate the minimum cost of placing supports such that the distance between any two consecutive supports does not exceed `d`.
     - It starts by setting the first element to 1 and incrementing the next `d-1` elements by 2.
     - It then uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost up to a certain point, ensuring that the distance constraint is respected.
     - Finally, it returns the cost for the entire row.
   - **Function `func_2()`**:
     - This function reads the input parameters (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`) and the grid (`rows`).
     - It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
     - It then computes the sum of costs for every possible group of `k` consecutive rows.
     - It prints the minimum sum of these costs.

3. **Verification:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the minimum cost for placing supports in a single row while respecting the distance constraint.
   - The function `func_2` correctly computes the total cost for every possible group of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum among them.

Given the problem constraints and the provided code, the implementation appears to correctly solve the problem. The use of a min-heap in `func_1` ensures that the distance constraint is respected efficiently, and the calculation of costs and their summation in `func_2` follows the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the problem requirements and should produce the correct output for the given problem constraints.

**Correctness: True**
