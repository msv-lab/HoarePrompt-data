### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to determine the winner of the game based on the number of piles and their respective stone counts. However, the logic implemented in the function `func_1` does not correctly determine the winner of the Nim-like game described.

Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of piles `N` and then attempts to create a set of the stones in each pile. However, creating a set removes duplicate pile sizes, which can change the game dynamics. For example, if there are 3 piles with 1 stone each, the set will only contain one element (1), which incorrectly simplifies the game state.

2. **Game Logic**:
   - The program checks the length of the set of pile sizes:
     - If there's only one unique pile size, Alice wins. This is correct because all piles can be emptied in one move.
     - If there are exactly two unique pile sizes, Bob wins. This is incorrect. The outcome depends on the specific sizes of the piles, not just the count of unique sizes.
     - For more than two unique pile sizes, the program counts consecutive differences of 1 and determines the winner based on whether this count is odd or even. This logic is flawed and does not correctly model the game's mechanics.

3. **Incorrect Assumptions**:
   - The program assumes that the game's outcome can be determined solely by the sorted unique pile sizes and their consecutive differences, which is not accurate for the described game.

### Correctness:

Given the above issues, the program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the provided problem description and example cases.

**Correctness: False**
