The code snippet `nums.insert(0, 0)` inserts the integer `0` at the beginning of the list `nums`. This means that the length of `nums` will increase by 1, and all the original elements in `nums` will be shifted one position to the right. The other variables `t` and `N` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from input; `nums` is a list of integers, sorted in ascending order starting from 0, that were originally represented as strings in the input set, and the length of `nums` is not equal to 1 or 2.**
