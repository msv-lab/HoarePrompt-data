The code snippet converts each string in the set `nums` to an integer, sorts the resulting integers, and reassigns the sorted list back to `nums`. The variables `t` and `N` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from input; `nums` is a list of integers, sorted in ascending order, that were originally represented as strings in the input set.**
