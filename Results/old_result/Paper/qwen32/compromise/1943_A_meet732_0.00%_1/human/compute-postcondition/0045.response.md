The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable that iterates over the list `a`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be updated to the next element in the list `a`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4
- `n` is the input integer
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element
- `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements where the element at index `i` is 2 and all other elements are 0
- `i` is the next element in the list `a`

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has already taken the value of the current element in `a`. To start the next iteration, `i` needs to be updated to the next element in the list `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `t` remains the same
- `n` remains the same
- `a` remains the same
- `cntl` remains the same
- `i` is updated to the next element in the list `a`

Since we are not given the specific current position of `i` in the list `a`, we can represent the state as:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element, `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements where the element at index `i` is 2 and all other elements are 0, `i` is the next element in the list `a`**.

However, to be more specific, if `i` was the `k`-th element in the list `a` during the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `i` will be the `(k+1)`-th element in the list `a`. Since we don't have the exact value of `k`, we can simply say `i` is updated to the next element in the list `a`.

So the final state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element, `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements where the element at index `i` is 2 and all other elements are 0, `i` is updated to the next element in the list `a`**.
