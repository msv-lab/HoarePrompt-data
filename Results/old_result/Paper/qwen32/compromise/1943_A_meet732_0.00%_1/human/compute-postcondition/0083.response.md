Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `cntl[i]` which is 3, `i` is the next element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The value at `cntl[i]` was originally 2, and after executing `cntl[i] += 1`, it becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
