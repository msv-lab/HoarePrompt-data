The `break` statement in the given code snippet will terminate the most internal loop or if statement it is placed within. However, it does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `cntl`, `j`, or `c`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `cntl` will be such that `cntl[i]` is equal to the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `j` is incremented by 1, `c` is decreased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
