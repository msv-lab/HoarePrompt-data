Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 1, `cntl` will be such that `cntl[i]` is equal to the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then `c` is the minimum value between 2 and `cntl[0] - 1`. Additionally, if `c` is False or `j` is equal to `n`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `cntl[j]` is not less than 2, the values of `n`, `cntl`, and `c` remain unchanged.**
