To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to consider the behavior of the loop based on the provided initial state and the observed output states after the first few iterations.

The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `a` and increments the corresponding element `cntl[i]` by 1. This means that after the loop has finished executing, each element `cntl[i]` will represent the number of times `i` appears in the list `a`.

Given that the loop iterates over all elements in `a`, the final state of `cntl` will reflect the frequency of each element in `a`.

**Output State:** `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements, where each element at index `i` is the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`.

In simpler terms, the final output state is that `cntl` will have the counts of each integer from the list `a` at their respective indices.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements, where each element at index `i` is the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`.**
