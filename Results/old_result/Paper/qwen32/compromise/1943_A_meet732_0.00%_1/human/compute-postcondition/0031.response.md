To determine what will be printed by the `print(j)` statement, we need to understand the context and the state of the variable `j` before the print statement is executed.

From the initial state provided:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer that must be at least 1.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements, where each element at index `i` is the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`. Additionally, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.
- `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `c` is decremented by 1 from its previous value.

However, the initial state does not provide an explicit initial value for `j`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `j` without additional information about its initial value and how many times it has been incremented before the print statement.

Given the information, we can only describe the value of `j` in terms of its state relative to its previous value. Specifically, `j` will be one more than its value at the previous point in the code.

Output: **j (where j is incremented by 1 from its previous value)**
