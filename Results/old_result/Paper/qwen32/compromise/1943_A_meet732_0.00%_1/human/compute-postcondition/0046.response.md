The code increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1. Given that `cntl[i]` was initially 2, it will now be 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element, `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements where the element at index `i` is now 3 and all other elements are 0, `i` is updated to the next element in the list `a`**.
