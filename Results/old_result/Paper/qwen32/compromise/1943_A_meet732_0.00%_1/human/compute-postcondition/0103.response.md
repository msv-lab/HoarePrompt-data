The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop iterates from 1 to `n` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the number of times `i` appears in the list `a`. The first element of `cntl` (cntl[0]) is not equal to 0; `c` is either -1, 0, or 1; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is 3. If `cntl[j] < 2`, then `c` is set to -1 or `j` equals `n`, in which case the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state of `cntl`, `c`, `n`, and `j` remains unchanged.**
