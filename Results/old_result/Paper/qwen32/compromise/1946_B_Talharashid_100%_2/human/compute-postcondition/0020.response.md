Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements; `ele` is the next element in the list `l`; `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.**

Natural Language: The variable `maxi` has been updated to hold the maximum value between `c` and its previous value. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `ele`) remain unchanged.
