The only object in the loop head is the variable `ele`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If there are more elements in the list `l`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `ele` is the current element being processed from the list `l`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in the list `l` to be assigned to `ele`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the next element in the list `l` after the current one. If `ele` < 0 and `c` <= abs(`ele`), then `c` is set to 0 and `maxi` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `c`. Otherwise, `c` is increased by `ele` and `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between `c` and its previous value.**

Note: The states of `c` and `maxi` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
