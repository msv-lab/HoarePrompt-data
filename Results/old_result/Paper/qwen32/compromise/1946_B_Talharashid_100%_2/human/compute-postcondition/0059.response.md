The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `l`. This means the previous value of `l` is overwritten by the new list of integers obtained from the input.

The other variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `maxi`, and `i` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is 0 or the sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative numbers, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`, `i` is `len(l)`**
