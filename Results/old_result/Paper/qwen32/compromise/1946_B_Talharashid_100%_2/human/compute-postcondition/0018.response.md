Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0 and `maxi` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `c` is set to `ele` and `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.**
