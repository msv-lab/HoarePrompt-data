The value of `maxi` is explicitly set to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `c`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is `len(l)`**.
