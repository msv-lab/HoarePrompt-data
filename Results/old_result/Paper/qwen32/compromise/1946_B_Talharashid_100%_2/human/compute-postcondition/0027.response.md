To determine what will be printed, let's break down the components of the print statement based on the provided initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. However, `t` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this calculation.
- `n` is an integer, but its specific value is not provided.
- `k` is an integer, but its specific value is not provided.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `c` is either 0 or the sum of the last contiguous non-negative numbers in `l`.
- `maxi` is the maximum of its previous value and `c`.

The print statement is:
```python
print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)
```

Let's break down the expression inside the `print` function:
1. `2 ** k` computes 2 raised to the power of `k`.
2. `2 ** k * maxi` multiplies the result by `maxi`.
3. `2 ** k * maxi - maxi` subtracts `maxi` from the previous result.
4. `sum(l)` computes the sum of all elements in the list `l`.
5. `2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)` adds the sum of the list `l` to the previous result.
6. The final result is taken modulo `1000000007`.

Given that we don't have the specific values of `k`, `l`, and the history of `maxi`, we can describe the output in terms of these variables:

- `maxi` is the maximum value encountered between 0 and the sum of the last contiguous non-negative numbers in `l`.
- `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

Output: **(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007 (where maxi is the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last contiguous non-negative numbers in l, and sum(l) is the sum of all elements in the list l)**
