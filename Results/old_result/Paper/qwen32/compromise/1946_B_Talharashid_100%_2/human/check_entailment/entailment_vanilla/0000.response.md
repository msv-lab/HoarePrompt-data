Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding:
1. **Objective**: Maximize the sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations.
2. **Operation Description**: In each operation, a contiguous subarray can be selected, and its sum can be inserted anywhere in the array.
3. **Constraints**: 
   - Number of test cases, `t`: up to 10^4.
   - Length of the array, `n`: up to 2 * 10^5.
   - Number of operations, `k`: up to 2 * 10^5.
   - Array elements, `a_i`: range from -10^9 to 10^9.
4. **Output**: For each test case, output the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Analysis of the Program:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by first finding the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm and then using this maximum subarray sum to compute the final result.

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads the list of integers `l`.

2. **Finding Maximum Subarray Sum**:
   - It initializes `c` (current sum) and `maxi` (maximum sum found) to 0.
   - It iterates through each element in the list `l`:
     - If the element is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of the element, it updates `maxi` and resets `c`.
     - Otherwise, it adds the element to `c` and updates `maxi`.
   - After the loop, it performs a final comparison to ensure `maxi` holds the maximum subarray sum.

3. **Computing the Result**:
   - The result is computed as `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.
   - This formula assumes that the maximum subarray sum `maxi` can be repeatedly added to the array, and the total contribution is `2^k * maxi - maxi`.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Formula**:
   - The formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` is incorrect. The term `2 ** k * maxi - maxi` does not correctly represent the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.
   - The term `2 ** k * maxi` suggests that the maximum subarray sum is added `2^k` times, which is not the correct strategy.
   - The correct approach would involve adding the maximum subarray sum as many times as possible, but the formula used here does not account for this correctly.

2. **Handling Negative Arrays**:
   - The program does not handle cases where all elements are negative correctly. The maximum subarray sum in such cases should be 0 (an empty subarray), but the program might not handle this scenario correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the formula used to compute the result, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
