Let's analyze the program to determine if it correctly calculates the maximum profit Bob can obtain from selling the buns under the given promotion rules.

### Explanation:

1. **Base Case: b <= a**
   - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it's better not to use the promotion at all. Therefore, Bob should sell all `n` buns at the usual price `a`. The profit in this case is `n * a`.

2. **Promotion Case: b - a >= n**
   - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, Bob can sell all `n` buns with decreasing prices starting from `b` down to `b - n + 1`. The total profit can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \frac{(2b - n + 1) \cdot n}{2}
     \]

3. **General Case: b > a and b - a < n**
   - If the difference `b - a` is less than `n`, Bob should sell the first `b - a` buns at decreasing prices starting from `b` down to `a + 1`, and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price `a`. The total profit in this case is:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \frac{(b - a) \cdot (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \cdot n
     \]

### Analysis of the Code:

- The code correctly handles the three cases described above.
- For `b <= a`, it calculates the profit as `n * a`.
- For `b - a >= n`, it calculates the profit using the formula for the sum of the arithmetic series.
- For `b > a and b - a < n`, it calculates the profit by summing the series for the first `b - a` buns and adding the profit from the remaining buns sold at `a`.

### Verification with Examples:

- **First Test Case (4, 4, 5):**
  - Since `b > a` and `b - a < n`, the profit is calculated as:
    \[
    \text{Profit} = \frac{(5 - 4) \cdot (5 - 4 + 1)}{2} + 4 \cdot 4 = \frac{1 \cdot 2}{2} + 16 = 1 + 16 = 17
    \]
- **Second Test Case (5, 5, 9):**
  - Since `b - a >= n`, the profit is calculated as:
    \[
    \text{Profit} = \frac{(2 \cdot 9 - 5 + 1) \cdot 5}{2} = \frac{15 \cdot 5}{2} = 35
    \]
- **Third Test Case (10, 10, 5):**
  - Since `b <= a`, the profit is calculated as:
    \[
    \text{Profit} = 10 \cdot 10 = 100
    \]

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain, and it handles all the edge cases as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
