Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum profit in all cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the optimal `k` is flawed. Here's a more detailed explanation:

1. **Case 1: `b <= a`**  
   The program correctly handles this case by selling all buns at the usual price `a`.

2. **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**  
   The program correctly calculates the profit when `k = n` (all buns are sold at the modified price). The formula `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2` is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - n + 1`.

3. **Case 3: `b - a < n`**  
   The program incorrectly calculates the profit in this case. The formula `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n` does not correctly determine the optimal `k`. The optimal `k` should be determined by comparing the profit for different values of `k`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the maximum profit by iterating over possible values of `k` or using a more analytical approach to find the optimal `k` directly. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            # Calculate the maximum k where the modified price is greater than the usual price
            k = min(n, b - a + 1)
            # Calculate the profit for this k
            profit = (b + b - k + 1) * k // 2 + a * (n - k)
            print(profit)

func()
```

This corrected version iteratively determines the optimal `k` and calculates the profit accordingly.
