In the provided task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. The loop head only contains the variable `_` and `t`. The variable `_` is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not plan to use inside the loop. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

Given this, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The state of `t` is already given as an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, which means it is already in a valid state for the loop to execute.

Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head that we can adjust, and it is already in a valid state, no further adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**
