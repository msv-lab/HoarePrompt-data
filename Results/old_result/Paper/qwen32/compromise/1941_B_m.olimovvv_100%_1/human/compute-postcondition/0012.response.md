In the given initial state, the variables `t`, `a`, and `i` are described, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is greater than 2.
- `i` is `i + 1`, which implies that `i` is being incremented by 1, but the initial value of `i` is not specified.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables, the output will simply be the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
