The code snippet provided is a simple print statement that outputs the string 'NO', regardless of the values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `i` as described in the initial state. 

Here is the breakdown of the given information:
- `a` is greater than 4.
- `b` is a list of integers where `b[0]` is 0, `b[1]` is 0, `b[2]` is `b[2] - 2 * b[1]` (which simplifies to `b[2]` since `b[1]` is 0), and `b[3]` is `b[3] - 3 * b[1]` (which simplifies to `b[3]` since `b[1]` is 0).
- `i` is 2.

However, none of these variables affect the print statement `print('NO')`. The print statement is hardcoded to output the string 'NO'.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
