The code provided is a `break` statement, which will terminate the innermost loop or if statement it is placed within. However, since there is no loop or if statement provided in the context, the `break` statement itself does not change the values of the variables `t`, `a`, or `i`. The variable `i` is described as `i + 2`, but without a loop or context, this operation is not performed.

Thus, the values of `t`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 2, `i` is `i + 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
