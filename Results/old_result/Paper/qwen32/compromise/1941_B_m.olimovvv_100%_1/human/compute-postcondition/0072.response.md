Output State: **`a` is greater than 4, `b` is a list of integers where `b[0]` is 0, `b[1]` is 0, `b[2]` is `b[2] - 2 * b[1]`, `b[3]` is `b[3] - 3 * b[1]`, and `i` is 2; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms, the values of `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The `break` statement indicates that we exit the most internal loop or if statement without altering the values of the variables.
