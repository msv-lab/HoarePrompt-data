Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine if it is possible to make all the elements of the array zero using the described operations. The main issue is the incorrect logic used to manipulate the array elements and check if the final array is zero.

Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Incorrect Element Modification**: The program modifies the array elements in a way that does not reflect the actual operations described in the problem. Specifically, the line `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` is incorrect because it does not match the operation described, which is `a_i = a_i - 2`.

2. **Incorrect Termination Condition**: The program checks if `b[i] < 0` to determine if it should print "NO". However, the elements of the array are non-negative integers, and the operations described cannot make any element negative if the initial elements are non-negative. This check is unnecessary and incorrect.

3. **Final Check for Zeros**: The program checks if the last two elements are zero to determine if the array can be made zero. However, this is not sufficient to determine the correctness of the solution. The operations can affect multiple elements, and the program does not correctly simulate this process.

Here is a corrected version of the logic that should be used:

- The key observation is that for the array to be made zero, the sum of the array elements must be even because each operation decreases the sum by 4 (2 from `a_i` and 1 from `a_{i-1}` and `a_{i+1}`).
- Additionally, the first and last elements must be able to be reduced to zero using the operations, which imposes further constraints.

A correct approach involves checking these conditions and ensuring that the operations can be applied in a way that reduces all elements to zero. The provided program does not implement this logic correctly.
