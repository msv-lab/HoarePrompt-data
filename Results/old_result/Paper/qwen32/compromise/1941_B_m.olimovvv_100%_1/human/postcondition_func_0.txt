The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines if the list can be transformed to all zeros by repeatedly subtracting twice the current element from the next element and the current element from the element after next, starting from the first element. If the transformation is possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
