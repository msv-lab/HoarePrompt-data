In the given for loop, the only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0, because `i` will iterate from 0 to `t-1`.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to make sure that `t` is at least 1. The variable `i` is initialized automatically by the `range` function, so we don't need to adjust it manually before the loop starts.

The variables `n`, `s`, and `results` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted in the state for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
