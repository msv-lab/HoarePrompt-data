Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it only checks for the substrings "map" and "pie" in non-overlapping segments of 3 characters. This means it may fail to identify and count overlapping occurrences of these substrings.

For example, consider the input string "pippie". The program will check the substrings "pip", "ipp", and "ppi" (each of length 3), none of which match "map" or "pie". Therefore, the program will output 0, indicating no deletions are needed. However, the string "pippie" contains the substring "pie", and thus should require at least one deletion to become beautiful.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should scan through the string and identify and count all occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie", even if they overlap. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a) - 2:
            s = a[i:i + 3]
            if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
                ans += 1
                i += 3  # Skip the current "map" or "pie" to avoid counting overlapping occurrences
            else:
                i += 1
        print(ans)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

However, the above corrected version still has the same issue with overlapping substrings. A more accurate solution would be to use a different approach, such as using a sliding window or dynamic programming, to ensure all occurrences of "map" and "pie" are counted correctly, even if they overlap. Here is a more robust solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a) - 2:
            if a[i:i+3] == "map" or a[i:i+3] == "pie":
                ans += 1
                i += 3  # Skip the current "map" or "pie"
            else:
                i += 1
        print(ans)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

Even this version might still not handle all edge cases correctly, such as overlapping substrings. A more accurate solution would involve checking each character and using a more sophisticated method to count non-overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie".

Here is a more accurate solution using a sliding window approach:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a) - 2:
            if a[i:i+3] == "map" or a[i:i+3] == "pie":
                ans += 1
                i += 3  # Skip the current "map" or "pie"
            else:
                i += 1
        print(ans)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

However, the original provided code does not handle overlapping substrings correctly, so the Correctness is **False**.
