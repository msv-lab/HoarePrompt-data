Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the integer value from user input, `a` is a list of integers with at least 6 characters, `s` is `a[4:7]` if the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `s` is `a[2:5]`, `i` is 7 if the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 5, `ans` is 3 if the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans` is incremented by 1. If `s` was initially 'map' or 'pie', `ans` becomes 3; otherwise, `ans` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
