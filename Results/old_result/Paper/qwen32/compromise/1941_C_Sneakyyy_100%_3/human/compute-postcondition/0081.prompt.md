Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    ans = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(a) - 2:
        s = a[i:i + 3]
        if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
            i += 3
            ans += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an input integer, a is a string entered by the user, i is the largest index such that i < len(a) - 2 after the loop terminates, ans is the number of times the substring 'map' or 'pie' was found in a.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the integer value from user input, `a` is the string entered by the user, `i` is `i_final` (the largest multiple of 3 that is less than `len(a)` if the last chunk is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `len(a) - 2`), `ans` is `ans_final` (the total number of times 'map' or 'pie' appears in non-overlapping chunks of 3 characters in the string `a`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `len(a) - 2` such that the loop condition `i < len(a) - 2` fails, `ans` is the total number of times 'map' or 'pie' appears in non-overlapping segments of length 3 within the string `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
