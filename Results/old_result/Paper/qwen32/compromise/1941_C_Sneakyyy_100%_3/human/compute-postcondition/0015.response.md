The value of `i` is incremented by 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Given that the initial value of `i` is either 3 or 1, after the increment, `i` will be either 6 or 4. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, and `ans` remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string entered by the user with length at least 6 if `i` was 3, otherwise `a` has a length at least 3, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, `ans` is 1 if the original `s` was 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, `i` is 6 if the original `i` was 3, otherwise `i` is 4.**
