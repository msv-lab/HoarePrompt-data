The code snippet `s = a[i:i + 3]` assigns the substring of `a` starting from index `i` (which is 0) and ending at index `i + 3` (which is 3) to the variable `s`. Therefore, `s` will be the first three characters of the string `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string with length greater than 2, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, `s` is the first three characters of `a`.**
