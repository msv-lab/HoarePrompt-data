The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 2, so the new value of `i` is 3. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `ans`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string with length greater than 5, `i` is 3, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `s` is the substring of `a` from index 2 to 5**.
