The given code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within certain ranges, and `a` and `b` are lists of integers. However, the code only updates the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `nabors` must be greater than or equal to 1.**

In natural language, the output state means that `t` remains unchanged, while `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the values read from the input, maintaining their respective constraints. The lists `a` and `b` and the variable `nabors` remain unchanged.
