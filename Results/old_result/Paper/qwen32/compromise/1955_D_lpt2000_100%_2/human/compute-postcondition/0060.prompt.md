Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `nabors` must be greater than or equal to 1, `aa` is a list of strings representing integers read from input, `bb` is a list of strings representing integers read from input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in the list `bb`, `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` with counts being the minimum of the counts in `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`, `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`, `C` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` ≥ k else 0.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            pairs_in_D -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        D[in_aa] += 1
        pairs_in_D += 1
        C[in_aa] -= 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ m < n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `nabors` is greater than or equal to 1, `aa` is a list of strings representing integers read from input, `bb` is a list of strings representing integers read from input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in the list `bb`, `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` with counts being the minimum of the counts in `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`, `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`, and `C` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`. If `C[in_aa]` was greater than 0, then `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, and `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1. If `C[in_aa]` was 0, then `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` ≥ k else 0. If `D[out_aa]` was greater than 0, then `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, and either `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` was greater than 0, or `E[out_aa]` is set to 0 and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. If `D[out_aa]` was 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` ≥ k else `fnd` remains unchanged.

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
