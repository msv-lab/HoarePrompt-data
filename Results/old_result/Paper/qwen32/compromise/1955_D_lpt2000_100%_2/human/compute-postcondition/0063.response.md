The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This does not affect the existing variables `D`, `E`, `C`, `pairs_in_D`, and `fnd`.

Output State: **`D` is the intersection of the last `m` elements of `aa` and `bb`; `E` is the difference between the last `m` elements of `aa` and `D`; `C` is the difference between `bb` and `D`; `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in the final `D`; `fnd` is the total number of times `pairs_in_D` was at least `k` during the loop; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input.**
