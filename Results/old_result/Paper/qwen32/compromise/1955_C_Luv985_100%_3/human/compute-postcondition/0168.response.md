Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers from the input; `l` is 0 or 1; `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`; `ans` is 0, 1, or 2; `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`, `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are each decreased by `mi`, and if `a[r]` is 0, `r` is set to `n - 2`, `l` is set to 1, and `ans` is set to 2. Otherwise, if `mi * 2 > k`, and if `a[l] - t - k // 2` is 0, then `ans` is set to 1.**
