Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0 minus `mi * 2`, `a` is a list of integers from the input with `a[0]` decreased by `mi` and `a[n-1]` decreased by `mi`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n-1`, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`.**

The value of `k` has been updated to be `k - mi * 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
