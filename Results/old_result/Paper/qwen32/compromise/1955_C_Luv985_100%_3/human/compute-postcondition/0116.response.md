Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is at least 1 and has been decremented by `2 * mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `k` remains unchanged; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` has been updated to `a[l] - mi` and `a[r]` has been updated to `a[r] - mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged; `l` is 1 (if `l` was 0 before) or 2 (if `l` was 1 before) or 0 (if `a[l]` was not 0) if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `l` remains 0 or 1; `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` if `a[r]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `r` remains `n - 1` or `n - 2`; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` after the modification if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `mi` remains the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`; `ans` is 1, 2, 3, or 4 if `a[l]` was 0 and `a[r]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `ans` is 1, 2, or 3 if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `ans` is 1, 2, or 3 if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, otherwise `ans` remains 0, 1, or 2; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `mi * 2 > k` and `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`.**
