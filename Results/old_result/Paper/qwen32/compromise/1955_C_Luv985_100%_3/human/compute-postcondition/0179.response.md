Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0 minus `mi * 2`, `a` is a list of integers from the input with `a[0]` decreased by `mi` and `a[n-1]` decreased by `mi`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is `n-2`, `l` is 1, and `ans` is 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, `r` is `n-1`, `l` remains 0, and `ans` remains 1, 2, or 3. `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`.**
