Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `l` and `r` are set based on the condition `mi * 2 <= k`, `ans` is updated based on the condition and the values of `a[l]`, `a[r]`, `t`, and `k`, and `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. Specifically, if `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are each decreased by `mi`, and `r` and `ans` are updated as described. Otherwise, `l` remains 0, `r` remains `n-1`, and `ans` is updated based on whether `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`.**
