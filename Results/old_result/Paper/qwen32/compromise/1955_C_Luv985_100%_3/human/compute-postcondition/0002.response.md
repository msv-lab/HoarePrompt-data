To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the loop condition `while T:`. The loop will execute as long as `T` is a truthy value. In Python, any non-zero integer is considered truthy, and zero is considered falsy.

Given the state right before the `while` loop:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `T` is the number of test cases read from the input.
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.

The only variable in the loop head is `T`. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `T` must be a non-zero value.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `T` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0; `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
