Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**

Natural Language: The value of `T` has been decreased by 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
