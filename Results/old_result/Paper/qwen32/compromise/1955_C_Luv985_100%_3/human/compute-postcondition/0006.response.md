The code snippet converts the string `k` to an integer. Therefore, the variable `k` will now hold an integer value instead of a string representation of an integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
