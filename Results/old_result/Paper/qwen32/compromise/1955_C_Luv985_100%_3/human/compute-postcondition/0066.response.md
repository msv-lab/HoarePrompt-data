Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is 0 or a positive integer less than `2 * min(a[l], a[r])`; `a` is a list of `n` integers with some elements potentially reduced to 0; `l` is equal to `r`; `ans` is an integer representing the number of elements in `a` that have been reduced to 0.**
