Postcondition: **`t` is `k % 2`, `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `l` and `r` are set based on the condition `mi * 2 <= k`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`. If `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` has been incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
