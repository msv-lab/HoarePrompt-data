The code snippet `n, k = input().split()` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the first part to `n` and the second part to `k`. This means that the values of `n` and `k` will be updated to the values provided by the input, and they will be strings initially. After the assignment, `n` and `k` need to be converted to integers for any further calculations.

Given the initial state, `n` and `k` are integers, but after the `input().split()`, they will be strings. Therefore, the Output State will reflect this change.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` and `k` are strings representing integers where 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ int(k) ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
