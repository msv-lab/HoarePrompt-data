The code snippet `a[r] -= mi` decrements the value at index `r` of the list `a` by the value of `mi`. Given that `r` is `n - 1`, the value at the last index of the list `a` is decreased by `mi`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers from the input where `a[0]` has been decreased by `mi` and `a[n-1]` has been decreased by `mi`; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is 0; `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. Additionally, `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`.**
