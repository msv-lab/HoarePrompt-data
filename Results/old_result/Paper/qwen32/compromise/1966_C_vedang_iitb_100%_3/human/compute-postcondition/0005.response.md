The code sorts the list `a`. After sorting, `a` will be in non-decreasing order. The values of `t`, `n`, and `maxsize` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.**
