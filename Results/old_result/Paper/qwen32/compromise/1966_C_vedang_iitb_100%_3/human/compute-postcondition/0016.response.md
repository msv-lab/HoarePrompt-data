Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`. If `sz` equals `mexsize`, `mexsize` is updated to either 3 or 4 based on its initial value (if `mexsize` was initially 2, it becomes 3, and if `mexsize` was initially 3, it becomes 4). Otherwise, `mexsize` remains unchanged. `sz` is the next element in the list `a`.**
