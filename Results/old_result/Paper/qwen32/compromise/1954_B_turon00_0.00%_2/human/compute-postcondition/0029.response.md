The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `aa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`; `cnt` is the count of the last sequence of elements equal to `tmp`; `ans` is the minimum count of any sequence of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` encountered during the loop, updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.**
