The code snippet sets `cnt` to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, and `ans`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`; `cnt` is 0.**
