The only variable in the loop head of the provided `for` loop is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `t`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. Given that the problem states `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, this condition is already satisfied by the problem constraints. Therefore, no adjustment to `t` is necessary to ensure the loop executes.

However, since the task specifies that we need to adhere to the format and only adjust the state of objects in the loop head, we can state that `t` must be within the given range to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4**
