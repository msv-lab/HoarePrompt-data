The given code snippet is `cnt = 0`. This line of code sets the variable `cnt` to 0. None of the other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`; `aa` is a set of unique integers from the list `a`; `cnt` is 0; `ans` is 0; the element `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`.**
