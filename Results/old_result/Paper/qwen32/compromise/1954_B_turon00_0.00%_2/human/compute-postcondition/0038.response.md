Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the input integer; `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`; `aa` is a set of unique integers from the list `a`. If the length of `aa` is 1, the list `a` contains identical integers. Otherwise, the list `a` contains at least one unique integer different from the others; `cnt` is 0.**

In natural language: The list `a`, integer `t`, integer `n`, variable `tmp`, and set `aa` remain unchanged. The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0.
