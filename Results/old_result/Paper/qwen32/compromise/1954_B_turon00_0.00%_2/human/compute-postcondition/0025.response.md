The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.**
