The code provided only increments the variable `cnt` by 1. None of the other variables (`a`, `t`, `n`, `tmp`, `aa`, `i`) are affected by this operation. Therefore, the values of `a`, `t`, `n`, `tmp`, `aa`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`; `aa` is a set of unique integers from the list `a`; `i` is `t + 1`; `cnt` is increased by 1.**
