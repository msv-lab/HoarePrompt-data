The provided code snippet simply resets the value of `cnt` to 0. None of the other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change while keeping all other variables in their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `aa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`; `cnt` is 0; `ans` is 0; `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`**
