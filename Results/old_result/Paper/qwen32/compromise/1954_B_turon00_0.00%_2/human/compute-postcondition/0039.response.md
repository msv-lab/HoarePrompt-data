The code snippet assigns the value of `n` to the variable `ans`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the input integer; `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`; `aa` is a set of unique integers from the list `a`. If the length of `aa` is 1, the list `a` contains identical integers. Otherwise, the list `a` contains at least one unique integer different from the others; `cnt` is 0; `ans` is the input integer `n`.**
