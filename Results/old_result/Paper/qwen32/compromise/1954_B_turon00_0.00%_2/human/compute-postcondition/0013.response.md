The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `aa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`; `cnt` is 1; `ans` is `n`. The current element `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`.**
