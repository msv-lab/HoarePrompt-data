Reasoning:
The provided program's logic does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program calculates the minimum length of consecutive elements in the list that are equal to the first element and then prints that value. However, the problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful, not the minimum length of consecutive elements equal to the first element.

The program does correctly handle the case where all elements are the same by outputting `-1`. However, for other cases, it does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove. The program does not consider the entire structure of the array and the operations allowed to make it non-beautiful.

The correct approach would involve analyzing the array to find segments that can be made uniform by the allowed operations and then determining the minimum removals required to break these segments.

Given the program does not implement the correct logic, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
