You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

    #State: After all iterations, `t` is 0, and for each iteration, the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element of the list `a` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it prints the minimum length of consecutive elements in the list that are equal to the first element of the list, or `-1` if all elements in the list are the same.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`. If it's impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements, the output should be `-1`.

### Key Observations:
1. **All Elements Same:** If all elements of the array are the same, it will always be beautiful regardless of how many elements are removed. In this case, the output should be `-1`.
2. **Longest Sequence of Same Elements:** To make the array not beautiful, we need to break the longest sequence of the same elements. The minimum number of elements to remove is the length of the longest sequence minus one, because removing one element from the longest sequence will prevent it from being fully replaced by adjacent elements.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Reading the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, reading the size of the array and the array itself.
3. Checking if all elements are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`.
4. Otherwise, it tries to find the length of the longest sequence of the same elements and prints the length of that sequence minus one.

### Issues in the Program:
The main issue with the program is in the logic to find the longest sequence of the same elements. The current implementation only checks sequences of the first element (`tmp = a[0]`). This is incorrect because there could be a longer sequence of a different element.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the longest sequence of any element in the array, not just the first one. Here's the corrected logic:
1. Initialize variables to keep track of the longest sequence length and the current sequence length.
2. Iterate through the array, updating the current sequence length when consecutive elements are the same.
3. Reset the current sequence length when consecutive elements are different.
4. Track the maximum sequence length encountered.
5. The answer is the maximum sequence length minus one, unless all elements are the same, in which case the answer is `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly find the longest sequence of any element in the array.

Correctness: **False**
