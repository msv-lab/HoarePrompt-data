To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure both conditions in the loop head are satisfied:

1. `k` must be non-zero.
2. `len(nums)` must be greater than or equal to 2.

Given the initial states:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15.
- `nums` is a deque of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.
- `ans` is 0.

The only variables in the loop head that can be adjusted are `k` and `nums`.

- For `k` to be non-zero, it is already satisfied because `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15.
- For `len(nums)` to be greater than or equal to 2, we need to ensure that `nums` has at least 2 integers.

Since `n` is the length of `nums` and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `n` being at least 2 would ensure `len(nums)` is at least 2. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n` itself, but we need to ensure the state of `nums` reflects that it has at least 2 integers.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 2, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a deque of `n` integers (where `n` ≥ 2) where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and `ans` is 0**.
