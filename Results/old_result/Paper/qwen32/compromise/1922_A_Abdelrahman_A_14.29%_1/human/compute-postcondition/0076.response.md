Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State
- `tests` is greater than 0.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.
- `a` is a new input string.
- `b` is a new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
- `c` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements.
- `i` is 2.
- `slength` is the integer value provided by the input.
- `no` is False if `x` is not in `a` and `x` is not in `b`, otherwise `no` remains True.
- `x` is the element at index 2 in `c`.

### Code Snippet
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. The string `'YES'` is directly printed to the console.

### Output
Output: **YES**
