Postcondition: **`tests` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new input string, `i` is 1, `slength` is the new input integer, and `no` is False if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`; otherwise, `no` is True.**
