The only variable in the loop head is `x` and the iterable is the string `c`. Therefore, we can only adjust the state of `x` to reflect the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given that `x` is the current character being processed in the string `c`, at the start of the next iteration, `x` should be the next character in the string `c`.

Since `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, this indicates that the loop has just started or has completed one iteration. To proceed to the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` to 1, and `x` to the character at index 1 in the string `c`.

State: **`tests` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is an input string, `b` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 1, `slength` is an input integer, `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, and `x` is the character at index 1 in `c`**.
