Postcondition: **`tests` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `slength` is the integer value provided by the input, and `no` is False if `x` is not in `a` and `x` is not in `b`, otherwise `no` remains True. If `x` is not in `a` and `x` is not in `b`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
