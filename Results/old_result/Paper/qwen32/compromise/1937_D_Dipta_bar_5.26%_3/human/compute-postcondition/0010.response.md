The code snippet `r = len(B)` calculates the length of list `B` and assigns it to the variable `r`. The length of list `B` is 4, as it contains four elements: [0, 2, 4, 7]. 

The other variables (`A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, and `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **A is [0, 2, 4]; idx_A is [1, 3, 4]; B is [0, 2, 4, 7]; idx_B is [4, 2, 1, 0]; l is 0; r is 4**.
