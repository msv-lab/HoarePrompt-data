The code `hcf = gcd(hcf, num)` updates the value of `hcf` to be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the current `hcf` and `num`. The other variables, including the list `numbers`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`hcf` is the GCD of the previous `hcf` and `num`, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, and the second element is the start of the test cases data.**
