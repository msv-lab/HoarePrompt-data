The function `calculate_hcf(numbers)` is not relevant to the problem description provided. The correct function definition for the problem should be `def distribute_bets(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, followed by a list of `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for each outcome. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
