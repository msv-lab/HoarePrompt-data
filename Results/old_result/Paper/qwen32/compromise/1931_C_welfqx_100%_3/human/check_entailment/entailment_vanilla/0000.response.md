Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to make all elements of an array equal by performing at most one operation. The operation allows us to select a contiguous subarray and assign all its elements the same value. The cost of this operation is the length of the subarray. We need to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it performs the following steps:
1. Checks if all elements in the array are already the same. If yes, the cost is 0.
2. Otherwise, it finds the longest prefix of the array with all identical elements (`cn`).
3. It also finds the longest suffix of the array with all identical elements (`ck`).
4. If the first and last elements of the array are the same, it adds the lengths of the longest prefix and suffix.
5. Finally, it prints the cost as `n - max(cn, ck)`.

### Issues in the Program:
The program's logic is flawed. It only considers the longest prefix and suffix of identical elements and assumes that the optimal solution will involve making either the entire prefix or suffix uniform. However, this is not always the case. There might be a better solution that involves selecting a subarray in the middle of the array.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```
- The longest prefix with identical elements is `1` (length 1).
- The longest suffix with identical elements is `1` (length 1).
- The first and last elements are the same, so the program calculates `cn + ck = 2`.
- The program then calculates the cost as `5 - max(2, 2) = 3`.

However, the optimal solution is to select the subarray `[2, 3, 2]` and assign all elements to `2`, which costs `3 - 1 = 2`. Alternatively, selecting the subarray `[3]` and assigning all elements to `3` costs `1`, but the problem allows only one operation, and the optimal solution here is to make the whole array `2` by selecting `[2, 3, 2]`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not always find the correct minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
