### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
You need to make all elements of an array equal by performing at most one operation. The operation allows you to select a contiguous subarray and assign all its elements the same value. The cost of this operation is the length of the subarray. The task is to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Check if all elements are the same:**
   - If all elements are the same, the cost is `0` because no operation is needed.
   - This part of the program is correct.

2. **Find the longest prefix and suffix of identical elements:**
   - `cn` is the length of the longest prefix where all elements are the same.
   - `ck` is the length of the longest suffix where all elements are the same.
   - This part of the program is correct.

3. **Combine prefix and suffix if the first and last elements are the same:**
   - If the first and last elements are the same, it means the array can be divided into three parts: the prefix, the middle part, and the suffix, where the prefix and suffix are identical.
   - In this case, the program combines the lengths of the prefix and suffix to form a contiguous block of identical elements.
   - This part of the logic is also correct.

4. **Calculate the minimum cost:**
   - The cost to make the entire array equal by changing either the prefix or the suffix is `n - max(cn, ck)`.
   - This formula is based on the idea that if you can make the longest contiguous block of identical elements equal to the rest of the array, the cost is minimized.
   - This logic is flawed because it does not consider other possible subarrays in the middle of the array that could result in a lower cost.

#### Counterexample:
The original assessment provides a counterexample:
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```
- The longest prefix with identical elements is `1` (length 1).
- The longest suffix with identical elements is `1` (length 1).
- The first and last elements are the same, so the program calculates `cn + ck = 2`.
- The program then calculates the cost as `5 - max(2, 2) = 3`.

However, the optimal solution is to select the subarray `[2, 3, 2]` and assign all elements to `2`, which costs `3 - 1 = 2`. Alternatively, selecting the subarray `[3]` and assigning all elements to `3` costs `1`, but the problem allows only one operation, and the optimal solution here is to make the whole array `2` by selecting `[2, 3, 2]`.

This counterexample demonstrates that the program does not always find the correct minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.

### Conclusion:
The program does not always find the correct minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
