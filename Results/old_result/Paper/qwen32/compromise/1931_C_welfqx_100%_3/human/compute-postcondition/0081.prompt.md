Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from `onum[0]` up to `onum[n-2]` if all are equal, otherwise the count of consecutive equal elements until the first inequality is found. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, then `cn` is the previous value of `cn` plus `ck`. Otherwise, `cn` remains unchanged, `r` is the current value of `r` plus 1; `n` is an input integer; `f` is 1; `num` is a list of integers read from the input.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n - 1):
    if num[j] != num[j + 1]:
        f = 0
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be at least 2, `j` is 0. If `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, then `f` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change is made to `f` and the loop or if statement does not break.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be at least 2, `j` is 1. If `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, `f` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to `f` and the loop or if statement does not break.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be at least 3, `j` is 2, and `f` is 0 if `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`. If `num[j]` is equal to `num[j + 1]`, `f` remains unchanged and no break occurs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
