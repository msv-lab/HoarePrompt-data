The code snippet `ck += 1` increments the value of `ck` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`f` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `num` is a list of integers from the input, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `ck` is 2, `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, `r` is the initial value of `r` plus (n - 1), `ii` is 0, and `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `ck` is now 2, while all other variables retain their initial values.
