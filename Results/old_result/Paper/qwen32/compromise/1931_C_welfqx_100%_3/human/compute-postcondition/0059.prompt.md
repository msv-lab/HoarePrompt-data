Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `num` is a list of integers read from the input, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from `num[0]` up to `num[n-2]` if all are equal, otherwise the count of consecutive equal elements until the first inequality is found, `ck` is 1, `i` is `n - 2` if all elements are equal, otherwise the index where the inequality is found.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(n - 1):
    if onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]:
        ck += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `num` is a list of integers read from the input, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from `num[0]` up to `num[n-2]` if all are equal, otherwise the count of consecutive equal elements until the first inequality is found, `ck` is 2 if `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, otherwise `ck` is 1, and `i` is `n - 2` if all elements are equal, otherwise the index where the inequality is found.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `num` is a list of integers read from the input, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from `num[0]` up to `num[n-2]` if all are equal, otherwise the count of consecutive equal elements until the first inequality is found, `ck` is 3 if `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, otherwise `ck` is 2, and `i` is `n - 2` if all elements are equal, otherwise the index where the inequality is found, `ii` is `ii + 1`. If `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, `ck` is set to 3; otherwise, `ck` is set to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `num` is a list of integers read from the input, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from `num[0]` up to `num[n-2]` if all are equal, otherwise the count of consecutive equal elements until the first inequality is found, `ck` is 4 if `onum[ii]` was equal to `onum[ii + 1]` initially and then remains 4, otherwise `ck` is 3, and `i` is `n - 2` if all elements are equal, otherwise the index where the inequality is found, `ii` is `ii + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
