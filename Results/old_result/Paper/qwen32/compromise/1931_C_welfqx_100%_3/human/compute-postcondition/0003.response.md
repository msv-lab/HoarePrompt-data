The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `f`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `f` is 1.**
