Output State: **`f` is 1; `n` is the same; `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`; `ck` is `n`; `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num` plus `n`. Additionally, `symb1` is equal to `symb2`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `cn` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value and `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
