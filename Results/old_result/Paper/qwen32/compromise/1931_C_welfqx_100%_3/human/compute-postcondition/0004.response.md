The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `num`. This operation does not affect the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, or `f`. The variable `num` is newly introduced and will hold the list of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers read from the input.**
