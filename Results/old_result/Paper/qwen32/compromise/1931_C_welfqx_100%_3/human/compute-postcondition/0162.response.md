The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust those variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2` (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 3, and `n` is at least 2.

To execute one more iteration, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must remain the same (since it is the upper limit of the range).

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` was 3.
- `n` is at least 2.

For the next iteration:
- `i` should be 4 (since it is incremented by 1).
- `n` should remain at least 2 (since it is the upper limit of the range).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`f` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `num` is a list of integers from the input, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `ck` is 1, `cn` is 2 if `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, otherwise `cn` is 1, and `r` is the initial value of `r` plus the number of iterations completed by the loop, `i` is 4**
