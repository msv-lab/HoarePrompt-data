Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    f = 1
    num = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]
    for j in range(n - 1):
        if num[j] != num[j + 1]:
            f = 0
            break
    if n == 1 or f == 1:
        print(0)
        continue
    onum = num.copy()
    onum.reverse()
    cn = 1
    ck = 1
    f = 1
    symb1 = num[0]
    symb2 = onum[0]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if num[i] == num[i + 1]:
            cn += 1
        else:
            break
    for ii in range(n - 1):
        if onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]:
            ck += 1
        else:
            break
    if symb1 == symb2:
        cn += ck
    print(n - max(cn, ck))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from `onum[0]` up to `onum[n-2]` if all are equal, otherwise the count of consecutive equal elements until the first inequality is found. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, then `cn` is the previous value of `cn` plus `ck`. Otherwise, `cn` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `f` is 1; `n` is the same; `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`; `ck` is `n`; `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`. Additionally, if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, then `cn` is increased by `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: f is 1; n is the input integer; num is a list of integers from the input; onum is a reversed copy of num; symb1 is the first element of num; symb2 is the last element of num; cn is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of num; r is the initial value of r plus (n - 1); ck is the count of the longest sequence of consecutive equal elements starting from onum[0]. If symb1 is equal to symb2, then cn is updated to the sum of the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of num and the count of the longest sequence of consecutive equal elements starting from onum[0].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
