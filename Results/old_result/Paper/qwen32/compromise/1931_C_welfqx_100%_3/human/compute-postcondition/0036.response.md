The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is at least 2. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`, which means `i` should be `n - 2` again, but since we are moving to the next iteration, `i` is now `n - 1`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `num` is a list of integers read from the input, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is 2. Otherwise, `cn` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `i` is `n - 1`**
