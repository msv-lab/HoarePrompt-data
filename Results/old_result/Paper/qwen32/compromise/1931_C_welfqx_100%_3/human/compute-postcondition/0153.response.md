Output State: **`f` is 1; `n` is the input integer and is either 1 or `f` is 1; `num` is a list of integers from the input; `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`; `ck` is 1; `cn` is 1; `r` is the initial value of `r` plus the number of iterations completed by the loop.**

Explanation: The value of `f` has been set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged as the code snippet only modifies `f`.
