Output State: **`f` is 1; `n` is 2 (or greater); `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`; `cn` is 1; `ck` is 1; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`; `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The values of the variables `f`, `n`, `onum`, `cn`, `ck`, `symb1`, and `symb2` remain unchanged. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
