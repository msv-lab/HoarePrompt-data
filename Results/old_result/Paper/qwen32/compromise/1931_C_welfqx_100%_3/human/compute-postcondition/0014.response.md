The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `n`. If `j` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 again from its current value.

Given that `j` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, if `j` was `k` at the start of that iteration, it would be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration. Since the loop condition is `j in range(n - 1)`, `j` must be less than `n - 1` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `num` is a list of integers read from the input, `j` is incremented by 1 (so `j` is now the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1)**

Since `j` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, if `j` was `k` at the start of the previous iteration, it is now `k + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n - 1`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `num` is a list of integers read from the input, `j` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `j` at the start of the previous iteration, and `j` must be less than `n - 1`**

To simplify, if `j` was `k` at the start of the previous iteration, it is now `k + 1`:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `num` is a list of integers read from the input, `j` is incremented by 1**

Since `j` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, if `j` was `k` at the start of the previous iteration, it is now `k + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n - 1`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `num` is a list of integers read from the input, `j` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `j` at the start of the previous iteration**

Since we need to express it clearly and adjust only the loop head variable `j`:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `num` is a list of integers read from the input, `j` is incremented by 1**

Since `j` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it is now `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `j` at the start of the previous iteration. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n - 1`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `num` is a list of integers read from the input, `j` is incremented by 1**

To clearly state the next iteration's beginning:

Since `j` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it is now `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `j` at the start of the previous iteration. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n - 1`.
