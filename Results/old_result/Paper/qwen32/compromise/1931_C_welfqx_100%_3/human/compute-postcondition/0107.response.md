To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the behavior and the given conditions of the loop.

The loop iterates `n - 1` times, where `n` is the length of the list `num`. The loop checks if consecutive elements in `num` are equal and increments `cn` if they are. If two consecutive elements are not equal, the loop breaks.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:

1. The loop will run `n - 1` times.
2. `cn` will be incremented each time the loop runs if the condition `num[i] == num[i + 1]` is true.
3. The loop will break if `num[i] != num[i + 1]` at any point.
4. The variables `f`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, and `ck` remain unchanged throughout the loop.

Let's determine the final state:

- The loop will iterate `n - 1` times, and `cn` will be incremented for each iteration where `num[i] == num[i + 1]`.
- If the loop runs `n - 1` times without breaking, it means all elements in `num` are the same, and `cn` will be equal to `n`.
- If the loop breaks at any point, `cn` will be equal to the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element.
- The variables `f`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, and `ck` remain unchanged.

Thus, the final output state will be:

- `f` remains 1.
- `n` remains the same.
- `onum` remains a reversed copy of `num`.
- `symb1` remains the first element of `num`.
- `symb2` remains the last element of `num`.
- `ck` remains 1.
- `cn` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, which can be up to `n` if all elements are the same.

Output State: **`f` is 1; `n` is the same; `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`; `ck` is 1; `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`.**
