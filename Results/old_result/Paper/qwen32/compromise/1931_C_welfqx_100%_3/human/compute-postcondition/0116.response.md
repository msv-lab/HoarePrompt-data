The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables; it only exits the nearest enclosing loop or `switch` statement. Since there is no loop or `switch` statement provided in the context, the variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`f` is 1; `n` is greater than 4; `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`; `ii` is 4**.
