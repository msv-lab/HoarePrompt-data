The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` must be at least 2. Since the loop did not break out of the most internal loop or if statement, it means that `num[j]` was equal to `num[j + 1]`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1. The condition `j < n - 1` must still be satisfied for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `j` is 1**
