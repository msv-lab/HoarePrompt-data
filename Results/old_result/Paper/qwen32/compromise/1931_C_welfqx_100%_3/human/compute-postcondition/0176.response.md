Postcondition: **`f` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `num` is a list of integers from the input, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, `r` is the initial value of `r` plus (n - 1), `ii` is 0. If `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, then `ck` is 2; otherwise, `ck` is 1.**
