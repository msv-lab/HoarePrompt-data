To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. The for loop statement is:

```python
for j in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `j`, and the range is determined by `n - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to 1, which means `n` must be at least 2.

The other variables mentioned (`t`, `a`, `f`, `num`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted for the loop's execution.

Given the above analysis, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `n` is at least 2. The other variables can remain as they are since they do not affect the execution of the loop itself.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers read from the input**
