To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `n` is the first integer from the input.
   - `k` is the second integer from the input and must be less than 8 but at least 4.
   - `nums` is a list defined as `[1, 2, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - 2, k + 1, k + 3]`.
   - `idx` is set to 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(len(nums))
   ```

3. **Determine the length of the list `nums`:**
   - The list `nums` contains 23 fixed elements: `[1, 2, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]`.
   - Additionally, it contains 3 elements derived from `k`: `k - 2`, `k + 1`, and `k + 3`.
   - Therefore, the total number of elements in `nums` is 23 (fixed elements) + 3 (derived from `k`) = 26.

4. **Output:**
   The `print(len(nums))` statement will output the length of the list `nums`, which is 26.

Output: **26**
