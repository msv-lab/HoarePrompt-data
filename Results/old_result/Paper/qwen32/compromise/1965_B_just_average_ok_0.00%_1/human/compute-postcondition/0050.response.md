The code appends a new value to the list `nums`. The new value is calculated as `k + nums[idx] + 1`. Given that `idx` is 2, `nums[idx]` is `nums[2]`, which is 4. Therefore, the new value to be appended is `k + 4 + 1`, which simplifies to `k + 5`.

The initial state specifies that `k` is at least 4 but less than 8. Therefore, `k + 5` will be at least 9 and less than 13.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `idx`) remain unchanged. The list `nums` now has an additional element at the end, which is `k + 5`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be less than 8 but at least 4; `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, `k - 4`, `k + 1`, `k + 5`]; `idx` is 2.**
