The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state provided includes specific conditions for `t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums`, but after executing the code, only `n` and `k` will be reassigned based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be less than 8 but at least 4; `nums` is a list `[1, 2, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - 2, k + 1, k + 3]`; `idx` is 1**

In simpler terms: The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integers provided in the input, while all other variables remain unchanged.
