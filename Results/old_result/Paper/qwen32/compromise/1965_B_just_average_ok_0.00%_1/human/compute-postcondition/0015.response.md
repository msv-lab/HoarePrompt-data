The code removes the element at the position `1 << idx` from the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is 2, `1 << idx` evaluates to `1 << 2` which is 4. Therefore, the element at index 4 in the list `nums` is removed. The element at index 4 in the list `nums` is 16. After removing 16, the list `nums` will be updated accordingly.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be less than 8 but at least 4; `nums` is a list `[1, 2, 4, 8, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - 4, k + 1, k + 5]`; `idx` is 2.**
