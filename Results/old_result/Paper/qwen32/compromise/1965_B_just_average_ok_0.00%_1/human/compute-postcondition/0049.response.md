The code snippet appends the value of `k + 1` to the list `nums`. Given the initial state, we know that `nums` initially contains a predefined sequence of numbers, and `k` is an integer such that 4 ≤ k < 8. The last element of `nums` before the append operation is `k - 4`. After appending `k + 1`, the new last element of `nums` will be `k + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be less than 8 but at least 4; `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, `k - 4`, `k + 1`]; `idx` is 2.**
