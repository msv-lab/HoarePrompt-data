The loop condition is `k >= 1 << idx`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `k` and/or `idx` such that the condition remains true.

Given:
- `k` is the second integer from the input and must be less than 8 but at least 4.
- `idx` is 1.

Let's analyze the condition `k >= 1 << idx`:
- `1 << idx` is a bitwise left shift operation, which is equivalent to \(2^{idx}\).

For `idx` being 1:
- `1 << 1` equals 2.

To satisfy the condition `k >= 2`:
- Since `k` is already given to be at least 4, the condition `k >= 2` is already satisfied.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure `k` is still greater than or equal to the next power of 2 after `1 << idx` (which is `1 << (idx + 1)`).

For `idx` being 1:
- The next power of 2 is `1 << 2` which equals 4.

Since `k` is at least 4 and less than 8, the only way to ensure the loop executes one more time is to keep `idx` as 1 and ensure `k` remains at least 4.

Thus, no adjustment is needed for `k` as it is already in the required range. The only variable we can adjust is `idx`, but since we need the loop to execute one more time and `idx` being 1 already satisfies the condition with the given range of `k`, we do not need to change `idx`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be less than 8 but at least 4; `nums` is a list `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]`; `idx` is 1**
