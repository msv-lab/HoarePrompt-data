To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables `k` and `idx` as they are the only ones mentioned in the loop condition.

The loop condition is `k >= 1 << idx`. For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than or equal to `2^idx`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `n` is the first integer from the input (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `k` is the second integer from the input and must be less than 8 but at least 4.
- `nums` is a predefined list of integers (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `idx` is 2.

Let's evaluate the condition `k >= 1 << idx` with the current values:
- `1 << idx` is `1 << 2`, which equals 4.
- The condition `k >= 4` must hold true for the loop to execute.

Since `k` is specified to be at least 4 and less than 8, `k` can be 4, 5, 6, or 7. If `k` is 4, the condition `k >= 4` is satisfied, and the loop can execute.

However, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `k` is still greater than or equal to `2^idx`. Since `idx` is 2, we need `k >= 4`.

Given that `idx` is 2, we do not need to adjust `idx` because the loop condition will still be satisfied as long as `k` remains at least 4. Therefore, no further adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be less than 8 but at least 4; `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]; `idx` is 2**
