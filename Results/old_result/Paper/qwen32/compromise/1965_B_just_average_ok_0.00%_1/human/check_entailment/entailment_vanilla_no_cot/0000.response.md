To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify if it meets the problem's requirements for all possible valid inputs. The program is supposed to generate a sequence of non-negative integers that satisfies two conditions:

1. There is no subsequence of the sequence with a sum of \( k \).
2. For all \( 1 \le v \le n \) where \( v \ne k \), there is a subsequence of the sequence with a sum of \( v \).

Let's analyze the provided code:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]
        idx = 0
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        idx -= 1
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)
```

### Analysis:

1. **Generating Initial Sequence:**
   - The sequence `nums` is initially generated using powers of 2: `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^23]`.
   - This sequence can generate all sums from 1 to \( 2^{24} - 1 \) through combinations of its elements.

2. **Adjusting for \( k \):**
   - The code identifies the highest power of 2 that is less than \( k \).
   - It then modifies the sequence to ensure that no subsequence sums to \( k \) while still allowing all other sums from 1 to \( n \) (except \( k \)).

3. **Modifications:**
   - It removes the identified power of 2.
   - Adds three new numbers to the sequence: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - These modifications are intended to ensure that the sequence can still generate all sums except \( k \).

### Verification:

- **Generating All Sums Except \( k \):**
  - The initial sequence can generate all sums except the one removed power of 2.
  - The added numbers are carefully chosen to fill in the gaps and maintain the property that no subsequence sums to \( k \).

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code handles small values of \( n \) and \( k \) correctly.
  - It also handles cases where \( k \) is a power of 2 or close to a power of 2.

### Conclusion:

The provided code appears to correctly generate a sequence that satisfies the problem's conditions. It ensures that no subsequence sums to \( k \) while still allowing all other sums from 1 to \( n \) (except \( k \)).

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
