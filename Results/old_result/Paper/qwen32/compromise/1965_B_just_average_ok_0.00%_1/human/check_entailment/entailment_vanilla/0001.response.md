Let's break down the problem and the provided program to see if it meets the requirements.

### Problem Recap:
We need to create a sequence `a` of non-negative integers such that:
1. There is no subsequence of `a` that sums to `k`.
2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

### Program Analysis:
The program generates a sequence based on powers of 2, which is a well-known way to generate all possible sums up to a certain number (specifically, up to the sum of the first `m` powers of 2, which is `2^(m+1) - 1`). The program then adjusts this sequence to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Initialization**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. **For each test case**:
   - It reads `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes a list `nums` with the first 24 powers of 2 (`[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^23]`).
   - It finds the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` and removes it from the list.
   - It adds three additional numbers to the list:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This ensures that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence.
     - `k + 1`: This ensures that `k + 1` can be formed.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This ensures that `k + nums[idx] + 1` can be formed.
3. **Output**: It prints the length of the adjusted list and the list itself.

### Correctness Check:
1. **Subsequences Summing to `v` for `1 ≤ v ≤ n` and `v ≠ k`**:
   - The initial list `nums` contains the first 24 powers of 2, which can form all sums from 1 to `2^24 - 1`.
   - By adding `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, we ensure that these sums can be formed.
   - The removal of `nums[idx]` and the addition of `k - nums[idx]` should not prevent the formation of any other sums up to `n` except `k`.

2. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`**:
   - The removal of `nums[idx]` and the addition of `k - nums[idx]` ensures that the exact sum `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to correctly adjust the sequence to meet the problem's requirements. It generates a sequence that can form all sums from 1 to `n` except `k`, and it ensures that no subsequence sums to `k`.

Thus, the program appears to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
