The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the elements in the list `nums`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` for the next iteration. Since `i` takes the value of each element in `nums` sequentially, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `nums`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4.
- `n` is the new input integer.
- `nums` is the new list of integers read from input and must have at least 1 element.
- `last` is the last element of `nums`.
- If `i` is not equal to 0, `curr` is updated to `curr + i - last`. Otherwise, `curr` remains 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the last element of `nums` (which is `last`). For the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `nums`. If the previous `i` was the last element, then the loop would have ended. However, if we are considering the state right before the loop ends, `i` would be the second-to-last element of `nums`.

Let's denote the second-to-last element of `nums` as `second_last`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `second_last`.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is the new list of integers read from input and must have at least 1 element, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `i` is the second-to-last element of `nums`**
