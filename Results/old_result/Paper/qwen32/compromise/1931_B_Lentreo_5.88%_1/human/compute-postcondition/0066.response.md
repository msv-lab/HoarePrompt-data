Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the sum of the differences between each non-zero element and the last element of the list is zero. If this condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**
