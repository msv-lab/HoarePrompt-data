Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers from the input, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `curr` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in nums:
    if i != 0:
        curr += i - last


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `last` is the last element of `nums`, and if `i` is not 0, `curr` is updated to `curr + i - last`. If `i` is 0, `curr` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `next_i`. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `curr` is updated to `curr + (next_i - last)`. Otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is the next element in `nums` after `next_i`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `curr` is updated to `curr + (i - last)`; otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged. `last` remains the same in both cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
