The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This line of code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `nums`, `last`, `curr`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is a list of integers read from input, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `curr` is the sum of (i - last) for all i in nums except the last element, where i is not 0. If `curr` is 0, then no further changes are made to `curr`. Otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged and is not equal to 0.**
