The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The variables `t`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `curr` are described in the initial state, but they do not affect the output of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of these variables and simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Variable Initialization:**
   - `t` is an integer read from input such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is another integer read from input.
   - `nums` is a list of integers read from input.
   - `last` is the last element of the list `nums`.
   - `curr` is the sum of \((i - \text{last})\) for all non-zero elements `i` in `nums`, and it is not equal to 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement is `print('NO')`.
   - This statement outputs the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `curr`.

Since the `print` statement is fixed and does not depend on any variable values, the output will always be the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
