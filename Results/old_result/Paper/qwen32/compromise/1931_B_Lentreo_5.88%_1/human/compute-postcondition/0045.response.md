The code snippet provided reads a line of input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the line into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `nums`. The variables `_` and `t` are not affected by this code snippet. The variable `n`, which was an input integer, remains unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers from the input.**
