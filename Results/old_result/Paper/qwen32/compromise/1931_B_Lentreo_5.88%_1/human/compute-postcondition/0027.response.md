To ensure that the for loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over `nums`, so we need to ensure that `nums` is not empty. The variables `t`, `n`, `last`, and `curr` are not directly related to the execution of the loop, so we do not need to adjust them for the loop to execute.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Head Analysis**: The loop is `for i in nums:`. This means the loop will iterate over each element in the list `nums`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if and only if `nums` is not empty. If `nums` is empty, the loop will not execute at all.
3. **Adjustments Needed**: To ensure the loop executes, we need to ensure that `nums` contains at least one element.

Given this analysis, the state before the loop should be adjusted to ensure `nums` is not empty. We do not need to adjust `t`, `n`, `last`, or `curr` for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is the new list of integers read from input and must have at least 1 element, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `curr` is 0**
