Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 10^9 for each test case; the sum of `a_i` for each test case is divisible by `n`; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    last = nums[-1]
    curr = 0
    for i in nums:
        if i != 0:
            curr += i - last
    if curr == 0:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers read from input, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `curr` is the sum of (i - last) for all i in nums except the last element, where i is not 0. If `curr` is 0, then no further changes are made to `curr`. Otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged and is not equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is the new list of integers read from input, `last` is the last element of `nums`, and `curr` is the sum of (i - last) for all non-zero elements `i` in `nums`. If `curr` is 0, the current value of `curr` remains 0. Otherwise, `curr` is not equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is incremented by the length of `nums`, `t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `nums` remains the same, `last` remains the same, and `curr` is the sum of `(i - last)` for all `i` in `nums` where `i != 0`. If `curr` is 0, no additional changes occur. Otherwise, `curr` is not equal to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
