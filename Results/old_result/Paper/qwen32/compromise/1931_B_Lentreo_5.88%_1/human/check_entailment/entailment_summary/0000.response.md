Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The logic in the program is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the process of pouring water from one container to another.

The key point in the problem is to determine if we can redistribute the water such that each container has the same amount, which is the total sum of water divided by the number of containers. The provided program does not check if the cumulative water balance (after considering the required final amount in each container) is maintained correctly throughout the list.

Here's a breakdown of what the program does and why it's incorrect:

1. The program calculates the difference between each element and the last element (`last = nums[-1]`), and sums up these differences for non-zero elements.
2. It checks if this cumulative difference (`curr`) is zero.

However, this approach doesn't correctly simulate the process of water redistribution. The correct approach should involve checking if, at each step, we can pour water from a container with more water to a container with less water, ensuring that we can eventually balance the water in all containers.

The correct solution involves:
- Calculating the target amount of water each container should have, which is the total sum of water divided by the number of containers.
- Checking if, at each step, we can pour water from a container to the next one to reach the target amount, ensuring that we can balance the water in all containers.

Given the execution summary and the logic in the provided program, the program does not follow the correct approach to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
