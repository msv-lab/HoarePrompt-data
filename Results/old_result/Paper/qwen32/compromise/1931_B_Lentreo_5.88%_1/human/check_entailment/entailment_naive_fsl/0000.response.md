Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The logic in the program is flawed and does not correctly account for the conditions specified in the problem description.

Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.
3. It then calculates `last` as the last element in the list `nums`.
4. It initializes `curr` to 0 and iterates through the list `nums`. For each element `i` that is not 0, it adds `i - last` to `curr`.
5. Finally, it checks if `curr` is 0. If it is, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

The logic in the program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine if the water can be distributed equally among the containers. The program does not consider the cumulative sum of the water in the containers and whether it can be redistributed to make all containers have the same amount of water.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if we can redistribute the water such that all containers have the same amount. This can be done by checking if the prefix sums of the containers can be adjusted to make all containers have the average amount of water.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total_sum = sum(nums)
        target = total_sum // n  # Since the sum is divisible by n, this is the target amount for each container
        current_sum = 0
        can_distribute = True
        
        for num in nums:
            current_sum += num
            if current_sum > target * (nums.index(num) + 1):
                can_distribute = False
                break
        
        if can_distribute:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

In the corrected version, we calculate the target amount of water each container should have (`target`). We then iterate through the list of water amounts, maintaining a cumulative sum (`current_sum`). If at any point the cumulative sum exceeds the expected sum for the number of containers processed so far, it means we cannot redistribute the water to make all containers have the target amount, and we print "NO". Otherwise, we print "YES".

Given the original program does not correctly implement this logic, the correctness of the original program is **False**.
