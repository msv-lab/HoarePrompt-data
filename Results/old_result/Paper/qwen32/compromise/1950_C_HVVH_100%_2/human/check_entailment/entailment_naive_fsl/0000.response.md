Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not handle the case when the hour is exactly 12 PM correctly. Specifically, the code sets `day` to 'PM' when `h == 12`, but it also sets `day` to 'AM' when `h == 12` in the `else` block, which is incorrect.

Here is a specific test case that demonstrates the issue:
- Input: `12:00`
- Expected Output: `12:00 PM`
- Actual Output: `12:00 AM` (due to the incorrect handling of `h == 12`)

The correct handling should be:
- If `h == 0`, set `h = 12` and `day = 'AM'`.
- If `h == 12`, set `day = 'PM'`.
- If `h > 12`, set `h = h - 12` and `day = 'PM'`.
- If `0 < h < 12`, set `day = 'AM'`.

Here is the corrected code:
```python
def func():
    day = 'AM'
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

This corrected code ensures that `12:00` is correctly converted to `12:00 PM` and other edge cases are handled properly.
