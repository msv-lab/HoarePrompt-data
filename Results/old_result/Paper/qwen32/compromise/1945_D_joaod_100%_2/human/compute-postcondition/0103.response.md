To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. The loop is defined as:

```python
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop variable `v` will iterate from `na_frente` down to `-1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means the loop will execute if `na_frente` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `v` is -1
- `total` is 0
- `best` is a very large positive float (`sys.float_info.max`)
- `c` is 9
- `na_frente` is `na_frente - 1`
- `pos_final` is `pos_final - 1`
- `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers provided by the input
- `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers provided by the input

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `na_frente`. For the loop to execute at least once, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to `-1`. Given that `na_frente` is currently `na_frente - 1`, we need to ensure that the initial value of `na_frente` is at least `0` so that `na_frente - 1` is at least `-1`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `na_frente` is at least `0` before the loop starts.

State: **`v` is -1, `total` is 0, `best` is a very large positive float (`sys.float_info.max`), `c` is 9, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is `pos_final - 1`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers provided by the input**
