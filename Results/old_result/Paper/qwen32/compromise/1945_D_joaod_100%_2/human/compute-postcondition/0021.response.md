Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200,000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^9, the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer read from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input, `total` is `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` is `sys.float_info.max`, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. Additionally, the cost to change at position `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) is less than the cost to pass at position `v` (`custo_pra_passar_b[v]`).**

Natural Language: The `total` has been updated to the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
