To determine the output of the `print(best)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and identify the value of the `best` variable.

From the initial state:
- `v` is -1.
- `total` is the sum of the smallest costs chosen at each step.
- `best` is the minimum cost found during the loop.
- `c` is 9.
- `na_frente` is `na_frente - 1`.
- `pos_final` is `pos_final - 1`.
- `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers provided by the input.
- `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers provided by the input.

The key variable here is `best`, which is described as "the minimum cost found during the loop." However, the initial state does not provide any specific value for `best` or any details about the loop that would determine its value. Therefore, the most precise description we can provide is that `best` is the minimum cost found during the loop.

Since there's no additional information to determine the exact numerical value of `best`, we will describe it in terms of its definition.

Output: **best (where best is the minimum cost found during the loop)**
