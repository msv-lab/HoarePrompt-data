Output State: **`v` is `na_frente - 1`, `total` is updated to the previous `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` is the minimum between `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `c` is 9, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is `pos_final - 1`, and `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers provided by the input.**

In simpler terms, the value of `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The value of `best` is recalculated as the minimum between the new `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and the new `total` plus `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
