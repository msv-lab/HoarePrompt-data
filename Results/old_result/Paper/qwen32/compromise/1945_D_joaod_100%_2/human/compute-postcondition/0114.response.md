Postcondition: **`v` is -1, `total` is 0, `best` is a very large positive float (`sys.float_info.max`), `c` is 9, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is `pos_final - 1`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers provided by the input, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. Additionally, the cost at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a` is less than the cost at index `v` in `custo_pra_passar_b`.**
