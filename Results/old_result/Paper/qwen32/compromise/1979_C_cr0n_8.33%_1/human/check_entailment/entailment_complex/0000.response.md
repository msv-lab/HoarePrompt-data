### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem by calculating the bets for each outcome in such a way that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.

2. **Calculating the Product:**
   - It calculates the product `prod` of all multipliers `k_i`. This product represents the total product of all multipliers for the current test case.

3. **Calculating `vprod`:**
   - For each multiplier `k_i`, it calculates `prod // k_i` and stores these values in the list `vprod`. This essentially calculates the contribution of each multiplier to the total product when it is excluded.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - It calculates `den` as `prod - sum(vprod)`. If `den` is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1`, indicating that it's not possible to find a valid distribution of bets that satisfies the conditions. This is because `den` represents the difference between the total product and the sum of contributions, which should be positive for a valid solution to exist.

5. **Printing the Result:**
   - If `den` is greater than zero, it prints the values in `vprod` as the bets for each outcome. This is because `vprod` contains the values that, when summed, are less than the product `prod` and satisfy the condition that the total bet is less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.

### Verification:

Let's verify the logic with one of the examples provided:

- **Example:**
  - Input:
    ```
    3
    3
    3 2 7
    2
    3 3
    5
    5 5 5 5 5
    ```
  - For the first test case:
    - `prod = 3 * 2 * 7 = 42`
    - `vprod = [42 // 3, 42 // 2, 42 // 7] = [14, 21, 6]`
    - `den = 42 - (14 + 21 + 6) = 42 - 41 = 1 > 0`
    - Output: `14 21 6` (Note: The example given in the problem is `27 41 12`, which is also a valid solution, but the logic of the program is correct)

- **Second Test Case:**
  - `prod = 3 * 3 = 9`
  - `vprod = [9 // 3, 9 // 3] = [3, 3]`
  - `den = 9 - (3 + 3) = 9 - 6 = 3 > 0`
  - Output: `3 3` (Note: The example given in the problem is `1 1`, which is also a valid solution, but the logic of the program is correct)

- **Third Test Case:**
  - `prod = 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 3125`
  - `vprod = [3125 // 5, 3125 // 5, 3125 // 5, 3125 // 5, 3125 // 5] = [625, 625, 625, 625, 625]`
  - `den = 3125 - (625 + 625 + 625 + 625 + 625) = 3125 - 3125 = 0`
  - Output: `-1` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a valid distribution of bets exists and outputs the correct bets if a solution is possible. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
