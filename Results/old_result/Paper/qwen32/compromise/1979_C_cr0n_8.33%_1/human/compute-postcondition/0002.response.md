The code snippet `prod = 1` initializes the variable `prod` to 1. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 50, and a list of integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n where 2 <= k_i <= 20 for each i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `N` is the integer value read from input; `vals` is a list of integers read from the input; `prod` is 1.**
