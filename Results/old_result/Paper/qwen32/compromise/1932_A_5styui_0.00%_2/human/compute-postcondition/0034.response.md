Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `path` is a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '@', and '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.'; `a` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `d` is an input integer; `b` is an input value that must have at least 1 element; `j` is 2. If `b[j]` is '@', `s` is set to 2. If `b[j]` is '*', `s` is set to 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `s` is set to 1.**
