Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `path` is a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '@', and '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.', `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is `j + 1`. If `b[j]` is '@', then `s` is `s + 1`. If `b[j]` is '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `b[j + 1]` is '*' or if the `if b[:]` condition is met. If `b[j]` is neither '@' nor '*', `s` is determined based on `b[j + 1]`.**
