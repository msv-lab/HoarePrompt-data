The code snippet provided increments the variable `s` by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `path` is a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '@', and '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.', `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is `j + 1`, `s` is `s + 1`**.
