Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', and '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.'; `a` is greater than 0; `i` is 2; `d` is an input integer; `b` is a non-empty string; `j` is 4. If `b[j]` is '@', then `s` is 2; otherwise, `s` is 0. The loop breaks.**

Explanation: The `break` statement exits the loop, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the initial conditions and variable states remain unchanged except for the fact that the loop breaks.
