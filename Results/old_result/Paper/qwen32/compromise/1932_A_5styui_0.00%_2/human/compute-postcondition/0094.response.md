The `break` statement will terminate the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of the variables do not change due to the `break` statement itself.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', and '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.'; `a` is greater than 0; `i` is 2; `d` is an input integer; `b` is a non-empty string; `j` is 3; if `b[j]` is '@', then `s` is 1; otherwise, `s` is 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
