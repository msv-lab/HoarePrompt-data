Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses the `random.sample` function to shuffle the string `s` into `s2`. While this approach may work for some cases, it is not guaranteed to produce a different string `s2` from `s` for every input. Specifically, if the input string `s` consists of all identical characters (e.g., "aaaaa"), then any permutation of `s` will be the same as `s` itself. In such cases, the program will incorrectly report "NO" because `s` and `s2` will be the same.

For example, consider the input "aaaaa". The program might generate "aaaaa" again as `s2`, leading to an incorrect output of "NO" instead of "YES" with a different permutation. This violates the problem description, which requires that if a rearrangement exists, the program should output "YES" and the rearranged string.

Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
