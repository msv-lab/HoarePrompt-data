### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to read multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (which is the length of the string `s`), then reads the string `s` itself. It counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" within the string `s` and prints the sum of these counts.

The task, however, requires determining the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful (i.e., not containing the substrings "map" or "pie"). Simply counting the occurrences of "map" and "pie" does not provide the minimum number of characters to remove; it only gives the number of times these substrings appear.

To solve the problem correctly, we should find a way to remove the minimum number of characters such that neither "map" nor "pie" appears in the string. This is a more complex problem that involves dynamic programming or greedy algorithms, not just counting substrings.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It merely counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" and does not determine the minimum number of characters to remove.

**Correctness: False**
