The code snippet `cnt -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, `cnt` was `initial cnt - 2`. After decrementing, `cnt` becomes `(initial cnt - 2) - 1`, which simplifies to `initial cnt - 3`.

The other variables (`l`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`cnt` is `initial cnt - 3`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than `func_2()`**.
