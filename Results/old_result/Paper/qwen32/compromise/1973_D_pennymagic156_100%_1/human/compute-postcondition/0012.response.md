The value of `v` is updated to be equal to the value of `i`. Since `i` is initially set to `n - 1`, the new value of `v` will be `n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\); `i` is \(n - 1\); `v` is \(n - 1\)**.
