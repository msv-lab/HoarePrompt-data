The code reassigns the variable `l` to the value of `func_2() + 1`. Since `l` was initially defined as `func_2() + 1`, reassigning it does not change its value. Therefore, the only variable that could potentially be affected is `l`, but since it is reassigned to the same expression, there is no change in its value.

Output State: **`cnt` is `initial cnt - 2` where `initial cnt` is at least 3, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than `func_2()`**.
