To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's carefully analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `cnt` is `0`.
- `l` is the value of `func_2() + 1` from the last iteration before the loop terminates.
- `cnt` equals `0` and `l` equals `n + 1`.

However, the `print` statement involves two variables `i` and `v` which are not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. Since these variables are not defined in the given initial state, we need to infer their possible values based on common programming practices and the context provided.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'! {i * v}', flush=True)
```
This statement prints a formatted string that includes the product of `i` and `v`, prefixed with an exclamation mark.

### Determining Values of `i` and `v`:
Given that `i` and `v` are not defined in the initial state, we must consider the following possibilities:
1. **Loop Context**: If this `print` statement is inside a loop, `i` could be a loop counter and `v` could be a value being processed in each iteration.
2. **Function Arguments**: If this `print` statement is within a function, `i` and `v` might be passed as arguments to that function.

Without additional context about the loop or function, we can only assume that `i` and `v` are defined somewhere in the code preceding the `print` statement. Since their specific values are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical result of `i * v`.

### Conclusion:
Based on the given information, the output will be a formatted string showing the product of `i` and `v`, prefixed with an exclamation mark. We cannot determine the exact numerical value of `i * v` without more details.

### Final Output:
Output: **! [i * v] (where i and v are variables defined elsewhere in the code)**
