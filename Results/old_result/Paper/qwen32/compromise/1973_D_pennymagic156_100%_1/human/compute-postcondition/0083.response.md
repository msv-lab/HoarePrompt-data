The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a specific string followed by flushing the output buffer:

```python
print('! -1', flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` function in Python outputs the specified string to the console.
- The string to be printed is `'! -1'`.
- The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is immediately flushed to the console, but it does not affect the content of the output.

### Variables:
- `i` is defined as `n // k + 1`, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `cnt` and `l` are mentioned as the last values from the previous iteration, but they are also not used in the print statement.

### Output:
Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'! -1'` and does not reference any of the variables `i`, `cnt`, or `l`, the output will simply be the string `'! -1'`.

Output: **! -1**
