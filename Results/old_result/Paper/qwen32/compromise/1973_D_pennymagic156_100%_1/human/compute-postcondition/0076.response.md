To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop terminates. The loop continues as long as `cnt` is non-zero and `l` is less than `n + 1`. Given the pattern from the first three iterations, we can infer that `l` is updated to `func_2() + 1` in each iteration, and `cnt` is decremented by 1 in each iteration.

The loop will terminate when either `cnt` becomes zero or `l` becomes equal to `n + 1`. Since `cnt` starts at `k` and is decremented by 1 in each iteration, the loop will run a maximum of `k` times unless `l` reaches `n + 1` before `cnt` reaches zero.

Let's denote the number of iterations the loop actually runs as `m`, where `m` is the minimum of `k` and the number of times `l` can be incremented to be less than `n + 1`.

After `m` iterations:
- `cnt` will be `k - m`.
- `l` will be `func_2() + 1` from the last iteration, but since `l` is updated in each iteration, the final value of `l` will depend on the specific values returned by `func_2()` in each iteration. However, we know that `l` will be such that it either equals `n + 1` or the loop has terminated because `cnt` reached zero.
- `i` remains unchanged throughout the loop and is still `1`.

Therefore, the final output state can be described as follows:

If `m = k` (i.e., `cnt` reaches zero before `l` reaches `n + 1`):
- `cnt` is `0`.
- `l` is the value of `func_2() + 1` from the last iteration, which could be any value depending on `func_2()`, but it is guaranteed to be less than `n + 1` because the loop would have terminated if `l` had reached `n + 1`.
- `i` is `1`.

If `m < k` (i.e., `l` reaches `n + 1` before `cnt` reaches zero):
- `cnt` is `k - m`.
- `l` is `n + 1`.
- `i` is `1`.

Since we do not have specific information about the behavior of `func_2()`, we can only provide a general description based on the conditions given. The most definitive part of the final state is that `cnt` will be `0` if the loop runs `k` times, or `k - m` if it runs fewer times due to `l` reaching `n + 1`.

Given the problem constraints and the information provided, the most precise and general final output state we can describe is:

Output State: **`cnt` is `0` if `k` iterations occur, otherwise `cnt` is `k - m` where `m` is the number of iterations before `l` reaches `n + 1`; `l` is `n + 1` if the loop terminates due to `l` reaching `n + 1`, otherwise `l` is the value of `func_2() + 1` from the last iteration; `i` is `1`.**
