The only variable in the loop head is `i`, as it is the only variable that changes with each iteration of the loop. The loop iterates from `n` down to `1`, decrementing `i` by `1` in each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to decrement `i` by `1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n - 1`.
- The loop decrements `i` by `1` at the start of each new iteration.
- Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `(n - 1) - 1`, which simplifies to `n - 2`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `v`) remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\); `i` is \(n - 2\); `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`**.
