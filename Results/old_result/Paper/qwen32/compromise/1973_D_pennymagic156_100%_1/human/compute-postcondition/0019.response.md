Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\); `i` is \(n - 2\); `v` is \(n - 2\) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `i`, and `v` remain unchanged. We simply break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
