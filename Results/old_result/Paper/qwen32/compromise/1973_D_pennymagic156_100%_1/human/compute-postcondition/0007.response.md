Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\); `v` is now equal to `i`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are the values returned by `func_3()`. The variable `v` is set to the value of `i`. No other changes occur, and we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
