Output State: **`cnt` is `k`, `l` is `1`, `i` is `1`; either `cnt` is not `0` or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`**

Explanation: The values of `cnt` and `l` have been updated to `k` and `1` respectively. The value of `i` remains unchanged. The condition that either `cnt` is not `0` or `l` is not equal to `n + 1` still holds true since `l` is now `1`.
