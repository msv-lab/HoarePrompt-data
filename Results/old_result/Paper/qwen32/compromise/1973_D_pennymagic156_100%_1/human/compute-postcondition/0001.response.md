Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\); `v` is 1.**

Natural Language: The values of `n` and `k` remain the same as they were initially, being positive integers with the condition \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\). The variable `v` is set to 1.
