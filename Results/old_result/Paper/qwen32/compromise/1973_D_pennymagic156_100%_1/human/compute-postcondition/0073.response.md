Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`cnt`**: This is defined as `initial cnt - 2`, where `initial cnt` is at least 3. However, this variable is not used in the print statement, so we don't need to consider its value further.

2. **`l`**: This is defined as `func_2() + 1`. Since `func_2()` is a function call, we don't have the specific implementation or return value of `func_2()`. Therefore, `l` is `func_2() + 1`.

3. **`i`**: This is explicitly set to 1.

4. **`n`**: This must be greater than `func_2()`. Again, since `func_2()` is not specified, we don't know the exact value of `n`, but it is irrelevant to the print statement.

5. **`v`**: This variable is used in the print statement (`i * v`), but it is not defined in the initial state. We need to assume that `v` has some value, but since it's not provided, we'll represent it as `v`.

### Print Statement Analysis:

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

- **`?`**: This is a literal character in the string.
- **`{l}`**: This will be replaced by the value of `l`, which is `func_2() + 1`.
- **`{i * v}`**: This will be replaced by the product of `i` and `v`. Since `i` is 1, this simplifies to just `v`.

### Final Output Description:

Given the above analysis, the print statement will output a string starting with `?`, followed by the value of `l` (which is `func_2() + 1`), and then the value of `v`.

Output: **? func_2() + 1 v (where func_2() + 1 is the value of l and v is the value of v)**
