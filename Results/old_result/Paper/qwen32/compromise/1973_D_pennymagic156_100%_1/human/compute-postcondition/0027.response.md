The code snippet `cnt -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt` by 1. Given that the initial state specifies `cnt` is `k`, after the decrement, `cnt` will be `k - 1`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `i`, `v`, `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that `n >= k` and `n` is at least 0, `i` is 1, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration, `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `v + 1`.**
