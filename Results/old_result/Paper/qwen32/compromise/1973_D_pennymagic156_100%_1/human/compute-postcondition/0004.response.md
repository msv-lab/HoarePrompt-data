Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\); `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`**.

This means that the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they were initially set by `func_3()`. The variable `v` is now updated to hold the value returned by `func_2()`.
