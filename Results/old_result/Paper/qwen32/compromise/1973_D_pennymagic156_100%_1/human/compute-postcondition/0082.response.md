To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given conditions.

The loop iterates over `i` from `1` to `n // k`. For each iteration of `i`, it performs a nested loop (`while` loop) that runs up to `k` times (or until `l` reaches `n + 1`). The variable `cnt` keeps track of how many times the inner loop can run, decrementing by `1` each time. The variable `l` is updated based on the value returned by `func_2()` plus `1`.

Here's a breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. The outer loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n // k`.
2. For each `i`, the inner loop runs up to `k` times, printing a query and updating `l` and `cnt`.
3. If `cnt` reaches `0` and `l` reaches `n + 1`, it prints the answer and exits the function.
4. Otherwise, it continues with the next iteration of the outer loop.

From the provided output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that the loop continues until either `cnt` reaches `0` and `l` reaches `n + 1` or the outer loop completes all its iterations.

Given that the loop continues until either condition is met, the final state will be when the outer loop has completed all its iterations (`i` has reached `n // k + 1`), or the loop has printed the answer and exited early.

Since the problem does not specify that the loop exits early, we assume it completes all iterations unless `cnt` reaches `0` and `l` reaches `n + 1` during any iteration.

Therefore, the final output state is when the outer loop completes all its iterations, meaning `i` will be `n // k + 1`. At this point, `cnt` could be any value (since the loop may have exited early if `cnt` reached `0` and `l` reached `n + 1`), but since we are considering the completion of all iterations, we assume `cnt` is not necessarily `0` and `l` is not necessarily `n + 1` unless the loop exited early.

However, since the problem specifies the state after all iterations, and the loop does not exit early in the provided states, we consider the final state as follows:

- `i` will be `n // k + 1` (indicating the loop has completed all iterations).
- `cnt` and `l` will be in their last updated states from the last iteration of the loop.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `n // k + 1`, `cnt` is the last value of `cnt` from the last iteration, and `l` is the last value of `l` from the last iteration.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `i` will be one more than the maximum number of times the outer loop ran, and `cnt` and `l` will reflect the state from the last iteration of the loop.
