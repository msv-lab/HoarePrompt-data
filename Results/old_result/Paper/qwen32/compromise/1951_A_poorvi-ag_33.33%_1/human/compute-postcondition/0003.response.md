To determine the output state after the loop has executed, we need to understand the logic of the loop and how it modifies the `results` list based on the input values.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's logic:

1. The loop runs `t` times.
2. In each iteration, it reads an integer `n` and a string `arr`.
3. It checks if the count of '1's in `arr` is 2 and if '11' is a substring of `arr`. If both conditions are true, it appends 'no' to the `results` list.
4. If the count of '1's in `arr` is even, it performs another check:
   - If the count of '1's is 2 and '11' is a substring of `arr`, it appends 'no' to the `results` list.
   - Otherwise, it appends 'yes' to the `results` list.
5. If the count of '1's in `arr` is odd, it appends 'no' to the `results` list.

The `start` and `end` variables are not used within the loop, so they remain unchanged.

Given the initial state and the loop's logic, the output state will be defined by the `results` list after all iterations. The `results` list will contain a series of 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions checked in each iteration.

Output State: **results is a list of 'yes' or 'no' based on the input conditions after t iterations.**
