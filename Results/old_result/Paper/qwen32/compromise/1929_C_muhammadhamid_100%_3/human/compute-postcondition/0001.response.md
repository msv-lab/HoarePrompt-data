The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a`. The initial state only specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000. Since `k`, `x`, and `a` are assigned new values from the input, the output state will reflect these new assignments. The variable `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `k` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input; `a` is the third integer from the input.**
