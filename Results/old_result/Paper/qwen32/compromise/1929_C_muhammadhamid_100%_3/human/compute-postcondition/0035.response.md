Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000), representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives three integers: `k` (2 <= k <= 30), `x` (1 <= x <= 100), and `a` (1 <= a <= 10^9). For each test case, it returns a value based on the given constraints, though the specific return value is not detailed in the output description provided.**
