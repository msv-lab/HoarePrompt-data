Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. 

1. **Function `func_2` does not pass `a` and `ops` to `recursive_maximize_sum` correctly:**
   ```python
   def func_2(a):
       n = len(a)
       ops = []

       recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)  # 'a' and 'ops' are not passed here
       return (sum(a), len(ops), ops)
   ```
   The `recursive_maximize_sum` function should receive `a` and `ops` as parameters, but they are not being passed. This will result in a `NameError` as `a` and `ops` are not defined within the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.

2. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined correctly:**
   ```python
   def recursive_maximize_sum(l, r):
       s = sum(a[l:r + 1])
       if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1):
           func_1(a, l, r, ops)
           ops.append((l, r))
           for i in range(l, r + 1):
               a[i] = r - l + 1
       else:
           mx = max(a[l:r + 1])
           pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l
           if pos != l:
               recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)
           if pos != r:
               recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)
   ```
   The `recursive_maximize_sum` function is supposed to maximize the sum of the array `a` within the range `[l, r]` using the operations described. However, it does not properly handle the `ops` list, which is not passed as a parameter. Additionally, the logic for determining when to apply `func_1` and when to recursively split the array seems flawed.

3. **Function `func_1` has incorrect logic:**
   ```python
   def func_1(a, l, r, ops):
       if l == r:
           if a[l] != 0:
               ops.append((l, l))
               a[l] = 0
           return
       func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)
       if a[l] != r - l + 1:
           ops.append((l, r))
           for i in range(l, r + 1):
               a[i] = r - l + 1
           func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)
   ```
   The `func_1` function is supposed to set the values in the range `[l, r]` to the MEX of the range. However, the logic for setting the values and the recursive calls seems incorrect. Specifically, setting `a[l] = 0` when `l == r` and `a[l] != 0` does not align with the goal of maximizing the sum. Additionally, the recursive calls and the logic for setting the values to `r - l + 1` are not correctly implemented to achieve the desired result.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. There are multiple cases where the program will not produce the expected output. For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The program may not correctly identify the operations needed to maximize the sum to `105` as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
