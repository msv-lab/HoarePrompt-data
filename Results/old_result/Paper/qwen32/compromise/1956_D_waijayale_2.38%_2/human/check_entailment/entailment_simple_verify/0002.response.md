### Reasoning:

Let's carefully evaluate the provided Python program against the problem description and use the annotated version to systematically validate or challenge the original assessment.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function is supposed to handle the subarray from `l` to `r` by recursively setting elements to the MEX value if necessary.
   - **Behavior**:
     - If `l == r`, it checks if `a[l]` is non-zero and sets it to zero if true, appending the operation to `ops`.
     - Otherwise, it recursively processes the subarray from `l+1` to `r`.
     - After the recursive call, if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`, it sets all elements from `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1` and appends the operation to `ops`.
   - **Annotations**: The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function calls, indicating that the function is attempting to maximize the MEX value of the subarray by setting it to `r - l + 1` if necessary.
   - **Issue**: The logic seems flawed because setting all elements to `r - l + 1` does not necessarily maximize the sum of the array. It could be more beneficial to set elements to higher values if possible.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)`.
   - **Behavior**:
     - It initializes `ops` as an empty list.
     - It calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)` to process the entire array.
     - It returns the sum of the array `a`, the number of operations, and the operations list.
   - **Annotations**: The annotations incorrectly state that `ops` is empty when it is returned, which is not true based on the logic in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum`.
   - **Issue**: The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined within `func_2`, leading to a `NameError`.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function is supposed to partition the array around the maximum value and recursively maximize the sum in each partition.
   - **Behavior**:
     - It calculates the sum `s` of the subarray from `l` to `r`.
     - If `s` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, it calls `func_1` and sets the entire subarray to `r - l + 1`.
     - Otherwise, it finds the maximum value `mx` in the subarray and its position `pos`. It then recursively calls itself on the subarrays to the left and right of `pos`.
   - **Annotations**: The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function calls, indicating that the function is attempting to maximize the sum by partitioning the array around the maximum value.
   - **Issue**: The logic seems flawed because the condition `s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` does not necessarily imply that setting the subarray to `r - l + 1` is optimal. Additionally, the function is not defined within `func_2`.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function reads the input, calls `func_2` with the array `a`, and prints the sum and the operations.
   - **Behavior**:
     - It reads the input values for `n` and `a`.
     - It calls `func_2` to get the sum, number of operations, and operations list.
     - It prints the sum and the operations, converting from 0-based to 1-based indexing.
   - **Annotations**: The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function calls, indicating that the function is correctly reading input and printing the output.
   - **Issue**: The function is dependent on `func_2`, which is incorrect due to the undefined `recursive_maximize_sum` function.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to:
- Undefined function `recursive_maximize_sum`.
- Flawed logic in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` that does not necessarily maximize the sum of the array.
- Incorrect annotations for `func_2` stating that `ops` is empty when it is returned.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
