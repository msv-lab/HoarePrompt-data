### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided Python program and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: To handle the case when `l == r` and when `a[l] != 0`, setting `a[l]` to `0` and adding the operation to `ops`. It also recursively calls itself to handle the subarray from `l+1` to `r`.
- **Annotations**: The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function call. The function sets `a[l]` to `0` if `a[l]` is not `0` and appends the operation `(l, l)` to `ops`. Then, it recursively processes the subarray from `l+1` to `r`. If `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`, it sets the entire subarray from `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1` and appends the operation `(l, r)` to `ops`.
- **Issues**: The function seems to be trying to maximize the MEX value of the subarray, but the logic might not be optimal for the overall sum of the array. The annotations correctly describe the behavior of the function, but the logic itself might not be correct.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: To initialize the operations list `ops` and call `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)`.
- **Annotations**: The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function call. However, the function calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)`, but `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined within this function. The function returns the sum of the array `a`, the length of the operations list `ops`, and the operations list `ops` itself.
- **Issues**: The function is incorrect because `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined within `func_2`.

#### Function `recursive_maximize_sum`:
- **Purpose**: To calculate the sum `s` of the subarray from `l` to `r`. It checks if `s` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, and if so, it calls `func_1` and sets the entire subarray to `r - l + 1`. Otherwise, it finds the maximum value `mx` in the subarray and its position `pos`. It then recursively calls itself on the subarrays to the left and right of `pos`.
- **Annotations**: The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function call. The function calculates the sum `s` of the subarray from `l` to `r` and checks if `s` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. If so, it calls `func_1` and sets the entire subarray to `r - l + 1`. Otherwise, it finds the maximum value `mx` in the subarray and its position `pos` and recursively calls itself on the subarrays to the left and right of `pos`.
- **Issues**: The logic in `recursive_maximize_sum` seems flawed. The condition `s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` does not necessarily imply that setting the subarray to `r - l + 1` is optimal. The annotations correctly describe the behavior of the function, but the logic itself might not be correct.

#### Function `func_3`:
- **Purpose**: To read the input, call `func_2` with the array `a`, and print the sum and the operations.
- **Annotations**: The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function call. The function reads the input, calls `func_2` with the array `a`, and prints the sum and the operations. It correctly formats the output by adding 1 to `l` and `r` to convert from 0-based to 1-based indexing.
- **Issues**: The function is correct in terms of reading input, calling `func_2`, and printing the output.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to undefined functions, flawed logic, and potential inefficiency in the number of operations. The annotations correctly describe the behavior of the functions, but the logic itself is flawed.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
