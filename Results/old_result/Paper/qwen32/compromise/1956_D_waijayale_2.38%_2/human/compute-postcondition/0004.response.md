To ensure that the for loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which in this case is `ops`. The loop will iterate over each tuple `(l, r)` in `ops`, so `ops` must be a list containing at least one tuple.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `ops`, which should be a list of tuples.

2. **Determine the Requirement for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `ops` must contain at least one tuple.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - We need to ensure that `ops` is a list with at least one tuple. The values of `a`, `n`, `s`, and `m` do not directly affect whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Given this, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `n` is the integer value provided as input, `s` is the first return value of `func_2(a)`, `m` is the second return value of `func_2(a)`, `ops` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, e.g., `ops` is `[(l, r)]` where `l` and `r` are integers**.

To make it more concrete, let's assume `ops` contains at least one tuple `(0, 1)`:

State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `n` is the integer value provided as input, `s` is the first return value of `func_2(a)`, `m` is the second return value of `func_2(a)`, `ops` is `[(0, 1)]`**.
