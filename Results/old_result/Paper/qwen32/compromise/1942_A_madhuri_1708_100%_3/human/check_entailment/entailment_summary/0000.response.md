Let's examine the program's logic in the context of the problem's requirements.

1. **When `k < 2`:**
   - The program outputs a sequence from `1` to `n`. 
   - This ensures that there is only one sorted cyclic shift, which is the sequence itself. This meets the requirement for `k = 1`.

2. **When `k ≥ 2` and `n == k`:**
   - The program outputs an array with `k` repeated `k` times.
   - All cyclic shifts of this array are identical and sorted. Therefore, there are exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts, which meets the requirement.

3. **When `k ≥ 2` and `n ≠ k`:**
   - The program outputs `-1`.
   - This is because it is impossible to construct an array of length `n` with exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts if `n ≠ k`. For `k` sorted cyclic shifts, the array would need to be constructed in a very specific way that is only possible when `n == k`.

The program correctly handles all cases as per the problem statement and the execution summary. It ensures that the output meets the required conditions for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
