Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it outputs a sequence of `n` numbers. If `k < 2`, the sequence contains numbers from `1` to `n`. If `k ≥ 2` and `n == k`, the sequence contains `k` repeated `k` times. If `k ≥ 2` and `n ≠ k`, it outputs `-1`.**
