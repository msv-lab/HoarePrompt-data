Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly determines the maximum balance of the problemset by iterating through possible divisors of `x` and checking if they can be used to split `x` into `n` sub-problems. The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) implicitly by checking the divisors and their corresponding quotients. The logic is sound and the implementation is correct based on the problem description.
