You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)

    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):

            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
    #State: ans is the largest divisor of x that is greater than or equal to n or the largest quotient x // i that is greater than or equal to n.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x that is greater than or equal to n, or the largest quotient x // i that is greater than or equal to n)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find the maximum balance (the greatest common divisor, GCD) of a set of `n` sub-problems such that the sum of their difficulties equals `x`.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve this problem by iterating through all possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`. For each divisor `i`:
- It checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`. If true, it updates the `ans` with the maximum value between the current `ans` and `i`.
- It also checks if `n` is less than or equal to `i`. If true, it updates the `ans` with the maximum value between the current `ans` and `x // i`.

The program then prints the maximum balance `ans` found for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis
The program's logic is based on the observation that the balance of the problemset is a divisor of `x`. The goal is to find the largest divisor of `x` such that `n` sub-problems can be created with difficulties that sum up to `x`.

The key steps are:
1. **Iterate through divisors**: The program correctly iterates through all divisors of `x` up to `sqrt(x)`. This ensures that all possible divisors are considered.
2. **Check feasibility**: For each divisor `i`, it checks if `n` sub-problems can be created with difficulties that sum up to `x`. This is done by checking if `n <= x // i` or `n <= i`.
3. **Update maximum balance**: The program keeps track of the maximum divisor that satisfies the feasibility condition.

### Edge Cases
- **When `n == x`**: The only way to divide `x` into `n` sub-problems is to make each sub-problem have a difficulty of `1`. The balance in this case is `1`.
- **When `x` is a prime number**: The only divisors are `1` and `x`. If `n > 1`, the balance will be `1`. If `n == 1`, the balance will be `x`.
- **When `x` is a perfect square**: The program correctly handles this scenario by iterating up to `sqrt(x)`.

### Conclusion
The program correctly finds the maximum balance by iterating through all divisors of `x` and checking the feasibility of creating `n` sub-problems. It handles all edge cases appropriately.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
