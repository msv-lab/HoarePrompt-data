Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine if there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. The current implementation only checks if there is at least one position where the characters in a and b differ from the character in c. However, this does not ensure that a template t can be constructed to satisfy the conditions for all positions.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if for each position i from 1 to n, we can choose a template character that satisfies the conditions for strings a, b, and c. Specifically, for each position i:

- If a[i] == b[i], then the template character must be different from a[i] (and b[i]) to ensure c[i] does not match.
- If a[i] != b[i], then we can choose the template character to be either a uppercase version of a[i] or b[i] (ensuring it matches a and b but not c if c[i] is the same as a[i] or b[i]).

Here's a corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            # If a[i] == b[i], then the template character must be different from a[i] and b[i]
            if a[i] == c[i]:
                return 'NO'
        else:
            # If a[i] != b[i], then the template character can be either a[i] or b[i]
            # We need to ensure that c[i] does not match the chosen template character
            if c[i] == a[i] and c[i] == b[i]:
                return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

This corrected function checks the necessary conditions for each position i to determine if a valid template can be constructed.
