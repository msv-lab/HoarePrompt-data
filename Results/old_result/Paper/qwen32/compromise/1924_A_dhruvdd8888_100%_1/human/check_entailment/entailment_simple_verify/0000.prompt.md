You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly determine whether all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Subsequences**:
   - The program attempts to check for subsequences by maintaining a set `win` of characters encountered so far. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly handle the order of characters required for subsequences.
   - For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 2`, and `s = "abba"`, the program will not correctly identify that "ba" is a subsequence because it relies on the set `win` being filled with all characters in order, which is not the requirement for subsequences.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where the required subsequences are not present in `s`. For example, in the second test case (`n = 2`, `k = 2`, `s = "abb"`), the program should output "NO" and provide a string like "aa" that is not a subsequence, but the current logic might not produce the correct output.

3. **Generating the Missing Subsequence**:
   - The logic for generating a missing subsequence is also flawed. The program attempts to generate a string by appending characters from `us` that are not in `win`, but this does not guarantee that the generated string is a valid missing subsequence.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following input:
```
1
2 2 3
abb
```

The program should output:
```
NO
aa
```
However, the current logic might not correctly identify "aa" as a missing subsequence because it does not properly check for all possible subsequences of length `n`.

### Correct Approach:

A correct approach would involve generating all possible subsequences of length `n` and checking each one against the string `s` to see if it exists as a subsequence. This can be done using a backtracking approach or by using dynamic programming to efficiently check for subsequences.

Given the complexity and the constraints, a more efficient approach is needed, such as using a sliding window or dynamic programming to count the occurrences of each subsequence, but the provided code does not implement this correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
