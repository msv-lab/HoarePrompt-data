You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the n × n matrix filled with zeroes. The function should handle multiple test cases, with the total number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and the sum of n^2 over all test cases not exceeding 5 × 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
    #This is printed: n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n (where n is the integer input representing the size of the n × n matrix)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        
        print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        
    #State: The output consists of 2 * n lines, with each line being either "1 i n (n-1) ... 2 1" or "2 i n (n-1) ... 2 1" for i ranging from 1 to n.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It handles multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of an n × n matrix filled with zeroes. The function processes these test cases and returns the resulting matrices. For each test case, it returns an n × n matrix filled with zeroes.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
