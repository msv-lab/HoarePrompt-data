You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for t in range(t, 0, -1):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` representing the size of an n × n matrix and prints a specific sequence of lines. For each test case, it prints the value `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` followed by `2 * n`, and then outputs `2 * n` lines, each consisting of either "1 i n (n-1) ... 2 1" or "2 i n (n-1) ... 2 1" for i ranging from 1 to n.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the operations to maximize the sum of the matrix. Let's analyze why:

The program outputs the maximum possible sum of the matrix and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves. The maximum possible sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with the largest possible distinct integers from 1 to \( n \) is indeed \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \). However, the operations described in the program do not achieve this sum correctly.

The operations provided are:
1. For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), set the row \( i \) to the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
2. For each column \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), set the column \( i \) to the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

This approach does not ensure that the matrix is filled with the largest possible distinct integers in a way that maximizes the sum. Instead, it fills each row and column with the same decreasing sequence, which does not yield the maximum possible sum.

To maximize the sum, we need to ensure that each row and column contains distinct integers from 1 to \( n \) in such a way that the sum is maximized. One correct approach is to fill the matrix in a way that each row and each column contains the integers from 1 to \( n \) exactly once, ensuring that the sum of each row and each column is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).

A correct approach would be to fill the matrix with a Latin square, where each row and each column contains the integers from 1 to \( n \) exactly once. For example, for \( n = 2 \), a correct matrix would be:
```
1 2
2 1
```
This matrix has a sum of \( 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6 \), which is incorrect for \( n = 2 \). The correct sum for \( n = 2 \) is 7, achieved by the following matrix:
```
1 2
2 3
```
However, the program does not generate such a matrix. Instead, it fills the matrix with the same decreasing sequence for each row and column, which does not maximize the sum.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix for all possible values of \( n \).
