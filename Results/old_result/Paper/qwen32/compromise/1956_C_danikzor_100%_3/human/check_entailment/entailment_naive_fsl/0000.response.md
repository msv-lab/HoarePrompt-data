Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the operations to maximize the sum of the matrix. Let's analyze why:

The program outputs the maximum possible sum of the matrix and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves. The maximum possible sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with the largest possible distinct integers from 1 to \( n \) is indeed \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \). However, the operations described in the program do not achieve this sum correctly.

The operations provided are:
1. For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), set the row \( i \) to the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
2. For each column \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), set the column \( i \) to the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

This approach does not ensure that the matrix is filled with the largest possible distinct integers in a way that maximizes the sum. Instead, it fills each row and column with the same decreasing sequence, which does not yield the maximum possible sum.

To maximize the sum, we need to ensure that each row and column contains distinct integers from 1 to \( n \) in such a way that the sum is maximized. One correct approach is to fill the matrix in a way that each row and each column contains the integers from 1 to \( n \) exactly once, ensuring that the sum of each row and each column is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).

A correct approach would be to fill the matrix with a Latin square, where each row and each column contains the integers from 1 to \( n \) exactly once. For example, for \( n = 2 \), a correct matrix would be:
```
1 2
2 1
```
This matrix has a sum of \( 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6 \), which is incorrect for \( n = 2 \). The correct sum for \( n = 2 \) is 7, achieved by the following matrix:
```
1 2
2 3
```
However, the program does not generate such a matrix. Instead, it fills the matrix with the same decreasing sequence for each row and column, which does not maximize the sum.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix for all possible values of \( n \).
