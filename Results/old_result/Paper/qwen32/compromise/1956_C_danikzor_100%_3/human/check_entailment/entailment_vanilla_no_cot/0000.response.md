Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix. The operations described in the program do not ensure that the maximum possible sum is achieved.

The optimal way to maximize the sum of the matrix is to fill each row and each column with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n]. This ensures that each element in the matrix is unique and maximized within the constraints.

The program instead fills each row and each column with the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1]. This does not guarantee the maximum sum as it does not ensure that each element in the matrix is unique and maximized.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    max_sum = n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) // 6
    print(max_sum, 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(1, n + 1))
        print(2, i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

This version of the program correctly fills each row and each column with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n], ensuring that the sum of the matrix is maximized.
