Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the original assessment to ensure everything aligns correctly with the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to maximize the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
- Two types of operations are allowed:
  1. Type 1: Assign a permutation to a row.
  2. Type 2: Assign a permutation to a column.
- The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling the `func_1` function. Here is a detailed breakdown of `func_1`:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The function reads the integer \( n \) which is the size of the matrix.

2. **Output Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix elements and the number of operations.
     - The formula used for the maximum sum is \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \).
     - The number of operations is \( 2n \).

3. **Operations Generation:**
   - For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \):
     - Perform a Type 1 operation on row \( i \) using the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
     - Perform a Type 2 operation on column \( i \) using the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

### Verification:
- **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
  - The formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \) is indeed the sum of the first \( n^2 \) natural numbers. This is the maximum sum achievable if each element in the matrix is distinct and ranges from 1 to \( n^2 \).

- **Operations Generation:**
  - The operations are designed to fill the matrix with distinct values from 1 to \( n^2 \).
  - By assigning the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) to each row and then each column, the matrix will be filled such that each row and each column contains distinct values from 1 to \( n \).
  - However, the operations as described do not guarantee that each element in the matrix will be distinct and range from 1 to \( n^2 \). The operations will fill the matrix with numbers from 1 to \( n \) repeatedly, leading to a sum of \( n^2 \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), which is not the maximum possible sum.

### Correct Operations to Maximize Sum:
To achieve the maximum sum, we need to ensure that each element in the matrix is distinct and ranges from 1 to \( n^2 \). A correct approach would be:
1. Fill the matrix row by row with increasing numbers from 1 to \( n^2 \).

### Correct Operations Example:
- For \( n = 2 \):
  - Fill the first row with \( [1, 2] \).
  - Fill the second row with \( [3, 4] \).

This can be achieved with the following operations:
1. Type 1 operation on row 1 with permutation \( [1, 2] \).
2. Type 1 operation on row 2 with permutation \( [3, 4] \).

This results in the matrix:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The sum is \( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 \), which is the maximum possible sum for \( n = 2 \).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly fill the matrix with distinct values from 1 to \( n^2 \) to achieve the maximum sum. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **False**
