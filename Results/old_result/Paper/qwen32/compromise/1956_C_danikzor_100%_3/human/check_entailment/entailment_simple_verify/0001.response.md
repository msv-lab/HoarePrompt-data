Let's systematically evaluate the program to ensure it meets the problem requirements and correctly maximizes the sum of the matrix.

### Problem Recap:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. The operations can be:
1. Type 1: Assign a permutation to a row.
2. Type 2: Assign a permutation to a column.

The maximum sum of the matrix should be the sum of the first \( n^2 \) natural numbers, which is \( \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1`. Here's a detailed breakdown of `func_1`:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The function reads the integer \( n \) which is the size of the matrix.

2. **Output Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix elements and the number of operations.
     - The formula used for the maximum sum is \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \).
     - The number of operations is \( 2n \).

3. **Operations Generation:**
   - For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \):
     - Perform a Type 1 operation on row \( i \) using the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
     - Perform a Type 2 operation on column \( i \) using the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

### Verification:
- **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
  The formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \) is incorrect. The correct formula for the sum of the first \( n^2 \) natural numbers is \( \frac{n^2(n^2 + 1)}{2} \).

- **Operations Generation:**
  - The operations are designed to fill the matrix with distinct values from 1 to \( n^2 \).
  - By assigning the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) to each row and then each column, the matrix will not be filled with distinct values from 1 to \( n^2 \). Instead, it will be filled with values from 1 to \( n \) repeatedly.

### Example Walkthrough:
For \( n = 2 \):
- Correct maximum sum: \( \frac{2^2(2^2 + 1)}{2} = \frac{4 \cdot 5}{2} = 10 \).

- Program's operations:
  - Type 1 on row 1: \([2, 1]\)
  - Type 2 on column 1: \([2, 1]\)
  - Type 1 on row 2: \([2, 1]\)
  - Type 2 on column 2: \([2, 1]\)

  The resulting matrix will be:
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  2 & 1 \\
  2 & 1 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
  Sum: \( 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 6 \), which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
To achieve the maximum sum, we should fill the matrix with distinct values from 1 to \( n^2 \). This can be done by assigning permutations that ensure each row and column contains unique values.

### Conclusion:
The program incorrectly calculates the maximum sum and does not fill the matrix with distinct values from 1 to \( n^2 \). Therefore, the program does not meet the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
