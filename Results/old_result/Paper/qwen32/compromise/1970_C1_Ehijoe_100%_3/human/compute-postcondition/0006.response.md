The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `ends`. This action does not affect any of the other variables (`n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`, `nodes`).

Therefore, the Output State remains the same for all variables except for the newly introduced `ends` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each key from 1 to n (inclusive) has a list of integers representing its neighbors as defined by the input edges, `ends` is an empty list.**
