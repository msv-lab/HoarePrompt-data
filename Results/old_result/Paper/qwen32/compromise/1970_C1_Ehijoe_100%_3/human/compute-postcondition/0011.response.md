The variable `prev` is assigned the value of `s`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each key from 1 to n (inclusive) has a list of integers representing its neighbors as defined by the input edges, `ends` is an empty list, `tree` is a list containing the single element `s`, `prev` is `s`.**
