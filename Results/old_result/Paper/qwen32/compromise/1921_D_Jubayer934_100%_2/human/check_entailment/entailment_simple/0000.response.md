### Reasoning:

The program aims to maximize the total difference \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \) by carefully choosing \( n \) elements from the array \( b \) and arranging them to form the array \( c \).

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Input Parsing and Sorting**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \) and \( m \).
   - It then reads the arrays \( a \) and \( b \).
   - The array \( a \) is sorted in ascending order.
   - The array \( b \) is sorted in descending order.

2. **Choosing Elements for \( c \)**:
   - The program iterates through the first \( n \) elements of the sorted \( a \) and compares the absolute differences between each element of \( a \) and the corresponding elements from the beginning and the end of the sorted \( b \) (to maximize the difference).
   - If the absolute difference with the element from the end of \( b \) is greater, it switches to using elements from the end of \( b \) for the rest of the elements in \( a \).
   - This ensures that the differences are maximized.

3. **Calculating the Total Difference**:
   - The program calculates the absolute differences and sums them up to get the total difference \( D \).

### Analysis:

- **Sorting**: Sorting \( a \) in ascending order and \( b \) in descending order is a good strategy to maximize the differences.
- **Comparison and Switching**: Comparing the absolute differences and switching to the end of \( b \) when necessary ensures that the largest possible differences are used.

### Verification:

The provided program follows the above logic and correctly implements the solution. It handles the input and output as described in the problem statement. The approach ensures that the difference \( D \) is maximized by strategically choosing elements from \( b \).

### Conclusion:

The program is correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.

**Correctness: True**
