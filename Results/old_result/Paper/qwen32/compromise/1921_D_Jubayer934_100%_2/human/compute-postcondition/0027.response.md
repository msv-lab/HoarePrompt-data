The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is `temp + 1`, the absolute difference `abs(a[temp + 1] - b[-(n - (temp + 1))])` is calculated and added to `ans`.

Output State: **`n` remains the first integer from the input, `m` remains the second integer from the input, `temp` is an integer such that `0 <= temp < n`, `ans` contains the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks at the index `temp` and also includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` and `abs(a[temp + 1] - b[-(n - (temp + 1))])`, `a` remains the sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input, `b` remains the first `m` elements of the sorted list of the next `m` integers from the input in reverse order, `i` is `temp + 1`.**
