The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to the variable `temp`. Since `i` is 2, `temp` will now hold the value 2. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`) remain unchanged. The condition provided for the `if` statement and the `break` statement are not executed in this snippet, so they do not affect the output state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, `ans` includes the values `abs(a[0] - b[0])` and `abs(a[1] - b[1])`, `temp` is 2.**
