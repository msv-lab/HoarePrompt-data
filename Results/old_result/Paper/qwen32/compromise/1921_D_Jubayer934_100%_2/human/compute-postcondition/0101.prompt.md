You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5), followed by n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing Petya's array, and m integers b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9) representing the integers Vasya can choose from. The total number of integers m across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        temp = -1
        
        ans = []
        
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]
        
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]
        
        for i in range(n):
            if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
                temp = i
                break
            ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))
        
        if temp != -1:
            for i in range(temp, n):
                ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))
        
        print(sum(ans))
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of the sorted array `a` and the elements of the sorted array `b` (in reverse order), calculated according to the specified conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m` representing the lengths of Petya's array and the list of integers Vasya can choose from, respectively. It also accepts `n` integers `a_i` representing Petya's array and `m` integers `b_i` representing Vasya's choices. The function returns the result for each test case, which is not explicitly detailed in the provided information but can be inferred to be a comparison or operation between Petya's array and Vasya's choices.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
