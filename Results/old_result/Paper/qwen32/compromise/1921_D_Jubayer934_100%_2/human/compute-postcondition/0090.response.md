To ensure that the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than `temp` because the range function in Python generates numbers starting from the first argument up to, but not including, the second argument.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `temp` is the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` first becomes true, and `temp` is not `-1`.
- `ans` is a list of the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to and including the index `temp`.

We need to ensure that `n` is greater than `temp` so that the loop can execute. The value of `i` at the start of the loop should be `temp` as per the loop's range.

State: **`temp` is the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` first becomes true, and `temp` is not `-1`, `n` must be greater than `temp`, `i` is `temp`, `ans` is a list of the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to and including the index `temp`**
