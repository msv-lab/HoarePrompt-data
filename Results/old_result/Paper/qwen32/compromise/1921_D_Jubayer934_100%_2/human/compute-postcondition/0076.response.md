Postcondition: **`temp` is `i` if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1. `ans` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is assigned the value read from the input, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input list, and `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input list in descending order.**
