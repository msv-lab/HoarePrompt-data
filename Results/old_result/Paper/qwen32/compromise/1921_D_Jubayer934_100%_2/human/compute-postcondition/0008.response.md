The code snippet `temp = i` assigns the value of `i` to a new variable `temp`. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Since `i` is 0, `temp` will also be 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `temp` is 0.**
