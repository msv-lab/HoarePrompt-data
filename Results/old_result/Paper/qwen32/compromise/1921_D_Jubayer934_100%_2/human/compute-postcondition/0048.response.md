Postcondition: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, `ans` includes `abs(a[i] - b[i])`. If `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` is greater than `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, then `temp` is set to `i` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `temp` retains its previous value.**
