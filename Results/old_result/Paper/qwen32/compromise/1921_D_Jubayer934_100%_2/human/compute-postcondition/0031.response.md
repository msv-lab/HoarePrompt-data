Postcondition: **`n` remains the first integer from the input, `m` remains the second integer from the input, `temp` is either -1 if the loop completes all iterations without finding an `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` is greater than `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, or it is the index `i` where this condition was first met. `ans` contains the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all iterations. `a` remains the sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input, `b` remains the first `m` elements of the sorted list of the next `m` integers from the input in reverse order.**
