The code snippet `ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))` appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. This means that the list `ans` will now have one more element, which is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

The values of `temp`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged by this operation. The variable `i` is incremented elsewhere in the code, but in this specific snippet, it is not affected.

Output State: **`temp` is `i` if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1; `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all previous `i` values and the newly appended value `abs(a[i] - b[i])`; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is assigned the value read from the input; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input list; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input list in descending order; `i` is `i + 1`.**
