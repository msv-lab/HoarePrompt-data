Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m` representing the lengths of Petya's array and the list of integers Vasya can choose from, respectively. It also accepts `n` integers `a_i` representing Petya's array and `m` integers `b_i` representing Vasya's choices. The function returns the result for each test case, which is not explicitly detailed in the provided information but can be inferred to be a comparison or operation between Petya's array and Vasya's choices.**
