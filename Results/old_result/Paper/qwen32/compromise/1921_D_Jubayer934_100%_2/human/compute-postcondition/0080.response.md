Output State: **`temp` is `i`; `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is assigned the value read from the input; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input list; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input list in descending order; `i` is incremented by 1; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of `temp`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain as specified in the initial state, with the only change being that `i` has been incremented by 1. The program execution is terminated at the point of the `break` statement.
