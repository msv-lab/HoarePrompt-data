The code snippet provided simply assigns the value `-1` to the variable `temp`. This assignment does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `temp`. 

The initial state specifies that `temp` can be either `-1` or an index `i` where a certain condition was met. After executing the provided code, `temp` is explicitly set to `-1`, overriding any previous value it might have had.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is -1, `ans` contains the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all iterations, `a` remains the sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input, `b` remains the first `m` elements of the sorted list of the next `m` integers from the input in reverse order.**
