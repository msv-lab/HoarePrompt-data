The `break` statement in the code will exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `temp`, and `i` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 2`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, `ans` includes `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, `temp` is `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
