Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `temp` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The values of the variables do not change, but the loop or if statement we were directly inside is exited.
