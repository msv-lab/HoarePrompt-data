To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior and the conditions that control the loop. The loop starts at `temp` and continues until `i` reaches `n`. For each iteration, it calculates the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` and appends it to `ans`.

Given the loop's behavior, the loop will execute from `temp` to `n-1`. This means that after all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, and `ans` will contain the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for all `i` from `temp` to `n-1`.

Here's the Output State after all iterations:

Output State: **`n` remains the first integer from the input, `m` remains the second integer from the input, `temp` is an integer such that `0 <= temp < n`, `ans` contains the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks at the index `temp` and also includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for all `i` from `temp` to `n-1`, `a` remains the sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input, `b` remains the first `m` elements of the sorted list of the next `m` integers from the input in reverse order, `i` is `n`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `ans` will have all the required absolute differences calculated from the index `temp` to the end of the list `a` (i.e., up to index `n-1`), and `i` will have reached `n`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `a`, `b`) will remain unchanged as per their initial states.
