The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`, which iterates over the list `nums`. Therefore, the state of `nums` is the only one that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. Specifically, for the loop to execute, `nums` must contain at least one element.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is `len(nums) - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is {}, `nums` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is updated to the accumulated sum based on the counts in `num_of_lens`**.
