Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2; `res` is updated to `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is updated to `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`; `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens` where the value is not equal to `cnt`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `res` has been updated by adding `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
