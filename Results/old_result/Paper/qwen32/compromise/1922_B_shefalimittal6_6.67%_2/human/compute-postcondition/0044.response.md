The code snippet increments the count of `x` in the `num_of_lens` dictionary by 1. The value of `x` is `nums[t + 1]`, and `num_of_lens` is an updated dictionary that keeps track of the counts of each number in `nums`.

Output State: **`t` is `t + 1` such that 0 â‰¤ `t + 1` < length of `nums`; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is an updated dictionary where the count of `nums[t + 1]` is incremented by 1; `nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element; `res` is the sum of all combinations of counts in `num_of_lens` taken 3 at a time for counts 3 and above, plus the product of combinations of counts in `num_of_lens` taken 2 at a time for counts 2 and above and the sum of all other counts; `x` is `nums[t + 1]`.**

In simpler terms, the count of the number at position `t + 1` in the `nums` list is increased by 1 in the `num_of_lens` dictionary. All other variables remain unchanged.
