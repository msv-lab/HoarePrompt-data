The code snippet provided is `res += math.comb(cnt, 3)`. This line of code adds the combination of `cnt` taken 3 at a time to the variable `res`. However, the variable `cnt` is not defined in the initial state provided. Since `cnt` is not defined, it's impossible to calculate the exact value of `res` after the operation. Assuming `cnt` is a variable that has been defined elsewhere in the code and is known, we can only express the change in terms of `cnt`.

Given that `res` is not defined in the initial state, we will assume `res` is initialized to `0` for the purpose of this task, as it's a common practice to initialize variables before using them in arithmetic operations.

Output State: **`t` is `0`, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is `{5: 1}`, `nums` is `[5]`, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3)`**
In natural language: The value of `res` is updated to be the combination of `cnt` taken 3 at a time. The values of `t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, and `nums` remain unchanged.
