The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1` increments the count of `x` in the `num_of_lens` dictionary by 1. If `x` does not exist in `num_of_lens`, it initializes the count to 1.

Given the initial state, `num_of_lens` is updated such that the count of `x` is incremented by 1. Other variables like `t`, `n`, `nums`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `len(nums) - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is updated such that the count of `x` is incremented by 1, `nums` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is updated to the accumulated sum based on the counts in `num_of_lens`.**
