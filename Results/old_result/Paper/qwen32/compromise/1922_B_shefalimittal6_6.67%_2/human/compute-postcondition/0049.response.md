Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` equals the length of `nums`; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, where the value is the count of a unique integer in `nums`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is `res + math.comb(cnt, 3)`; `cnt` is an integer with a value greater than or equal to 3.**

Natural Language: The value of `res` has been updated to include the combination of `cnt` taken 3 at a time (`math.comb(cnt, 3)`). All other variables remain unchanged.
