Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `t` is `0`
- `n` is an input integer
- `num_of_lens` is `{5: 1}`
- `nums` is `[5]`
- If `cnt` is `0`, `res` is `0`
- If `cnt` is `1`, `res` is `1`
- If `cnt` is `2`, `res` is `0`
- If `cnt` is `>= 3`, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2)`

Code to execute:
```
res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
```

The code adds the combination of `cnt` taken 3 at a time to `res`. The value of `res` before this operation depends on the value of `cnt`:
- If `cnt` is `0`, `res` is `0`
- If `cnt` is `1`, `res` is `1`
- If `cnt` is `2`, `res` is `0`
- If `cnt` is `>= 3`, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2)`

After the code execution, the new value of `res` will be:
- If `cnt` is `0`, `res` remains `0` (since `math.comb(0, 3)` is `0`)
- If `cnt` is `1`, `res` remains `1` (since `math.comb(1, 3)` is `0`)
- If `cnt` is `2`, `res` remains `0` (since `math.comb(2, 3)` is `0`)
- If `cnt` is `>= 3`, `res` becomes `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) + math.comb(cnt, 3)` which simplifies to `2 * math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2)`

Output State: **`t` is `0`, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is `{5: 1}`, `nums` is `[5]`, If `cnt` is `0`, `res` is `0`; If `cnt` is `1`, `res` is `1`; If `cnt` is `2`, `res` is `0`; If `cnt` is `>= 3`, `res` is `2 * math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2)`**
