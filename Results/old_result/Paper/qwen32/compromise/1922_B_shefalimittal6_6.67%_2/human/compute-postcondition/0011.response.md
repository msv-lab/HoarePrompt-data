Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `nums` and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `nums`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; the loop has finished iterating through all elements in `nums`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing, the dictionary `num_of_lens` will contain each unique integer from the list `nums` as keys, and the values will represent how many times each integer appears in the list. All other variables (`t` and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
