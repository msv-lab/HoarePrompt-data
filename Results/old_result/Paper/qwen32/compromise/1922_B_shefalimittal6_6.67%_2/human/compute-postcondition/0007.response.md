The only variable in the loop head is `x`, which is the current element being iterated over from the list `nums`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `x` and how it changes during the loop.

Given that `x` is the current element in the iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be the next element in the list `nums`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, and `nums` are not modified in the loop head and thus remain unchanged.

From the state at the end of the previous iteration, `x` has taken on the value of the current element in `nums`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be the next element in the list.

Let's denote the current index of `x` in `nums` as `current_index`. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was `nums[current_index]`. At the start of the next iteration, `x` will be `nums[current_index + 1]`.

Since we do not have the specific value of `current_index` from the previous state, we can only express the state in terms of the next element in `nums`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is 1 if `x` was not previously in `num_of_lens`, or incremented by 1 if `x` was already in `num_of_lens`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least one integer; `x` is the next element in `nums`**.
