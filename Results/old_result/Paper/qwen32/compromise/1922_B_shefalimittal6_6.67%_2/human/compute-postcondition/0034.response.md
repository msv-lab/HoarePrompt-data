To determine what will be printed by the `print(res)` statement, we need to break down the components of the `res` variable based on the given initial state.

### Given Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `nums` and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `nums`.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `res` is the sum of all combinations of counts in `num_of_lens` taken 3 at a time for counts 3 and above, plus the product of combinations of counts in `num_of_lens` taken 2 at a time for counts 2 and above and the sum of all other counts.

### Calculation of `res`:

1. **Combinations of counts taken 3 at a time (for counts 3 and above):**
   - This involves selecting 3 counts from the values in `num_of_lens` where each count is 3 or more.
   - For each combination, the product of the three counts is calculated.
   - The sum of all these products is part of `res`.

2. **Combinations of counts taken 2 at a time (for counts 2 and above):**
   - This involves selecting 2 counts from the values in `num_of_lens` where each count is 2 or more.
   - For each combination, the product of the two counts is calculated.
   - The sum of all these products is part of `res`.

3. **Sum of all other counts:**
   - This is simply the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens` that are less than 2.
   - Since counts are non-negative integers, this sum includes only counts that are exactly 1.

### Final `res` Calculation:
- `res` is the sum of the products of all combinations of counts taken 3 at a time (for counts 3 and above) plus the sum of the products of all combinations of counts taken 2 at a time (for counts 2 and above) multiplied by the sum of all counts that are 1.

### Output Description:
Given the above breakdown, the output will be the computed value of `res` based on the specific counts in `num_of_lens`.

Since the exact values of `nums` and `num_of_lens` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `res`.

Output: **res (where res is the calculated sum of all combinations of counts in num_of_lens taken 3 at a time for counts 3 and above, plus the product of combinations of counts in num_of_lens taken 2 at a time for counts 2 and above and the sum of all other counts)**
