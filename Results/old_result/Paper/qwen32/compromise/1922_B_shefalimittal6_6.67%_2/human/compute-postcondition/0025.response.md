The provided code snippet updates the variable `res` by adding the result of `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair.
- `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer.
- `cnt` is the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`.
- `res` is updated based on the value of `cnt` and `total_sum`.
- `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens` where the value is not equal to `cnt`.

The code snippet modifies `res` by adding `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` to it. Therefore, the new value of `res` is the old value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `cnt` is the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`. `res` is updated to its old value plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens` where the value is not equal to `cnt`.**
