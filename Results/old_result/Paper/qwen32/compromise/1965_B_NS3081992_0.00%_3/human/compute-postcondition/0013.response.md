The code snippet calculates the length of the binary string representation of `k` and assigns it to the variable `lk`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, and `bk`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is an empty list, `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk`.**
