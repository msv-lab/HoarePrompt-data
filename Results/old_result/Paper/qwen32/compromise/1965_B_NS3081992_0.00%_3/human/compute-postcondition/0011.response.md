The code snippet `bk = bin(k)[2:]` converts the integer `k` to its binary string representation without the '0b' prefix and assigns it to the variable `bk`. The values of `n`, `b`, and `l` remain unchanged. Since `k` is not equal to 1, its binary representation will be a string of '0's and '1's that is not simply '1'.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, and `bk` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**
