Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, `b` is the binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary string `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, and `bk` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix; `ans` is an empty list.**

Natural language: The variable `ans` has been initialized as an empty list. The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, and `bk` remain unchanged as they were initially described.
