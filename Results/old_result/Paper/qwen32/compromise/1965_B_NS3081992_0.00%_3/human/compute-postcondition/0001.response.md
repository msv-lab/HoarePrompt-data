To determine the output state, we need to understand the loop's behavior. The loop iterates `func_10()` times, and in each iteration, it writes the result of `func_14()` to the standard output followed by a newline character.

Given that `func_10()` returns the number of test cases and `func_14()` processes each test case to determine and return some value (let's assume it's the size of the sequence or some result based on the sequence), the loop will print the result of `func_14()` for each test case.

Since the exact behavior of `func_10()` and `func_14()` is not provided, we can only describe the output state in terms of the number of iterations and the output of `func_14()` for each iteration.

Let's assume `func_10()` returns `t` (the number of test cases) and `func_14()` returns some value `result` for each test case. The output will be `t` lines, each containing the result of `func_14()` for that test case.

For the sake of explanation, let's assume `func_10()` returns 3 and `func_14()` returns 5, 10, and 15 for the three test cases respectively. The output would be:
```
5
10
15
```

However, since the exact values are not provided, we'll describe the output state in a general form.

Output State: **The output will consist of `t` lines, where each line contains the result of `func_14()` for each test case.**
