d is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, k) representing the parameters of a test case, with 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. The length of d (number of test cases) is between 1 and 1000, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7. processing, da, and rank are additional parameters that are not specified in the problem description and may be used within the function for internal purposes.
