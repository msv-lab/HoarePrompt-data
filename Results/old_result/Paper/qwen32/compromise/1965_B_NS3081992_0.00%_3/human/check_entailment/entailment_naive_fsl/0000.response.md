Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as specified in the problem description. Let's analyze the function `func_14` which is responsible for generating the sequence `a` for each test case.

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Handling when `k == 1`:**
   - When `k == 1`, the code correctly handles the case when `n == 2` by returning the sequence `[2]`.
   - For other values of `n`, the sequence generated is `[2, 3]` followed by powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
   - However, this sequence does not guarantee that there is no subsequence that sums to `k = 1`. For example, if `n = 4`, the sequence `[2, 3, 4]` should be checked to ensure no subsequence sums to `1`. But the code does not explicitly check or handle this.

2. **Handling when `k > 1`:**
   - The code generates a sequence that includes powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`, with additional elements such as `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1`.
   - However, this sequence does not guarantee that there is no subsequence that sums to `k`. For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 7`, the sequence generated might not correctly exclude the sum `k = 7`.

### Example Case Where the Code Fails:

Let's consider the test case `n = 10` and `k = 7`:

- The binary representation of `n` is `1010` (length 4).
- The binary representation of `k` is `111` (length 3).
- The sequence generated by the code might be something like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 15]`.
- The sum `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`, which is equal to `k`. This violates the condition that there should be no subsequence that sums to `k`.

### Conclusion:
Since there are potential cases where the generated sequence does not meet the conditions specified in the problem description, the code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
