### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided code and analyze whether it correctly implements the solution to the problem.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_10()`: Reads a single integer from the input, which is the number of test cases.
   - `func_7()`: Reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers. This is used to read the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - `func_15()`: Iterates over the number of test cases, calling `func_14()` for each test case and writing the result to the standard output.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - `func_14()`: This is the core function that processes each test case and constructs the sequence `a` based on the values of `n` and `k`.
     - Handles the special case where `k == 1` separately.
     - For `k > 1`, it constructs a sequence that ensures no subsequence sums to `k` while ensuring all other sums from 1 to `n` (except `k`) are possible.
     - The sequence is constructed using powers of 2 and additional elements to ensure the conditions are met.

3. **Output**:
   - The sequence `a` is returned as a space-separated string for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Special Case Handling**:
  - When `k == 1`, the function constructs a sequence `[2, 3, 4, 8, ...]` which ensures no subsequence sums to 1.
  - For `n == 2` and `k == 1`, the function returns `[2]` which is correct as the only possible sum is 2 (not 1).

- **General Case Handling**:
  - For `k > 1`, the function constructs a sequence that includes powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`.
  - It then adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1` to the sequence.
  - Finally, it adds additional powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

### Correctness:

The provided solution constructs the sequence `a` in a way that ensures:
- There is no subsequence that sums to `k`.
- For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there exists a subsequence that sums to `v`.

The logic in `func_14()` is correct for the problem constraints and handles both the special case and the general case appropriately.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

**Correctness: True**
