The function takes two non-negative integer parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`. If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of the remainder of `extroverts` divided by 3 and `universals` is less than 3, the function returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3.
