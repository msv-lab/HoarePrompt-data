### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the code and the function summaries to determine if the program correctly solves the problem described.

#### Problem Analysis Recap:
1. **Introverts (a)**: Each introvert requires a tent by themselves.
2. **Extroverts (b)**: Each extrovert requires a tent with exactly two other people.
3. **Universals (c)**: Universals can be placed in a tent with 0, 1, or 2 others.

The goal is to determine the minimum number of tents required to accommodate everyone according to their preferences. If it's impossible, return -1.

#### Program Analysis Recap:
- `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`: This function calculates the number of tents required for extroverts and any additional universals to fulfill the requirement that extroverts are in tents with two other people.
- `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`: This function calculates the total number of tents required by adding the tents for introverts to the result from `func_1`.

#### Function `func_1`:
- If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, it checks if the remaining extroverts plus universals can form a tent together.
- If not, it returns `None`, indicating that it's impossible to fulfill the extroverts' requirement.
- Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which represents the number of tents needed.

#### Function `func_2`:
- It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
- If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns -1, indicating an impossible arrangement.
- Otherwise, it adds the number of tents for introverts (which is equal to the number of introverts, since each introvert needs a tent by themselves) to the result from `func_1`.

#### Correctness Check Recap:
The original assessment runs through several examples and shows that the program produces the expected output. However, let's verify the logic of `func_1` more rigorously:

- **Case 1**: If `extroverts % 3 == 0`, the number of extroverts can be perfectly grouped into tents of 3. The remaining universals can be distributed as needed, and the number of tents is simply `extroverts // 3 + ceil(universals / 3)`.
- **Case 2**: If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, we need to check if the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals to form a tent. Specifically, if `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it's impossible to form a tent with the remaining extroverts and universals, and we should return `None`.

The function `func_1` correctly handles these cases. Let's check a few edge cases:

1. **Edge Case 1**: `a=0, b=0, c=0`
   - `func_1(0, 0)` returns `0` (no tents needed).
   - `func_2(0, 0, 0)` returns `0`.

2. **Edge Case 2**: `a=0, b=1, c=1`
   - `func_1(1, 1)` returns `None` (1 extrovert and 1 universal cannot form a tent).
   - `func_2(0, 1, 1)` returns `-1`.

3. **Edge Case 3**: `a=0, b=2, c=1`
   - `func_1(2, 1)` returns `1` (2 extroverts and 1 universal can form one tent).
   - `func_2(0, 2, 1)` returns `1`.

4. **Edge Case 4**: `a=0, b=5, c=1`
   - `func_1(5, 1)` returns `None` (5 extroverts and 1 universal cannot form the required groups).
   - `func_2(0, 5, 1)` returns `-1`.

5. **Edge Case 5**: `a=0, b=5, c=2`
   - `func_1(5, 2)` returns `2` (5 extroverts and 2 universals can form two tents).
   - `func_2(0, 5, 2)` returns `2`.

The function `func_1` handles these edge cases correctly. Therefore, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of tents required or determines if it's impossible to satisfy the participants' preferences.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis and verification of the edge cases, the original assessment appears to be accurate.

Final: **True**
