To determine if the given Python program is correct, let's analyze the problem and the code step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Introverts**: Each introvert needs a tent alone.
2. **Extroverts**: Each extrovert needs a tent with exactly 2 others.
3. **Universals**: Can be placed in any tent configuration.

### Conditions:
- If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, the remaining extroverts need to be paired with universals to form a tent of 3.
- If the remaining extroverts after forming groups of 3 cannot be paired with enough universals, it's impossible to accommodate everyone, and the result should be -1.
- Otherwise, the result is the number of tents needed for introverts plus the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Takes `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments.
   - Checks if `extroverts` is not a multiple of 3.
   - If not, it checks if the sum of `extroverts % 3` and `universals` is less than 3. If so, it returns `None` (indicating it's impossible to form a valid tent with the remaining extroverts).
   - Otherwise, it calculates the total number of tents needed for extroverts and universals by dividing the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3 and rounding up using `ceil`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of tents needed for introverts (`introverts`) and the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals (`ret`).

### Testing the Code:
Let's test the code with the provided example inputs to see if it produces the correct outputs.

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `1 2 3`
- Expected Output: `3`
- Code Output: `3`
  - `func_1(2, 3)`: `2 % 3` is not 0, but `2 % 3 + 3` is 5, which is not less than 3. So, `ceil((2 + 3) / 3)` is `ceil(5 / 3)` which is `2`.
  - `func_2(1, 2, 3)`: `1 + 2` is `3`.

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `1 4 1`
- Expected Output: `-1`
- Code Output: `-1`
  - `func_1(4, 1)`: `4 % 3` is 1, and `1 + 1` is 2, which is less than 3. So, it returns `None`.
  - `func_2(1, 4, 1)`: Returns `-1`.

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `1 4 2`
- Expected Output: `3`
- Code Output: `3`
  - `func_1(4, 2)`: `4 % 3` is 1, and `1 + 2` is 3, which is not less than 3. So, `ceil((4 + 2) / 3)` is `ceil(6 / 3)` which is `2`.
  - `func_2(1, 4, 2)`: `1 + 2` is `3`.

#### Test Case 4:
- Input: `1 1 1`
- Expected Output: `-1`
- Code Output: `-1`
  - `func_1(1, 1)`: `1 % 3` is 1, and `1 + 1` is 2, which is less than 3. So, it returns `None`.
  - `func_2(1, 1, 1)`: Returns `-1`.

#### Test Case 5:
- Input: `1 3 2`
- Expected Output: `3`
- Code Output: `3`
  - `func_1(3, 2)`: `3 % 3` is 0, so it calculates `ceil((3 + 2) / 3)` which is `ceil(5 / 3)` which is `2`.
  - `func_2(1, 3, 2)`: `1 + 2` is `3`.

#### Test Case 6:
- Input: `19 7 18`
- Expected Output: `28`
- Code Output: `28`
  - `func_1(7, 18)`: `7 % 3` is 1, and `1 + 18` is 19, which is not less than 3. So, `ceil((7 + 18) / 3)` is `ceil(25 / 3)` which is `9`.
  - `func_2(19, 7, 18)`: `19 + 9` is `28`.

#### Test Case 7:
- Input: `0 0 0`
- Expected Output: `0`
- Code Output: `0`
  - `func_1(0, 0)`: `0 % 3` is 0, so it calculates `ceil((0 + 0) / 3)` which is `0`.
  - `func_2(0, 0, 0)`: `0 + 0` is `0`.

#### Test Case 8:
- Input: `7 0 0`
- Expected Output: `7`
- Code Output: `7`
  - `func_1(0, 0)`: `0 % 3` is 0, so it calculates `ceil((0 + 0) / 3)` which is `0`.
  - `func_2(7, 0, 0)`: `7 + 0` is `7`.

#### Test Case 9:
- Input: `0 24 0`
- Expected Output: `8`
- Code Output: `8`
  - `func_1(24, 0)`: `24 % 3` is 0, so it calculates `ceil((24 + 0) / 3)` which is `8`.
  - `func_2(0, 24, 0)`: `0 + 8` is `8`.

#### Test Case 10:
- Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
- Expected Output: `1666666667`
- Code Output: `1666666667`
  - `func_1(1000000000, 1000000000)`: `1000000000 % 3` is 1, and `1 + 1000000000` is 1000000001, which is not less than 3. So, `ceil((1000000000 + 1000000000) / 3)` is `ceil(2000000000 / 3)` which is `666666667`.
  - `func_2(1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)`: `1000000000 + 666666667` is `1666666667`.

### Conclusion:
The code appears to correctly handle all the test cases provided in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
