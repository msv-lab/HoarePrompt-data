The code snippet assigns the value of `x` to the variable `ans`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `r`, and `c`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is the first return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the second return value of `func_3()`, `x` is the third return value of `func_3()`, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= r <= n - 1, and `c` is a character that can be '0', '1', or '?'; `ans` is `x`.**
