The code snippet `temp.add((q + r) % n)` modifies the `temp` set by adding a new element to it. The new element is calculated as `(q + r) % n`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the first return value of `func_3()`
- `m` is the second return value of `func_3()` and must be greater than 0
- `x` is the third return value of `func_3()` and must be an iterable with at least one element
- `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`
- `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()` and can be either '0' or '?'
- `ans` is `x` with at least one element remaining
- `q` is the next element in `ans`

The value of `q` is added to `r`, and the result is taken modulo `n`. This new value is then added to the set `temp`.

Since `q`, `r`, and `n` have specific roles and values, the new element in `temp` is `(q + r) % n`.

The values of `m`, `x`, `c`, `ans`, and `q` remain unchanged, and `temp` now includes the new element `(q + r) % n`.

Output State: **`n` is the first return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the second return value of `func_3()` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the third return value of `func_3()` and must be an iterable with at least one element, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()` and can be either '0' or '?', `ans` is `x` with at least one element remaining, `q` is the next element in `ans`, and `temp` includes the new element `(q + r) % n`.**
