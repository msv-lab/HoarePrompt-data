The code snippet provided adds a new element to the set `temp` based on the expression `(q - r) % n`. Since `c` is not '0' or '?', the condition for adding `(q + r) % n` to `temp` is not met. Instead, the code directly adds `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.

Given the initial state, the only change is in the `temp` set, as it now includes the new element `(q - r) % n`.

Output State: **`n` is the first return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the second return value of `func_3()` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the third return value of `func_3()` and must be an iterable with at least one element, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()` and can be either '0' or '?', `ans` is `x` with at least one element remaining, `temp` contains the new element `(q - r) % n`.**
