The code snippet adds a new element to the set `temp`. The new element is calculated as `(q - r) % n`. Since `r` is an integer value returned by `func_1().split()`, the exact value of `r` is not specified, but it is used in the calculation of the new element.

The variable `c` can be either '1' or '?', and this does not change. If `c` was '?', `temp` initially contained the element `(q + r) % n`. If `c` was '1', `temp` was an empty set. After the code execution, `temp` will contain its previous elements plus the new element `(q - r) % n`.

Other variables `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`c` is either '1' or '?'; if `c` is '?', `temp` contains the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, otherwise `temp` contains the element `(q - r) % n`; `n`, `m`, `x`, and `ans` remain unchanged; `r` is an integer value returned by `func_1().split()`.**
