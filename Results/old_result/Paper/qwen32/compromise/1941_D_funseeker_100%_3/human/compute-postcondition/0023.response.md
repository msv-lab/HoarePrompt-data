Output State: **`n` is the first return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the second return value of `func_3()` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the third return value of `func_3()`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, `ans` is `x`, `temp` is a set containing all unique values computed from `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `x` if `c` is '1' or '?'. If `c` is '0', `temp` remains an empty set.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all iterations, `temp` will contain all unique values calculated from `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each element `q` in `x` if `c` is '1' or '?'. If `c` is '0', `temp` will remain an empty set. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
