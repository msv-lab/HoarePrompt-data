The only variable in the loop head is `q`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the iterable `ans`. If `ans` has at least one element remaining, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is `x` with at least one element remaining. For the loop to execute one more time, `ans` must still have at least one element remaining, and `q` will be the next element in `ans`.

State: **`n` is the first return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the second return value of `func_3()` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the third return value of `func_3()` and must be an iterable with at least one element, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()` and can be either '0' or '?', `ans` is `x` with at least one element remaining, `q` is the next element in `ans`**
