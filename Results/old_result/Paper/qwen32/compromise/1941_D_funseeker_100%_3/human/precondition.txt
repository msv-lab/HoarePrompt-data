t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of three integers n, m, x where 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. Following these integers, there are m lines, each containing an integer r_i such that 1 <= r_i <= n - 1, and a symbol c_i which can be '0', '1', or '?'. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
