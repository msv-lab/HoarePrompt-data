### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - This part is correctly implemented as per the problem description.

2. **Logic for Ball Movement:**
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it processes the set of possible players who could have the ball (`ans`).
   - For each player in `ans`, it calculates the new possible positions based on the direction of the throw:
     - If the direction is clockwise (`'0'`) or unknown (`'?'`), it adds the player `(q + r) % n` to the new set `temp`.
     - If the direction is counterclockwise (`'1'`) or unknown (`'?'`), it adds the player `(q - r) % n` to the new set `temp`.
   - It updates `ans` to be the new set `temp` after processing each throw.
   - This logic is correctly implemented according to the problem description.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the calculated position is `0` by converting it to `n`.
   - It ensures that the output is sorted and contains unique player numbers.
   - The edge case handling is correctly implemented.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, it prints the number of possible players who could have the ball and their numbers in increasing order.
   - The output format matches the problem description.

### Verification Against Function Summary:
- The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_4`. It states that the function computes a set of unique values based on a series of operations involving addition and subtraction modulo `n`. It starts with an initial value `x` and iteratively updates this set `m` times by adding or subtracting `r` modulo `n`, depending on the character `c` which can be '0', '1', or '?'. If the result of these operations includes `0`, it is replaced with `n`. The function then prints the number of elements in the final set and the sorted elements themselves.
- This matches the implementation of `func_4` in the provided code.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible players who could have the ball after the given throws. It handles all specified cases and constraints appropriately. The function summary aligns with the implementation, and there are no apparent issues in the code.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
