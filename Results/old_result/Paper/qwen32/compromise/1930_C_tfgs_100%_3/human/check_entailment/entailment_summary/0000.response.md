### Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing the lexicographically largest array `b` by performing a series of operations on an array `a` and a set `S`. The operations involve adding an index-based increment to each element of `a` and then inserting these modified elements into a set `S`. Since sets do not allow duplicates, the final set `S` will contain unique values. The array `b` is then formed by sorting the elements of `S` in decreasing order.

Let's break down the provided program to ensure it correctly implements the solution:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Updating Array Elements:**
   - For each element `a_i` in the array, it adds `i + 1` to it, where `i` is the zero-based index of the element. This step correctly reflects the problem statement.

3. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the updated array.
   - It converts the updated array to a set to remove duplicates and then sorts this set in decreasing order. This ensures that the final array `b` will be sorted in decreasing order.

4. **Constructing the Final Array `b`:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted unique elements and adds them to the result list `ans`.
   - It also handles the case where some elements were present multiple times in the original array by adding the appropriate number of decremented values to `ans` to account for these duplicates. This part ensures that the final array `b` is lexicographically as large as possible.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final array `b` for each test case.

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the constraints and ensures that the final array `b` is constructed in a way that it is lexicographically the largest possible.

### Correctness: **True**
