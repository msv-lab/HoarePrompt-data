### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the problem description and produces the correct output.

1. **Input Reading and Initial Transformations:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.
   - It then modifies each element `a[i]` to `a[i] + i + 1` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Removing Duplicates and Sorting:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the modified array.
   - It converts the array `a` to a set to remove duplicates and then sorts this set in descending order.

3. **Constructing the Result Array `b`:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the final result.
   - It iterates through the sorted unique elements of `a`.
   - For each element, it calculates the number of additional elements to insert between the current and previous elements in `ans` based on the count of duplicates and the number of remaining elements to insert.
   - It appends these additional elements to `ans` and then appends the current element.
   - It updates the count of the current element in the `Counter` and adjusts the `cur` variable which keeps track of the number of remaining duplicates to be inserted.

4. **Final Adjustments:**
   - After the loop, if there are still elements to be inserted (`cnt` > 0), the program appends `cnt` additional elements to `ans` by decrementing the last element in `ans` by 1 for each additional element.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.

### Analysis:

- **Lexicographical Order:**
  - The program ensures that the result array `b` is constructed in such a way that it is lexicographically largest by sorting the unique elements in descending order and inserting duplicates appropriately.

- **Handling Duplicates:**
  - The program uses a `Counter` to keep track of the number of occurrences of each element and inserts duplicates in the correct positions to maximize the lexicographical order.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles cases where all elements are the same by inserting the correct number of duplicates.
  - It also handles cases where the elements are distinct by simply sorting them in descending order.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the problem description and produces the lexicographically largest array `b` for each test case.

### Your response:

Correctness: **True**
