Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least one element, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the updated list `a` with the count of `a[i]` decremented by 1 for each processed element, `cur` is the running sum of the decremented counts of the elements in `a` minus `adv`, `cnt` is recalculated at the start of each iteration and is now `cnt - adv` if `i > 0`, `ans` is a list containing all the accumulated values based on the condition and the value of `adv`, `i` is the final index of the last processed element in `a` or the end of the list, and `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur` for the last iteration if `i > 0`. If `i` is not greater than 0, `cnt`, `ans`, and `adv` remain unchanged.**
