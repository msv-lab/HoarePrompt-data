Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` is updated to `a_i + (i + 1)`, with `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. Specifically, `a[i]` is now `a[i] + (i + 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, each element `a_i` in the list `a` has been incremented by its 1-based index value. For example, `a[0]` is increased by 1, `a[1]` is increased by 2, and so on up to `a[n-1]` which is increased by `n`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
