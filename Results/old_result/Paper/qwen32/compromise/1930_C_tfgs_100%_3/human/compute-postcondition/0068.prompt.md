Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the updated list `a` with the count of `a[i]` decremented by 1 for each processed element; `cur` is the final sum of the decremented counts of the elements in `a` minus the accumulated `adv` values; `cnt` is `n - len(a)` minus the total `adv` accumulated during the loop; `ans` is a list containing all the values appended during the loop.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(cnt):
    ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the updated list `a` with the count of `a[i]` decremented by 1 for each processed element; `cur` is the final sum of the decremented counts of the elements in `a` minus the accumulated `adv` values; `cnt` is `n - len(a)` minus the total `adv` accumulated during the loop such that `cnt` must be greater than 0; `ans` is a list containing all the values appended during the loop with the last element decremented by 1 and a new element appended which is the last element minus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the updated list `a` with the count of `a[i]` decremented by 1 for each processed element; `cur` is the final sum of the decremented counts of the elements in `a` minus the accumulated `adv` values; `cnt` is `cnt - 1`; `ans` is a list containing all the values appended during the loop with the last element decremented by 1 and a new element appended which is the last element minus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the updated list `a` with the count of `a[i]` decremented by 1 for each processed element, `cur` is the final sum of the decremented counts of the elements in `a` minus the accumulated `adv` values, `cnt` is `cnt`, `ans` is a list containing all the values appended during the loop with the last element decremented by 1 and a new element appended which is the last element minus 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
