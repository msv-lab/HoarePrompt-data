Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least one element, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the updated list `a` with the count of `a[i]` decremented by 1, `cur` is the previous value of `cur` plus `counter[a[i]]`, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - 2*adv` if `i > 0` and `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1 > 0`, `ans` is a list containing `adv` elements, each equal to `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` from 0 to `adv - 1` plus `a[i]` if `i > 0` and `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1 > 0`, otherwise `cur`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged, `i` is `i + 1` such that `1 ≤ i + 1 < len(a)` if the if condition is met, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `ans` now includes `a[i]` as its last element.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(adv):
    ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least one element, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the updated list `a` with the count of `a[i]` decremented by 1, `cur` is the previous value of `cur` plus `counter[a[i]]`, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - 2*adv` if `i > 0` and `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1 > 0`, `ans` is a list containing `adv` elements, each equal to `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` from 0 to `adv - 1` plus `a[i]` if `i > 0` and `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1 > 0` plus the newly appended value `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, otherwise `cur`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged, `i` is `i + 1` such that `1 ≤ i + 1 < len(a)` if the if condition is met, `adv` is greater than 0, `ans` now includes `a[i - 1] - j - 1` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least one element, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the updated list `a` with the count of `a[i]` decremented by 1, `cur` is the previous value of `cur` plus `counter[a[i]]`, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - 2*adv` if `i > 0` and `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1 > 0`, `ans` is a list containing `adv` elements, each equal to `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` from 0 to `adv - 1` plus `a[i]` if `i > 0` and `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1 > 0` plus the newly appended value `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `i` is `i + 1` such that `1 ≤ i + 1 < len(a)` if the if condition is met, `adv` is greater than 0, `ans` now includes `a[i - 1] - j - 1` as its last element, `j` is `j + 1` such that `j < adv`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least one element, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the updated list `a` with the count of `a[i]` decremented by 1, `cur` is the previous value of `cur` plus `counter[a[i]]`, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - 2*adv` if `i > 0` and `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1 > 0`, `ans` is a list containing `adv + 1` elements, each equal to `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` from 0 to `adv`, `i` is `i + 1` such that `1 ≤ i + 1 < len(a)` if the if condition is met, `adv` is greater than 0, `j` is `j + 1` such that `j < adv`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
