The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be the current value of `i` plus 1, and it must still be less than `n`.

Given that `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to increase `i` by 1 again to reflect the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` is updated to `a_i + (i + 1)`; `i` is incremented by 1**
