The code snippet provided initializes the variable `cur` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `counter`) are modified by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` is `a_i + (i + 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`; `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the updated list `a`; `cur` is 0.**
