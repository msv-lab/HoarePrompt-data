Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least one element, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the updated list `a` with the count of `a[i]` decremented by 1 for each processed element, `cur` is the running sum of the decremented counts of the elements in `a` minus `adv` plus `counter[a[i]]`, `cnt` is recalculated as `cnt - adv` if `i > 0`, `ans` is a list containing all the accumulated values based on the condition and the value of `adv` with the new element `a[i - 1] - j - 1` appended if `i > 0`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `adv` is 0 if `i > 0`. If `i` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `cnt`, `ans`, or `adv`.**
