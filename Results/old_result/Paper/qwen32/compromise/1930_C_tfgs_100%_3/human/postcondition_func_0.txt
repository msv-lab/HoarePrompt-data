The function reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It updates each element `a_i` in the list by adding `i + 1` to it, where `i` is the index of the element. It then processes the updated list to produce a new list `ans` that is printed. The final output is a sequence of integers derived from the processed list, ensuring that the sequence is constructed based on the frequencies and values of the updated list elements.
