You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the input format as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program expects the number of test cases `t` and the list of integers for each test case to be provided in a specific way, but it does not correctly parse the input to match the format given in the problem description.

Here are the issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `n = input()`, which is correct.
   - However, for each test case, it reads an extra line `a = input()` that is not needed according to the problem description. This line should be removed.
   - The actual list of integers for each test case is read using `b = input()`, and then split into a list of integers. This part is correct.

2. **Looping Over Test Cases**:
   - The loop `for num in range(int(n)):` is correct for iterating over the test cases.
   - However, the unnecessary line `a = input()` inside the loop causes the program to misinterpret the input, as it expects an additional line between the number of integers `n` and the list of integers for each test case.

3. **Sorting and Summing**:
   - The sorting and summing logic `for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):` is correct. It correctly sums up the smallest values from each pair of integers.

To fix the program, the unnecessary line `a = input()` should be removed. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for _ in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        list2 = []
        a = input().split()  # Read the number of integers and the list in one line
        list1 = [int(x) for x in a]  # Convert the list of strings to a list of integers
        list1.sort()
        for i in range(0, len(list1), 2):
            s = s + int(list1[i])
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)

# Example usage
# func()
```

With this correction, the program should correctly parse the input and produce the correct output for all test cases.
