To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop's behavior and the given output states after the first three iterations.

The loop iterates over each element in `list1`, which is derived from the string `b`. Each element in `list1` is converted to an integer and appended to `list2`. The loop continues until all elements in `list1` have been processed.

Given the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that `list1` contains at least three elements. The loop will continue until all elements in `list1` are processed.

Let's summarize the final output state:

- `t`: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `n`: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `a`: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `final`: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `s`: Remains `0` as it is not modified within the loop.
- `b`: Remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `list2`: Will contain the integer values of all elements in `list1`.
- `num`: Will be `num + len(list1)` as it increments by 1 for each iteration of the loop.
- `list1`: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `list2` will contain the integer values of all substrings in `b`, and `num` will have been incremented by the number of elements in `list1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50, `a` is a string input by the user, `final` is a list containing the value of `s` and the value of `s` appended, `s` is 0, `b` is a string input by the user, `list2` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `list1`, `num` is `num + len(list1)`, `list1` is a list of substrings derived from `b`.**
