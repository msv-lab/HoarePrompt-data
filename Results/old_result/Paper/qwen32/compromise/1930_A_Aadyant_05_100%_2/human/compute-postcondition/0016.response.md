To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand how the loop processes the input string `b` and converts its substrings into integers, appending them to `list2`.

Given the loop:
```python
for str in list1:
    list2.append(int(str))
```

- `list1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string `b` by whitespace.
- The loop iterates over each substring in `list1`, converts it to an integer, and appends it to `list2`.

From the provided output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop continues until all substrings in `list1` are processed. Therefore, after all iterations, `list2` will contain the integer values of all substrings from `b`.

Let's summarize the final state of the variables:

- `t`: Remains unchanged, still an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n`: Remains unchanged, still a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50.
- `a`: Remains unchanged, still a string input by the user.
- `final`: Remains unchanged, still an empty list.
- `s`: Remains unchanged, still 0.
- `list2`: Contains all the integer values of the substrings from `b` split by whitespace.
- `b`: Remains unchanged, still a non-empty string input by the user.
- `list1`: Remains unchanged, still a list of substrings from `b` split by whitespace.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a string input by the user; `final` is an empty list; `s` is 0; `list2` is a list containing the integer values of all substrings from `b` split by whitespace; `b` is a non-empty string input by the user; `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` split by whitespace.**

In natural language: After the loop finishes executing, `list2` will contain all the integer values obtained from the substrings of the input string `b` split by whitespace, while all other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `final`, `s`, `b`, `list1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
