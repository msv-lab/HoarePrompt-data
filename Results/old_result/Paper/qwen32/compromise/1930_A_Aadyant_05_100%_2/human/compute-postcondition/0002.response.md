To determine the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variables in the loop head. The loop head in the given code is:

```python
for num in range(int(n)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variables in the loop head are `num` and `n`. We need to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `int(n)` should be at least 1.

Let's analyze the provided state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50.
- `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
- `final` is an empty list.

The only variables that can be adjusted are `num` and `n`. However, `num` is a loop variable and will be assigned values by the `range` function, so we don't need to adjust it directly. The variable `n` is a string representation of an integer, and we need to ensure that `int(n)` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given that `n` is already described as a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50, it is already in a valid state for the loop to execute. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n` to ensure the loop executes.

The state before the loop starts is already valid for the loop to execute, so no changes are necessary.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7; `final` is an empty list.**
