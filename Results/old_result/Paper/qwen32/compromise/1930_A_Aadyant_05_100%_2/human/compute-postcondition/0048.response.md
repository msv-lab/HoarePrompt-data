The code snippet `final.append(s)` appends the value of `s` to the list `final`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50.
- `a` is a string input by the user.
- `final` is a list containing the value of `s`.
- `s` is the sum of every second element in `list2` starting from index 0.
- `b` is a non-empty string input by the user.
- `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all substrings from `b` split by whitespace.
- `num` is `num + 1`.
- `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` split by whitespace.

After the execution of `final.append(s)`, the list `final` will now contain the value of `s` appended to it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a string input by the user; `final` is a list containing the value of `s` and the value of `s` appended; `s` is the sum of every second element in `list2` starting from index 0; `b` is a non-empty string input by the user; `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all substrings from `b` split by whitespace; `num` is `num + 1`; `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` split by whitespace.**
