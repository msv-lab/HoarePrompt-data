The code snippet provided only initializes a new list `list1` and does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `final`, `s`, and `list2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a string input by the user; `final` is an empty list; `s` is 0; `list2` is an empty list; `list1` is an empty list.**
