The code snippet provided is:
```python
list2.append(int(str))
```
However, there is a mistake in the provided code because `str` is a built-in type in Python and it should not be used as a variable name. Assuming the intention was to use a different variable name, let's assume it was `n` instead of `str` for the purpose of this task.

Given the assumption, the corrected code snippet is:
```python
list2.append(int(n))
```

Now, let's determine the impact of the code on the program:

- `list2` is an empty list initially.
- `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50.

After executing the code:
- `list2` will have one element, which is the integer value of `n`.

The other variables (`t`, `a`, `final`, `s`, `b`, `list1`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a string input by the user; `final` is an empty list; `s` is 0; `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `n`; `b` is a non-empty string input by the user that contains at least one substring separated by whitespace or is a single non-empty substring; `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` split by whitespace and must have at least one element.**
