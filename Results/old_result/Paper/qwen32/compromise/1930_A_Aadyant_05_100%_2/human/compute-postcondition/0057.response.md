The code provided attempts to append an integer value derived from the variable `str` to the list `list2`. However, in the initial state, there is no variable named `str` defined. Based on the provided examples and the context, it seems like there might be a typo, and the intended variable to be converted to an integer and appended to `list2` is actually `n` (which is a string representation of an integer).

Assuming the intention was to use `n` instead of `str`, the code would convert the string `n` to an integer and append it to `list2`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50, `a` is a string input by the user, `final` is a list containing the value of `s` and the value of `s` appended, `s` is 0, `b` is a string input by the user that contains at least one character, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `n`, `num` is `num + 1`, `list1` is a list of substrings derived from `b` that contains at least one element**.

In natural language: The variable `list2` now contains the integer value of `n`. All other variables retain their initial states.
