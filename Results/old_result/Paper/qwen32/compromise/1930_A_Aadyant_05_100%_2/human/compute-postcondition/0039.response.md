Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a string input by the user; `final` is a list containing the value of `s`; `s` is 0; `b` is a non-empty string input by the user; `list2` is a list containing the integer values of all substrings from `b` split by whitespace; `num` is `num + 1`; `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` split by whitespace.** 

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `list2` will contain all the integer values obtained by splitting the string `b` by whitespace. All other variables will remain in their initial states except for `list2`, which will be fully populated with the integer values from `b`.
