### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the number of coins Alice and Bob have in their wallets. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the game dynamics and the optimal strategy for both players.

**Game Dynamics and Strategy:**

1. **Turns and Moves:**
   - Players take turns.
   - In each turn, a player can either swap wallets or not.
   - A player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Optimal Play:**
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they make the best possible move at every step to maximize their chances of winning.
   - The game's outcome essentially depends on the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins (a + b).

3. **Determining the Winner:**
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is **even**, Bob wins.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is **odd**, Alice wins.

**Explanation of the Code:**

- **Function `func_1(a, b)`:**
  - This function takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, representing the number of coins Alice and Bob have, respectively.
  - It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even (`(a + b) % 2 == 0`).
  - If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob', indicating that Bob wins.
  - If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice', indicating that Alice wins.

- **Function `func_2()`:**
  - This function handles reading input and processing multiple test cases.
  - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads the number of coins Alice and Bob have.
  - It calls `func_1(a, b)` for each test case and stores the result.
  - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Conclusion:

The logic implemented in `func_1` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. The function `func_2` correctly handles input and output for multiple test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
