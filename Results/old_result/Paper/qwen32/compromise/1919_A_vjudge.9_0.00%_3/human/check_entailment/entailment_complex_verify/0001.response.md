To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program, we need to systematically analyze the game mechanics, the optimal strategy, and how the program implements this strategy.

### Game Analysis:
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns to either swap wallets or remove one coin from their current wallet. The game ends when a player cannot make a move, and the other player wins. The optimal strategy depends on the parity (even or odd) of the total number of coins:

1. **Game Mechanics**:
   - Players take turns.
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets or not.
   - They must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The game is symmetric, and the optimal strategy depends on the parity (even or odd) of the total number of coins.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob will win if both play optimally.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will win if both play optimally.

### Explanation of the Program:
- The program consists of two functions: `func_1(a, b)` and `func_2()`.
- `func_1(a, b)` determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of coins (a + b).
- `func_2()` handles input and output for multiple test cases.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **func_1(a, b)**:
   - It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'.
   - If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.

2. **func_2()**:
   - It reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`.
   - It calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner.
   - It stores the result and prints it after processing all test cases.

### Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- `func_1(a, b)` correctly checks the parity of the sum of `a` and `b` and returns the appropriate winner based on the parity.
- `func_2()` correctly processes multiple test cases, reads inputs, and prints the results.

### Validation:
Let's validate the program using the provided examples:
1. **Example 1**: `a = 1, b = 1`
   - `a + b = 2` (even)
   - Expected winner: Bob
   - Program output: Bob (Correct)

2. **Example 2**: `a = 1, b = 4`
   - `a + b = 5` (odd)
   - Expected winner: Alice
   - Program output: Alice (Correct)

3. **Example 3**: `a = 5, b = 3`
   - `a + b = 8` (even)
   - Expected winner: Bob
   - Program output: Bob (Correct)

4. **Example 4**: `a = 4, b = 5`
   - `a + b = 9` (odd)
   - Expected winner: Alice
   - Program output: Alice (Correct)

5. **Example 5**: `a = 11, b = 9`
   - `a + b = 20` (even)
   - Expected winner: Bob
   - Program output: Bob (Correct)

6. **Example 6**: `a = 83, b = 91`
   - `a + b = 174` (even)
   - Expected winner: Bob
   - Program output: Bob (Correct)

7. **Example 7**: `a = 1032, b = 9307`
   - `a + b = 10339` (odd)
   - Expected winner: Alice
   - Program output: Alice (Correct)

8. **Example 8**: `a = 839204, b = 7281`
   - `a + b = 846485` (odd)
   - Expected winner: Alice
   - Program output: Alice (Correct)

9. **Example 9**: `a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000`
   - `a + b = 2000000000` (even)
   - Expected winner: Bob
   - Program output: Bob (Correct)

10. **Example 10**: `a = 53110, b = 2024`
    - `a + b = 55134` (even)
    - Expected winner: Bob
    - Program output: Bob (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins, which aligns with the optimal strategy for the game. The annotations confirm that the program behaves as expected at each step.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins, which is the optimal strategy for the game.
Final: **True**
