Let's analyze the provided Python code against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns playing a game with their wallets.
- Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
- After choosing, the player must remove 1 coin from their current wallet.
- The player who cannot make a move loses.
- Both play optimally.

### Key Points:
- The game's outcome depends on the total number of coins (`a + b`).
- If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins.
- If the total number of coins is odd, Alice wins.

### Analysis:
The provided code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: Determines the winner based on the total number of coins.
2. `func_2()`: Handles input and output for multiple test cases.

#### func_1(a, b):
This function checks if the sum of coins (`a + b`) is even or odd and returns 'Bob' or 'Alice' accordingly. This logic aligns with the problem description.

#### func_2():
This function reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and prints the result for each test case. This function also adheres to the problem description.

### Verification:
The provided code correctly implements the logic based on the problem description. It correctly determines the winner based on the sum of the coins in both players' wallets.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code, it appears to be correct for all potential cases as per the problem description.

Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The program correctly determines the winner based on whether the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even or odd. This matches the optimal strategy described in the problem statement. No edge cases were found where the program fails to produce the expected result.
