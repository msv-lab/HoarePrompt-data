Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the minimum number of 5x3 grids (screens) required to place a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates `n` times to process each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` (number of 1x1 icons) and `b` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates `t = b * 2`, which represents the total number of 1x1 cells required to place `b` 2x2 icons (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, but the logic seems to be treating it as if each 2x2 icon occupies 2 cells in a simplified manner).
   - It then calculates the number of screens required to place these 2x2 icons by dividing `t` by 5 (the number of cells in a row of the grid). If there is a remainder, it adds one more screen to accommodate the remaining cells. This part of the logic is incorrect because it does not consider the actual placement of 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid, which can fit up to 2 2x2 icons per screen (not 2.5 as the code suggests).

3. **Calculating Remaining Space for 1x1 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the remaining space on the screens already allocated for 2x2 icons using `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`. This step seems to be an attempt to calculate the remaining cells on the screens but does not accurately reflect the actual remaining space because of the incorrect `t` calculation.
   - It then checks if the remaining space `t1` is sufficient to place all `a` 1x1 icons. If not, it calculates the additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons and adds them to `t`.

Given the logic, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed because:
- It incorrectly calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons.
- It does not accurately calculate the remaining space on the screens for 1x1 icons.

The program's logic for placing 2x2 icons and calculating the remaining space is flawed, leading to incorrect results in many cases.

Correctness: **False**
