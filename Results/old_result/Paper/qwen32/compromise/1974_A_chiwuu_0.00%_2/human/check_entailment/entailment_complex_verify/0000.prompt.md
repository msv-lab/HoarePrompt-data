You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #State: the series of printed values of `t` for each of the `n` test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then calculates and prints a value `t` for each test case based on the given logic, which involves operations including multiplication, division, and conditional checks. The final state of the program is a series of printed values of `t` corresponding to each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for the given problem. Let's analyze the code and find a case where it fails.

The main logic in the code is as follows:
1. Calculate the total number of cells required for 2x2 icons (`t = b * 2`).
2. Calculate the number of screens needed for these 2x2 icons (`t = t // 5 + 1` if `t % 5 != 0`).
3. Calculate the remaining cells available after placing the 2x2 icons (`t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`).
4. If the remaining cells are enough to place the 1x1 icons (`t1 >= a`), then no additional screens are needed.
5. Otherwise, calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

Let's consider a specific test case:
```
Input:
1
14 0

Expected Output:
2

Actual Output:
3
```

Explanation for the test case:
- We have 14 1x1 icons and 0 2x2 icons.
- The code calculates `t = 0 * 2 = 0`, so `t = 0` screens are needed for 2x2 icons.
- The remaining cells available are `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`.
- Since `t1 < 14`, the code calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons: `t2 = 14 - 0 = 14`.
- The number of additional screens needed is `t2 // 15 + 1 = 14 // 15 + 1 = 1`, so the total number of screens is `0 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`.

However, the correct answer should be 2 screens, as 14 1x1 icons can be placed on 2 screens (each screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons).

Thus, the code does not handle all cases correctly, and the correctness is **False**.
