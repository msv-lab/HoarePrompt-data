You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/d2faa6ca73d70e765c2cc6ef0834e24c2e4a5528.png)
Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

        print(j)
        
    #State: The loop prints each string in the `answers` list sequentially, resulting in the same list `answers` with values 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a number of test cases and for each test case, it processes six integers representing the dimensions of a rectangle and the coordinates of two points within that rectangle. It then determines and prints whether a player named Alice or Bob wins or if the game is a Draw based on the positions of the points and the rules defined in the code.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game for all possible cases. There are several issues and missing logic in the program that need to be addressed:

1. **Alice's and Bob's Movement Logic:** The program does not correctly implement the movement logic for both players. Alice can move down, down-left, or down-right, while Bob can move up, up-left, or up-right. The program incorrectly uses conditions involving the parity of the row positions to determine the winner, which does not accurately reflect the movement rules.

2. **Edge Cases:** The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example:
   - If Alice is in the last row (`x_a = h`), she cannot make any moves, and the game should end in a draw.
   - If Bob is in the first row (`x_b = 1`), he cannot make any moves, and the game should end in a draw.
   - The program does not correctly handle scenarios where Alice and Bob are in the same column but different rows, or vice versa.

3. **Simplification of the Problem:** The problem can be simplified by considering the relative positions of Alice and Bob. If Alice can reach Bob's position before Bob can reach Alice's position, Alice wins. If Bob can reach Alice's position before Alice can reach Bob's position, Bob wins. If neither can reach the other, the game is a draw.

Here is an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
3 3 1 1 3 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Draw
```

**Explanation of the Case:**
- Alice starts at (1, 1) and Bob starts at (3, 3).
- Alice can move to (2, 1), (2, 2), or (2, 3).
- Bob can move to (2, 3), (2, 2), or (2, 1).
- Regardless of Alice's move, Bob can always move to the same cell in his next turn, and vice versa.
- Therefore, neither player can win, and the game ends in a draw.

The provided program does not correctly handle this scenario and would likely output an incorrect result. Thus, the program is incorrect.
