The code snippet reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `test_cases`. This integer represents the number of test cases that will follow. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and the value of `t` is what will be read into `test_cases`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `test_cases` <= 10^4.**
