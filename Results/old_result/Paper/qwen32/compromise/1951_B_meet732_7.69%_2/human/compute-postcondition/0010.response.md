Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers where the first element `t` represents the number of test cases. Each test case is represented by two parts: the first part is a list `[n, k]` where `n` is the number of cows and `k` is your cow's 1-based index, and the second part is a list of `n` integers `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]` representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with all `a_i`'s being pairwise different. `x` is assigned the value `a[k]` for each test case. `ind` is a list containing the indices of up to two cows whose ratings are higher than `x`. `c` is the count of such cows, which can be 0, 1, or 2. If `k` is 14, the current value of `k` is 14. Otherwise, the value of `k` remains unchanged. `ind` is not an empty list, meaning there is at least one cow whose rating is higher than `x`.**
