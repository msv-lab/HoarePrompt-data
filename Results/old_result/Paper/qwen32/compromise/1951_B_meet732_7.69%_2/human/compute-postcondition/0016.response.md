Output State: **The program returns the index of the cow with a higher rating than `x`, adjusted by subtracting 1 from it. Given that `ind[0]` is greater than `k` and `ind[0]` is not equal to 0, the returned value is `ind[0] - 1`, which is a valid index of a cow whose rating is higher than `x`.**

In simpler terms, the program returns the position (0-based) of the cow with a higher rating than your cow, after adjusting the index by subtracting 1.
