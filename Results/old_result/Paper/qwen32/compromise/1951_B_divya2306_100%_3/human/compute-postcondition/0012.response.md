To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the expression step by step using the given initial state:

1. **Variables and their states:**
   - `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged.
   - `wins` remains unchanged.
   - `win_with_swap` is defined as the count of elements in `a` from index `win_with_swap` to `k-2` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]`, plus the initial `wins + 1`.

2. **Expression to evaluate:**
   ```
   print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)))
   ```

3. **Step-by-step evaluation:**

   - **Term 1: `wins - 1`**
     - This is simply the value of `wins` minus 1.
   
   - **Term 2: `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)`**
     - `win_with_swap` is the count of elements in `a` from index `win_with_swap` to `k-2` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]`, plus the initial `wins + 1`.
     - So, `win_with_swap - wins - 1` simplifies to the count of elements in `a` from index `win_with_swap` to `k-2` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]`.
     - Adding `(wins != 0)` will add 1 to the expression if `wins` is not zero, otherwise, it adds 0.

4. **Combining the terms:**
   - The `max` function will return the larger of the two terms evaluated above.
   - The exact numerical value cannot be determined without the specific values of `wins` and the elements in `a` from index `win_with_swap` to `k-2`, but we can describe the expression precisely.

5. **Final Output Description:**
   - The `print` statement will output the maximum of two values:
     - `wins - 1`
     - The count of elements in `a` from index `win_with_swap` to `k-2` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]`, plus 1 if `wins` is not zero.

Given the information, the exact numerical value cannot be determined, but the expression can be described precisely.

Output: **max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)) (where win_with_swap is the count of elements in `a` from index `win_with_swap` to `k-2` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]`, plus the initial `wins + 1`)**
