You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

    1 1
    
    1 4
    
    5 3

    1000000000 1000000000
    
    53110 2024

Output

    Bob
    Alice
    Bob

    Bob
    Alice
    Alice

    Bob
    
Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) indicating the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns playing a game.
- Each turn, a player can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
- Then, the player must remove 1 coin from their current wallet.
- The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., when their wallet has 0 coins) loses.
- Both players play optimally.
- Determine who will win given the initial number of coins in each player's wallet.

### Program Analysis:
The program provided is:
```python
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

### Key Points:
- The program checks if the sum of coins in both wallets (`a + b`) is even or odd.
- If the sum is even, it outputs "Bob".
- If the sum is odd, it outputs "Alice".

### Strategy:
The strategy here is based on the observation that the game can be reduced to a simple parity check:
- If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins.
- If the total number of coins is odd, Alice wins.

### Correctness Verification:
To verify the correctness, let's analyze the logic:
- If the total number of coins is even, the players will alternate turns until all coins are gone, and since Alice goes first, Bob will make the last move, thus winning.
- If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will be able to make the last move, thus winning.

### Testing with Examples:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:
1. `1 1` -> Total = 2 (even) -> Bob wins.
2. `1 4` -> Total = 5 (odd) -> Alice wins.
3. `5 3` -> Total = 8 (even) -> Bob wins.
4. `4 5` -> Total = 9 (odd) -> Alice wins.
5. `11 9` -> Total = 20 (even) -> Bob wins.
6. `83 91` -> Total = 174 (even) -> Bob wins.
7. `1032 9307` -> Total = 10339 (odd) -> Alice wins.
8. `839204 7281` -> Total = 846485 (odd) -> Alice wins.
9. `1000000000 1000000000` -> Total = 2000000000 (even) -> Bob wins.
10. `53110 2024` -> Total = 55134 (even) -> Bob wins.

All the provided examples match the expected outcomes based on the parity of the total number of coins.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct for all the provided test cases and the logic seems sound based on the game's rules and the optimal play strategy.

**Correctness: True**.
