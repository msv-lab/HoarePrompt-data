Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a logical error in the calculation of the minimum number of screens required. Specifically, the line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect because it attempts to adjust `x` based on an incorrect assumption about the space occupied by the `2x2` icons. 

Here is a breakdown of the issues:
- The program calculates `bxsfory` as the number of screens needed to place the `2x2` icons, but it does not correctly account for the remaining space on those screens.
- The adjustment to `x` is incorrect because it assumes that each `2x2` icon occupies 15 cells, which is not the case. Each `2x2` icon occupies 4 cells, and the remaining cells on a screen after placing `2x2` icons need to be correctly considered for placing `1x1` icons.

A correct approach would be to first place as many `2x2` icons as possible on each screen, and then place the remaining `1x1` icons in the leftover space. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        screens = 0
        
        # Place as many 2x2 icons as possible
        while y > 0:
            # Each screen can hold at most 6 (2x2) icons
            icons_to_place = min(y, 6)
            screens += 1
            y -= icons_to_place
            # Calculate remaining space after placing 2x2 icons
            remaining_space = 15 - icons_to_place * 4
            # Place 1x1 icons in the remaining space
            x -= remaining_space
            if x < 0:
                x = 0
        
        # Place remaining 1x1 icons
        if x > 0:
            screens += math.ceil(x / 15)
        
        print(screens)

func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that the `2x2` icons are placed first, and the remaining space is used for `1x1` icons, correctly calculating the minimum number of screens required.
