To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the context of the variables involved.

**Initial State:**
- `s1` is unchanged.
- `pre` is unchanged.
- `totalOne` is 0.
- `preOne` is an empty list.
- `suffZero` is a list of `n` cumulative sums of indices of '<' characters from the end to the start.
- `ans` is a list of computed values based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters.

**Key Points to Consider:**
- The `ans` list contains computed values, but the specific computation method is not detailed in the initial state.
- The `print(*ans)` statement will print all elements of the `ans` list separated by spaces.

**Output Analysis:**
Since the exact computation of `ans` is not provided, we can only describe it in terms of its definition. The `ans` list is computed based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters in some string or list (which is likely `s1` based on the context).

**Conclusion:**
The output will be the elements of the `ans` list, which are computed values based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters. Without the exact computation, we can't provide the numerical values, but we can describe the output in terms of the `ans` list.

Output: **[elements of ans] (where ans is a list of computed values based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters)**
