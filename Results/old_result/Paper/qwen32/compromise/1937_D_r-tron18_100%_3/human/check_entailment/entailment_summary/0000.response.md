### Reasoning:

The problem requires computing the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position, based on the rules provided. The solution involves two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. Here's the detailed breakdown:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the difference between the time at which the pinball leaves the grid from the last cell and the time at which it leaves from the cell that is `times + 1` positions from the end of the list `arr`.
   - It is a utility function that helps in calculating specific differences in accumulated times.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is the main driver of the solution.
   - It processes the string `s1` to compute the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
   - It maintains two lists:
     - `pre`: Indices of cells containing '>' characters.
     - `suffZero`: Accumulated sums of indices of cells containing '<' characters, computed in reverse.
   - It uses these lists to compute the time for each cell based on the rules provided.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Initialization**:
  - `pre` is a list of indices where the character is '>'.
  - `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters.
  - `preOne` is the accumulated sum of indices in `pre`.
  - `suffZero` is initialized with a single element 0.
  - `ans` is the result list that will store the time for each cell.

- **Processing**:
  - The function iterates over the string from right to left.
  - For each cell:
    - If the character is '>', it calculates the time based on the counts and accumulated sums of '<' and '>' characters.
    - If the character is '<', it updates `suffZero` and recalculates the time similarly.
  - The calculations involve using `func_1` to get specific differences in accumulated times.

- **Output**:
  - The function prints the final computed times for each cell.

### Correctness:
- The logic in `func_2` correctly handles the movement of the pinball and the inversion of characters.
- The use of accumulated sums (`preOne` and `suffZero`) and the utility function `func_1` ensures that the computations are efficient and meet the problem requirements.
- The provided execution summaries match the expected behavior of the functions, and the output hints suggest that the functions are correctly computing the required values.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
