You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

def func_1():

    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))

- Annotated Code:

for i in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n], and all p_i are distinct.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (n == 2) :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
    else :
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
            
        #State: the loop completes all iterations without printing anything, and the values of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `v` remain unchanged.
        print(3)
        #This is printed: 3
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n], and all p_i are distinct; `v` is a list of n + 1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining n elements are the integers read from the input. If `n` is 2, the conditions on `t`, `n`, `p`, and `v` remain as specified, and no additional changes occur. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `v` remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not account for all possible scenarios where the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least two friends attend the party may be different from 2 or 3.

Let's analyze the program:

1. **Handling `n == 2`**: The program correctly prints `2` for `n == 2` because in this case, Monocarp must invite both friends to ensure at least two friends attend.

2. **Checking for Triangles**: The program then checks if there exists a triplet `(i, v[i], v[v[i]])` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If such a triplet is found, it prints `2` because inviting two members of this triplet ensures that two friends attend the party.

3. **Default Case**: If no such triplet is found, the program defaults to printing `3`.

However, the program does not correctly handle all possible cases where the minimum number of invitations required could be more than 2 but less than 3. For example, consider the following test case:

```
4
4
2 3 4 1
```

In this case, Monocarp can invite friends 1 and 2. Friend 1 and friend 2 will attend because they are each other's best friends, and both have invitations. Friend 3 and friend 4 will not attend because their best friends (friend 4 and friend 1, respectively) do not have invitations. Thus, the minimum number of invitations required is 2.

The program will incorrectly print `3` for this case because it does not find a triplet `(i, v[i], v[v[i]])` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases correctly.
