You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n], and all p_i are distinct.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (n == 2) :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
    else :
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
            
        #State: the loop completes all iterations without printing anything, and the values of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `v` remain unchanged.
        print(3)
        #This is printed: 3
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n], and all p_i are distinct; `v` is a list of n + 1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining n elements are the integers read from the input. If `n` is 2, the conditions on `t`, `n`, `p`, and `v` remain as specified, and no additional changes occur. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `v` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a list `v` of `n` integers from the input, where each integer `v_i` is distinct, satisfies `1 <= v_i <= n`, and `v_i` is not equal to `i` for any `i` in the range [1, n]. It then checks if there exists any `i` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If such an `i` exists, it prints `2` and exits. If no such `i` exists after checking all possibilities, it prints `3`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
Monocarp needs to send invitations to his friends such that at least two of them attend the party. A friend will attend if they and their best friend both receive invitations. The task is to determine the minimum number of invitations needed.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p`.
   - The best friends list `p` is stored in a 1-based index list `v` by prepending a `0` to the input list.

2. **Special Case for n = 2**:
   - If `n` is 2, the program correctly prints `2` because both friends must be invited to ensure at least two friends attend.

3. **Checking for Triangular Relationships**:
   - For `n > 2`, the program checks if there exists a triplet `(i, v[i], v[v[i]])` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. This condition identifies a cycle of length 3 in the best friend relationships.
   - If such a triplet is found, the program prints `2` because inviting two friends in this triplet ensures that two friends attend.

4. **Default Case**:
   - If no such triplet is found, the program defaults to printing `3`. This is based on the assumption that in the absence of a cycle of length 3, inviting three friends is necessary to ensure at least two attend.

### Correctness Evaluation:

The program correctly handles the special case for `n = 2` by inviting both friends.

For `n > 2`, the program correctly identifies the scenario where a cycle of length 3 exists and correctly invites two friends in such a cycle to ensure two friends attend. 

However, the default case of printing `3` when no cycle of length 3 is found is not always correct. There are scenarios where it is possible to ensure at least two friends attend by inviting fewer than three friends, especially when there are smaller cycles or other configurations that allow two friends to attend with fewer invitations.

### Counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
1
4
2 3 4 1
```
In this case, sending invitations to friends `1` and `2` will ensure that both `1` and `2` attend the party, as `1`'s best friend is `2` and `2`'s best friend is `3`. However, the program will print `3` because it does not find a cycle of length 3.

### Conclusion:
The program is not always correct due to the incorrect handling of cases where fewer than three invitations are needed.

**Correctness: False**
