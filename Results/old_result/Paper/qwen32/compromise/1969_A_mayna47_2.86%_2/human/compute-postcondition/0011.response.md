Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and a list `v` of `n` integers from the input, where each integer `v_i` is distinct, satisfies `1 <= v_i <= n`, and `v_i` is not equal to `i` for any `i` in the range [1, n]. It then checks if there exists any `i` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If such an `i` exists, it prints `2` and exits. If no such `i` exists after checking all possibilities, it prints `3`.**
