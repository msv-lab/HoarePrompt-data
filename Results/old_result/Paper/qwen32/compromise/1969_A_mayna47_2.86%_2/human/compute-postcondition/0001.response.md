The code initializes a list `v` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n], and all p_i are distinct; `v` is a list of n + 1 integers, all initialized to 0.**
