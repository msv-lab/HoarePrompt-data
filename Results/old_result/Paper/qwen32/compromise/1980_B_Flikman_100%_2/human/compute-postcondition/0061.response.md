Output State: **`t` is the integer input by the user and is now `t - 1`; `n` is the first integer input by the user in the new input; `f` is the second integer input by the user in the new input; `k` is the third integer input by the user in the new input; `a` is the new list of integers provided by the user; `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`; `sorted_a` is the list `a` sorted in descending order; `removed_count` is 0; `favorite_count` is not recalculated and thus may not reflect the new list `a`.**

In this state, `removed_count` has been set to 0, while all other variables retain their previously assigned values.
