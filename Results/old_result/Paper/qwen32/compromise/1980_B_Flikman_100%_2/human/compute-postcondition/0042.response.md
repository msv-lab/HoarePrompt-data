The code snippet `removed_count += 1` increments the value of `removed_count` by 1. Given that the initial state specifies `removed_count` is 2 if the current element of `sorted_a` at index `i` is equal to `favorite_value`, otherwise `removed_count` is 1, the new value of `removed_count` will be either 3 or 2 incremented by 1, resulting in 3.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is the integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer input by the user, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`, `sorted_a` is the list `a` sorted in descending order, `removed_count` is 3, `favorite_count` is undefined, `i` is 2**.
