Postcondition: **`t` is the integer input by the user and must be greater than 0; `n`, `f`, and `k` are the three integers input by the user, where `k` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers provided by the user; `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`; `sorted_a` is the list `a` sorted in descending order. If the current element of `sorted_a` at index `i` is equal to `favorite_value`, `removed_count` is set to 2. Otherwise, `removed_count` remains 0; `i` is the current index + 1. `removed_count` is either 0 or 2.**
