Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer input by the user; `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    favorite_value = a[f - 1]
    sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)
    removed_count = 0
    for i in range(k):
        if sorted_a[i] == favorite_value:
            removed_count += 1
    favorite_count = sorted_a.count(favorite_value)
    if removed_count == favorite_count:
        print('YES')
    elif removed_count == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the integer input by the user and must be greater than 0; `n`, `f`, and `k` are the three integers input by the user; `a` is a list of integers provided by the user; `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`; `sorted_a` is the list `a` sorted in descending order; `removed_count` is the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`; `favorite_count` is the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`. If `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`, the condition holds as specified. Otherwise, `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count`, and if `removed_count` is 0, it remains 0; otherwise, `removed_count` is not equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the integer input by the user and must be greater than 0; `n` is an integer input by the user; `k` is an integer input by the user; `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user; `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`; `sorted_a` is the list `a` sorted in descending order; `removed_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`; `favorite_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the entire `sorted_a` list. If `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`, then `removed_count` equals `favorite_count`. Otherwise, `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count`. If `removed_count` is 0, it remains 0 and is still not equal to `favorite_count`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the integer input by the user minus 1; `n` is the first integer input by the user in the new input; `f` is the second integer input by the user in the new input; `k` is the third integer input by the user in the new input; `a` is the new list of integers provided by the user; `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`; `sorted_a` is the list `a` sorted in descending order; `removed_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`; `favorite_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the entire list `sorted_a`; `i` is `k - 1`. If `removed_count` equals `favorite_count`, it indicates that `favorite_value` appears the same number of times in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a` as it does in the entire list `sorted_a`. Otherwise, `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count`, and if `removed_count` is 0, `favorite_value` does not appear in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`; if `removed_count` is not 0, it represents the actual count of `favorite_value` in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
