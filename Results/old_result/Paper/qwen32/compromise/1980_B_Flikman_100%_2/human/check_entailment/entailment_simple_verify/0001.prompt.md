You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of cubes.
     - `f`: Index of Dmitry's favorite cube.
     - `k`: Number of cubes removed.
     - `a`: List of values on the cubes.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output "YES" if the favorite cube is always removed, "NO" if it is never removed, or "MAYBE" if it could be either removed or left.

3. **Logic:**
   - Determine the value of the favorite cube.
   - Sort the list of cube values in non-increasing order.
   - Count how many cubes with the favorite value are removed when the first `k` cubes are removed.
   - Determine the total number of cubes with the favorite value.
   - If all cubes with the favorite value are removed, output "YES".
   - If none of the cubes with the favorite value are removed, output "NO".
   - Otherwise, output "MAYBE".

### Program Analysis:
The program follows the logic described above. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, `k`, and the list `a`.

2. **Identifying the Favorite Cube:**
   - The value of the favorite cube is stored in `favorite_value`.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The list `a` is sorted in non-increasing order and stored in `sorted_a`.

4. **Counting Removed Cubes:**
   - It counts how many cubes with the favorite value are in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a` and stores this count in `removed_count`.

5. **Counting Total Favorite Cubes:**
   - It counts the total number of cubes with the favorite value in `sorted_a` and stores this count in `favorite_count`.

6. **Determining the Output:**
   - If `removed_count` equals `favorite_count`, it prints "YES".
   - If `removed_count` is 0, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "MAYBE".

### Correctness Check:
- The logic is correct for determining whether the favorite cube is always removed, never removed, or could be either removed or left.
- The program correctly handles the sorting and counting of favorite cubes.
- The program correctly interprets the conditions and outputs the appropriate result for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.

**Correctness:** **True**
