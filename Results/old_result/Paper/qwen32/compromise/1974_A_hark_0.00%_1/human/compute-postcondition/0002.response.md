To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to analyze the provided loop and the initial state. The loop is defined as:

```python
for _ in range(t):
    func_2()
```

Here, `t` is the integer value provided by the user, and `func_2()` is a function that gets called `t` times.

The loop head `for _ in range(t):` indicates that the loop will iterate `t` times. The variable `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we do not plan to use. The body of the loop, `func_2()`, suggests that some function named `func_2` is called during each iteration of the loop.

Since the problem does not specify what `func_2()` does, and there are no other variables in the loop head or body that are modified, the only change in the state will be the execution of `func_2()` `t` times. The value of `t` itself will not change, and no other variables are mentioned as being affected by the loop.

Output State: **`t` remains the integer value provided by the user, and `func_2()` has been executed `t` times.**
