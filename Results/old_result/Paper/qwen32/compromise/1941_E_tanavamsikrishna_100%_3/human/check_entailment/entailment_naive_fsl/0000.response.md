Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum total cost of installing supports for the bridges. The main issue lies in the `func_1` function, which is supposed to calculate the minimum cost for a single row, and the overall logic in `func_2` for calculating the total cost for `k` consecutive rows.

Here are the specific issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the minimal cost of installing supports in a single row such that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports does not exceed `d`. However, the logic used in `func_1` does not correctly handle the constraints and does not ensure that the minimum cost is calculated accurately.
   - The function initializes the first `d` elements and then uses a min-heap to try and find the minimal cost for the rest of the row. However, the way it handles the heap and the indices does not guarantee that the minimal cost is computed correctly, especially considering the constraints on the distance `d`.

2. **Incorrect Summation in `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` calculates the total cost for `k` consecutive rows by summing the individual row costs. However, it does not correctly handle the constraints and does not ensure that the minimal cost for `k` consecutive rows is computed accurately.
   - The function simply sums the costs of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum sum. This approach does not consider the possibility that the minimal cost might involve different choices of supports in each row, which could lead to a lower total cost.

3. **Example of Incorrectness:**
   - Consider the following test case:
     ```
     1
     3 5 2 2
     0 1 2 1 0
     0 2 1 2 0
     0 1 2 1 0
     ```
     - The correct output should be `6` (by placing supports at positions (2, 2) and (3, 2) for the first row, and (1, 2) and (2, 2) for the second row).
     - The provided program might output a different value due to the incorrect logic in `func_1` and `func_2`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required logic and fails to handle certain edge cases, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
