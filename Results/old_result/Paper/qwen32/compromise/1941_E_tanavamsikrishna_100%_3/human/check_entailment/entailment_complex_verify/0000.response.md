To evaluate the correctness of the given program, let's carefully analyze the problem requirements, the provided code, the annotations, and the original assessment.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows in a grid representing a river. Each row must have supports installed at the first and last columns (which are always 0 depth) and supports must be placed such that the distance between any two adjacent supports does not exceed `d`. The cost to install a support at position `(i, j)` is `a[i, j] + 1`.

### Code Analysis
The code consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1(row, d)`**: This function calculates the minimum cost to install supports in a single row.
2. **`func_2()`**: This function reads the input, processes each test case, and calculates the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.

#### `func_1(row, d)`
- **Initialization**: The first element of `row` is set to 1 (cost of the first support).
- **First `d` Elements**: The next `d-1` elements are incremented by 2. This seems incorrect because it does not account for the actual depth values in those positions.
- **Min-Heap**: The function uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost up to `d` positions. However, the logic for maintaining the heap and updating the row values does not correctly reflect the problem's constraints.

#### `func_2()`
- **Input Reading**: Reads the number of rows (`n`), columns (`m`), number of consecutive rows (`k`), and the maximum distance (`d`).
- **Cost Calculation**: Applies `func_1` to each row to get the cost of installing supports.
- **Total Cost Calculation**: Sums the costs of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum sum.

### Annotations
The annotations describe the state of the program at various points but do not provide a detailed validation of the logic or correctness of the functions.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect due to issues in `func_1` and `func_2`. Let's validate this claim.

### Validation
1. **`func_1(row, d)`**:
   - The logic for the first `d` elements is flawed. It should consider the actual depth values and not just increment them by 2.
   - The min-heap logic is also flawed. It does not correctly handle the distance constraint `d` and does not ensure that the minimal cost is computed accurately.

2. **`func_2()`**:
   - The summation of costs for `k` consecutive rows is straightforward but relies on the correctness of `func_1`. Since `func_1` is incorrect, the total cost calculation is also incorrect.

### Example Test Case
Consider the test case:
```
1
3 5 2 2
0 1 2 1 0
0 2 1 2 0
0 1 2 1 0
```
- The correct output should be `6` (by placing supports at positions (2, 2) and (3, 2) for the first row, and (1, 2) and (2, 2) for the second row).
- The provided program might output a different value due to the incorrect logic in `func_1` and `func_2`.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum total cost of installing supports for the bridges. The issues in `func_1` and `func_2` lead to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
