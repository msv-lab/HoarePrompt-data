### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for bridges over a river grid, with certain constraints. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the given program and how it addresses the problem:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the grid (`n` rows and `m` columns), the number of bridges (`k`), the maximum distance between supports (`d`), and the depth values of each cell in the grid.

2. **Cost Calculation for Each Row**: The `func_1` function calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row of the grid. It ensures that:
   - A support is installed at the first and last positions of the row.
   - The cost of installing a support at position `j` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.
   - The distance between any two adjacent supports does not exceed `d`.

   The function uses a min-heap to efficiently find the minimum cost for installing supports while adhering to the distance constraint `d`.

3. **Total Cost Calculation for Multiple Rows**: The `func_2` function calculates the total cost for building bridges over `k` consecutive rows. It does this by:
   - Calculating the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - Summing up the costs for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
   - Finding the minimum of these sums.

4. **Output**: For each test case, the program outputs the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows.

### Verification:

- **Correctness of `func_1`**: The function correctly calculates the minimum cost for installing supports in a single row while ensuring that the distance constraint `d` is respected. It uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost within the window of `d` cells, which is a valid approach.

- **Correctness of `func_2`**: The function correctly calculates the total cost for building bridges over `k` consecutive rows by summing up the costs of each row and finding the minimum sum among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the minimum total cost of installing supports for bridges over the river grid while adhering to all constraints.

### Correctness: **True**
