Output State: **`row[0]` is 1, `row[i]` for `i` in the range [1, d-1] is increased by 2 compared to its initial value, `row[i]` is `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, `min_heap` is `[(e), (row[i], i)]`, `d` is less than `len(row)`, `i` is at least `2d + 1`.**

Natural language: The `min_heap` now contains an additional element `(row[i], i)`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
