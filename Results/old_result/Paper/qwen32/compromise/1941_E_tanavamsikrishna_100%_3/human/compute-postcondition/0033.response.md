To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition inside the loop head:

```python
while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop condition involves:
1. `heappop(min_heap)`: This operation removes and returns the smallest item from the heap `min_heap`.
2. `e[1]`: This accesses the second element of the tuple `e` returned by `heappop`.
3. `i - (d + 2)`: This is a comparison value derived from `i` and `d`.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, the condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` must be `True` after the first `heappop` operation.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `i` is `i + 1`

We need to adjust `min_heap`, `i`, and `d` such that the condition holds. Let's break it down:

1. **`min_heap`**: Since `heappop(min_heap)` will return the smallest item, we need to ensure that the smallest item's second element (`e[1]`) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.
2. **`i`**: We know `i` is `i + 1` right before the loop, but we need to ensure the condition holds with this value.
3. **`d`**: This variable needs to be adjusted such that `i - (d + 2)` is greater than or equal to the second element of the smallest tuple in `min_heap`.

Let's assume the smallest item in `min_heap` is `(x, y)`. For the loop to execute, `y` must be less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

Let's denote:
- The smallest item in `min_heap` as `(x, y)`.
- `i` as `i + 1` (given).

To ensure the loop executes, we need:
\[ y \leq (i + 1) - (d + 2) \]
\[ y \leq i - d - 1 \]

To make this condition true, we can set:
- `min_heap` to contain at least one tuple `(x, y)` such that `y` is less than or equal to `i - d - 1`.
- `d` to be adjusted accordingly.

Since `i` is `i + 1` right before the loop, let's assume `i` was `i` initially, so `i + 1` means the current `i` is one more than its previous value.

Let's set:
- `min_heap` to `[(x, y)]` where `y` is less than or equal to `i - d - 1`.
- `d` to be such that the condition holds.

For simplicity, let's assume `i` was initially `5` (so `i` right before the loop is `6`), and let's set `d` to `2`. Then:
\[ y \leq 6 - 2 - 1 \]
\[ y \leq 3 \]

So, we can set `min_heap` to `[(x, 3)]` or any value of `y` that satisfies the condition.

Therefore, the adjusted state can be:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `min_heap` contains at least one tuple `(x, y)` where `y` is less than or equal to `i - d - 1`, `d` is adjusted such that the condition holds**

For a concrete example:
State: **`i` is 6, `min_heap` is `[(x, 3)]`, `d` is 2**

This ensures that the loop condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` is `True` and the loop executes at least once.
