The given code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into four parts, converting each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` respectively. The initial state specifies that `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers with specific roles, and `rows` is a 2D list of integers.

The code does not modify `rows` or any other variables not explicitly mentioned in the input line. Therefore, the only variables that change are `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, and they take on the values provided by the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers read from the input, representing the number of rows, number of columns, number of consecutive rows for building bridges, and maximum distance between supports respectively; `rows` is a 2D list of integers representing the depth of the river cells with dimensions `n` x `m`, and the first and last elements of each row in `rows` are 0.**
