The code snippet `prime_to_i *= prime` updates the value of `prime_to_i` by multiplying it with the value of `prime`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `prime_to_i` was previously `prime_to_i * prime`. After executing the code, `prime_to_i` becomes `prime_to_i * prime * prime`, which simplifies to `prime_to_i * prime**2`.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer representing Vasya's position in the line, `x` is a positive integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling such that 1 <= x < n, `k` is not equal to the length of the list `primes`, `rest` is an empty list, `prime` is the value of `primes[k]`, `prime_to_i` is `prime_to_i * prime**2`, `factors[prime]` is 0, and a value `factor * prime_to_i` has been returned.**
