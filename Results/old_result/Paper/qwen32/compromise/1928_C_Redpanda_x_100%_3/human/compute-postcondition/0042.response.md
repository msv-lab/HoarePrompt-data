Postcondition: **k is a non-negative integer, n is a positive integer representing Vasya's position in the line, and x is a positive integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling such that 1 <= x < n. If k equals the length of the list primes, a value of 1 has been yielded. Otherwise, k is not equal to the length of the list primes; rest is an empty list; prime is the value of primes[k]; prime_to_i is prime * prime; factors[prime] is 0; and the loop has finished executing all iterations.**
