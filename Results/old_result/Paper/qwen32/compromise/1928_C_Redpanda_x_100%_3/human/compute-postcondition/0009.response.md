The code snippet `prime_to_i *= prime` multiplies the current value of `prime_to_i` by the value of `prime`. Given that `prime_to_i` was initially 1 and `prime` is a prime number, `prime_to_i` will now be equal to `prime`.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer representing Vasya's position in the line, `x` is a positive integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling such that 1 <= x < n, and `k` is not equal to the length of the list primes; `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty list; `prime` is the value of `primes[k]`; `prime_to_i` is `prime`; `factors[prime]` is 0; a value of `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.**
