To determine if the provided program is correct based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine how many values of `k` (where `k > 1`) fit the given constraints for the position `n` and the number `x` that Vasya received.
   - The sequence of numbers repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - For a given `k`, the sequence starts from `1` to `k`, then decreases back to `2`, and repeats.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The provided code includes two functions: `func_1` and `generate`.
   - `func_1` is supposed to factorize a number `n` and generate all possible factors.
   - `generate` recursively generates all possible products of the prime factors of `n`.

3. **Issues with the Code:**
   - The code does not address the problem of finding `k` based on the given `n` and `x`.
   - The code is attempting to factorize `n` and generate all its factors, which is not directly related to finding the correct `k`.
   - The `generate` function uses a global variable `primes` and `factors`, which are not defined within the scope of the function.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve the problem, we need to determine the values of `k` such that the position `n` in the sequence corresponds to the number `x`.
   - The sequence repeats every `2k - 2` positions, so we need to find the correct `k` that fits this pattern.
   - For a given `k`, the sequence is `1, 2, ..., k, k-1, ..., 2, 1, 2, ...`. We need to find the position of `x` in this sequence and check if it matches the given `n`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. It attempts to factorize `n`, which is not relevant to finding the correct `k`.
   - The code is missing the logic to determine the correct `k` based on the given `n` and `x`.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
