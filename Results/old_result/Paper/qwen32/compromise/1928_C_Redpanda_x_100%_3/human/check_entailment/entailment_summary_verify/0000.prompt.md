You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    factors = {}
    nn = n
    i = 2
    while i * i <= nn:
        while nn % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            nn //= i
        i += 1
    if nn > 1:
        factors[nn] = factors.get(nn, 0) + 1
    primes = list(factors.keys())

    for factor in generate(0):
        yield factor

#Function 2:
def generate(k):
    if k == len(primes):
        yield 1
    else:
        rest = generate(k + 1)
        prime = primes[k]
        for factor in rest:
            prime_to_i = 1
            for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
                yield (factor * prime_to_i)
                prime_to_i *= prime



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `generate` is a recursive generator that yields all possible products of the form \( p_1^{e_1} \times p_2^{e_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{e_k} \), where \( p_i \) are prime numbers and \( e_i \) are non-negative integers up to a specified limit. The function takes a single parameter `k`, which indicates the current index in the list of primes, and it yields values based on the recursive generation of these products.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The problem requires determining the number of different values of \( k \) such that for a given position \( n \) and a number \( x \), \( x \) is the number assigned to the position \( n \) in the described settling pattern.

The provided code seems to be related to factorization and generating factors of a number, which does not align with the problem requirements. The code does not contain any logic to determine the settling pattern or to check if a given \( k \) fits the criteria for the position \( n \) and number \( x \).

To solve the problem correctly, we would need to implement logic that:
1. Iterates over possible values of \( k \).
2. Generates the settling pattern for each \( k \).
3. Checks if the number \( x \) is assigned to position \( n \) in the pattern.
4. Counts the number of valid \( k \) values.

Since the provided code does not perform these steps, it is incorrect.
