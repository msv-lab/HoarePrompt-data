Reasoning:

To determine the winner of the game, we need to analyze the game's mechanics and the players' optimal strategies.

1. **Game Mechanics**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first.
   - In each turn, a player can choose to swap wallets or not.
   - After the choice, a player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move (i.e., when both wallets are empty) loses.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The key to solving the problem lies in the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins (a + b).
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob will always win if both play optimally. This is because Alice can always mirror Bob's moves, ensuring that Bob is always the one left with the last coin.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, Alice will always win. This is because Alice can make a move that leaves an even number of coins for Bob, and then mirror his moves, ensuring that she is the one left with the last coin.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets `a` and `b`.
   - It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the optimal strategy for determining the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
