Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. It then prints 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, and 'Alice' if the sum is odd.**
