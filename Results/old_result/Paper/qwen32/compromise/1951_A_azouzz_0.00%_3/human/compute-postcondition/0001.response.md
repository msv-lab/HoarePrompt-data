In the given for loop, the loop head only involves the variable `t`, which determines the number of iterations the loop will execute. The variables `start` and `end` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute at all. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` must be greater than 0**
