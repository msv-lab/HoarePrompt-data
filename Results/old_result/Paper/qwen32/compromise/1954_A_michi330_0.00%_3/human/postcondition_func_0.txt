The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. For each test case, it determines whether it is possible to repaint up to `k` parts of a ribbon with `n` parts using `m` colors, under the condition that not all parts are repainted and the number of parts not repainted is at least the ceiling of `n` divided by `m`. It outputs 'YES' if the condition is met and 'NO' otherwise.
