Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input and must have at least 2 elements; `same` is 2; `num` is `ar[0]`; `minn` is `inf`; `i` is 1; `ar[i]` equals `num`**

In this output state, the variable `same` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables retain their initial values.
