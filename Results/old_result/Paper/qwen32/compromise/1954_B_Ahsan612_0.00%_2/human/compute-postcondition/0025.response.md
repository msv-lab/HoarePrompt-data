To ensure that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that the condition `i < len(ar)` remains true after the previous iteration. The variables `i` and `ar` are the ones that appear in the loop head, so we can only adjust these.

From the state provided:
- `i` is 4 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, otherwise `i` is 5.
- `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements.

To proceed with another iteration, `i` must be less than the length of `ar`. Since `ar` has at least 4 elements, the smallest possible length of `ar` is 4. However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` should be less than the length of `ar`.

Let's consider the two cases for `i`:
1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 4. For the loop to execute again, `len(ar)` must be greater than 4.
2. If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `i` is 5. For the loop to execute again, `len(ar)` must be greater than 5.

Since we need to ensure the loop can execute one more time in both scenarios, we should choose the stricter condition, which is `len(ar) > 5`.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than 5.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with more than 5 elements, `minn` is 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 4 and `same` is 3. Otherwise, `i` is 5 and `same` is 1.**
