To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the loop head condition `i < len(ar)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `len(ar)`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `same` is 1.
- `num` is `ar[0]`.
- `minn` is `inf`.
- `i` is 1.

The loop condition `i < len(ar)` must be true for the loop to execute. Since `i` is already 1, `len(ar)` must be greater than 1 to satisfy the condition.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `ar` to ensure it has more than one element.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[0]`; `minn` is `inf`; `i` is 1**
