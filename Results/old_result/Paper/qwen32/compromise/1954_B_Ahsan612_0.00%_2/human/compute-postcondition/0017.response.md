To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition, which is `i < len(ar)`. The variables `i` and `len(ar)` are the only ones that can be adjusted based on the loop head.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements
- `i` is 3
- `num` is `ar[2]`
- `same` is 2 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`; otherwise, `same` is 1
- `minn` is 1

The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`. Since `i` is currently 3, `len(ar)` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

No other variables in the loop condition need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `num` is `ar[2]`, `same` is 2 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`; otherwise, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1**
