The code snippet updates the variable `minn` to be the minimum value between its current value and the value of `same`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input and must have at least `i + 2` elements; `i` is now `i + 1` and must be less than `len(ar) - 1`; `same` is unchanged; `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`; `num` is `ar[i]`.**
