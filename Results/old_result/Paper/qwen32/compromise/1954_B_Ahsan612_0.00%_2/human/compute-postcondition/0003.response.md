The code snippet provided only initializes a variable `same` to the value `1`. It does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `ar`. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `ar` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `same` is 1**.
