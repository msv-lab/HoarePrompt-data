The code snippet `num = ar[i]` assigns the value of `ar[i]` to the variable `num`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `num` is updated to the value of the third element in the list `ar` (since list indices start at 0).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[2]`; `minn` is `inf`; `i` is 2; `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`**

In simpler terms, the value of `num` is now the third element of the list `ar`. All other variables remain unchanged.
