The code snippet `n = int(input())` will assign the value of the new input integer to the variable `n`. The variable `n` was previously defined as the new input integer minus 1. After executing this code, the value of `n` will be updated to the new input integer directly, without subtracting 1.

The other variables `t`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input; `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive numbers in `ar`; `num` is the last unique number encountered in `ar`; `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`, where `minn` is `inf` if no valid minimum has been found yet; `i` is `len(ar)`**.
