Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[2]`; `minn` is `inf`; `i` is 2; `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`**

Explanation: The value of `num` has been updated to `ar[i]`, which is `ar[2]` since `i` is 2. All other variables retain their initial values.
