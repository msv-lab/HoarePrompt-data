The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` sets `minn` to the minimum value between its current value (`inf`) and `same` (which is 1). Therefore, `minn` will be updated to 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input and must have at least 2 elements; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[2]`; `minn` is 1; `i` is 2; `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`**.
