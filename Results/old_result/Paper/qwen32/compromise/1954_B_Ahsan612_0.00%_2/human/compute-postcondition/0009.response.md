The code snippet `same += 1` increments the value of the variable `same` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Initially, `same` is 1, so after the increment, `same` becomes 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `same` is 2; `num` is `ar[0]`; `minn` is `inf`; `i` is 1; `ar[i]` is equal to `num`**.
