Let's break down the given initial state and determine the value of `minn` that will be printed.

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000. This variable does not directly affect the calculation of `minn`.
- `n` is an input integer, which represents the number of elements in the list `ar`.
- `ar` is a list of integers.
- `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of the last number in `ar` if it is the same as the previous one, otherwise 1.
- `num` is the last number in `ar`.
- `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`. Initially, it is not set to infinity, so it must have been set to some value before this point in the code.
- `i` is equal to the length of `ar`.

Since `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`, we need to understand the context in which `minn` was initially set and how `same` is calculated.

1. `same` is calculated based on the consecutive occurrences of the last number in `ar`. If the last number is the same as the previous one, `same` will be incremented; otherwise, it will be set to 1.
2. `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `same`.

Given that `minn` is not initially set to infinity, it must have been set to some value before this point, likely the length of the list or some other relevant value. However, without more context, we can only describe `minn` in terms of its relationship with `same`.

Since `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of the last number in `ar`, `same` will be at least 1. Therefore, `minn` will be the minimum of its previous value and this count.

Given the information provided, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **minn (where minn is the minimum of its previous value and the count of consecutive occurrences of the last number in `ar`)**
