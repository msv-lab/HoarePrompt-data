The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 3, so the new value of `i` is 4. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input and has more than 3 elements; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[2]`; `minn` is 1; `i` is 4**.
