The code snippet `same += 1` increments the value of `same` by 1. Given the initial state, `same` is either 3 or 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 3, and after the increment, `same` becomes 4. Otherwise, `same` is 1, and after the increment, `same` becomes 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `minn`, `i`, and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with more than 5 elements, `minn` is 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 4 and `same` is 4. Otherwise, `i` is 5 and `same` is 2.**
