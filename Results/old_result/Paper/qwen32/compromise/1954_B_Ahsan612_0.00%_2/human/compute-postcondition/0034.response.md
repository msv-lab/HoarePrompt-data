The code updates the variable `minn` by comparing it with the value of `same` and taking the minimum of the two. This means that `minn` will be the smaller value between its current value and `same`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers; `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of the last number in `ar` if it is the same as the previous one, otherwise 1; `num` is the last number in `ar`; `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`; `i` is equal to the length of `ar`.**

In simple terms, `minn` has been updated to be the smaller value between its previous value and `same`. All other variables remain unchanged.
