The line of code `same = 1` assigns the value `1` to the variable `same`. This does not affect any other variables or the preconditions given. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[2]`; `minn` is 1; `i` is 2; `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`**.
