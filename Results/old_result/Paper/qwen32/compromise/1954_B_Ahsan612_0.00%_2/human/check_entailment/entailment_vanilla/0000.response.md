Reasoning:
The given program aims to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array in order for it to stop being beautiful. The program iterates through each test case, processes the array, and determines the minimum number of elements that need to be removed.

Here's the step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, the program initializes `same` to 1 and `num` to the first element of the array. It also initializes `minn` to infinity, which will store the minimum length of any contiguous segment of identical elements found in the array.

2. **Iteration through the array**: The program iterates through the array starting from the second element. It checks if the current element is the same as `num`. If it is, it increments `same`. If not, it updates `minn` with the minimum of its current value and `same`, then resets `same` to 1 and updates `num` to the current element.

3. **Final check**: After the loop, the program updates `minn` one last time to ensure the last segment of identical elements is considered. If `minn` is still infinity, it means the array has only one element, and the program outputs -1. Otherwise, it outputs `minn`.

However, there's a critical flaw in the logic. The program is designed to find the minimum length of a contiguous segment of identical elements, which is not necessarily the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The correct approach should involve identifying the longest sequence of elements that can be made uniform through the described operation and then determining the minimum removals required to break this sequence.

For example, in the case of the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program would incorrectly output `1` because the smallest segment of identical elements is of length `1`. However, to make the array non-beautiful, we need to remove at least `3` elements to break the sequence of `3`s.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
