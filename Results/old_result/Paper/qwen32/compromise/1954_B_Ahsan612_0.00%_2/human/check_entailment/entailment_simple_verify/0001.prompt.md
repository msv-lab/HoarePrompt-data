You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1

    #State: For each test case, the output will be the minimum length of consecutive occurrences of any number in the array `ar`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The given program aims to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array in order for it to stop being beautiful. The program iterates through each test case, processes the array, and determines the minimum number of elements that need to be removed.

Here's the step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, the program initializes `same` to 1 and `num` to the first element of the array. It also initializes `minn` to infinity, which will store the minimum length of any contiguous segment of identical elements found in the array.

2. **Iteration through the array**: The program iterates through the array starting from the second element. It checks if the current element is the same as `num`. If it is, it increments `same`. If not, it updates `minn` with the minimum of its current value and `same`, then resets `same` to 1 and updates `num` to the current element.

3. **Final check**: After the loop, the program updates `minn` one last time to ensure the last segment of identical elements is considered. If `minn` is still infinity, it means the array has only one element, and the program outputs -1. Otherwise, it outputs `minn`.

However, there's a critical flaw in the logic. The program is designed to find the minimum length of a contiguous segment of identical elements, which is not necessarily the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The correct approach should involve identifying the longest sequence of elements that can be made uniform through the described operation and then determining the minimum removals required to break this sequence.

For example, in the case of the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program would incorrectly output `1` because the smallest segment of identical elements is of length `1`. However, to make the array non-beautiful, we need to remove at least `3` elements to break the sequence of `3`s.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
