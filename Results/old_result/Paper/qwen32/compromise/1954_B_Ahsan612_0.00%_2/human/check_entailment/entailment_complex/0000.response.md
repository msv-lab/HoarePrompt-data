### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a "beautiful" array to make it no longer beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if, by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` whenever `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`, all elements can eventually be made the same.

The provided program calculates the minimum length of consecutive occurrences of any number in the array. This approach is based on the observation that if we can identify a segment of the array that has the smallest number of consecutive identical elements, removing all but one element from that segment will ensure that the array is no longer beautiful.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:
1. For each test case, the program reads the length of the array `n` and the array `ar` itself.
2. It initializes `same` to 1, `num` to the first element of the array, and `minn` to infinity.
3. It iterates through the array, counting consecutive occurrences of the same number.
4. Whenever it encounters a different number, it updates `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and `same` (the count of consecutive occurrences of the previous number).
5. After the loop, it performs a final update to `minn` to account for the last segment of consecutive numbers.
6. If `minn` is still infinity (which shouldn't happen given the problem constraints), it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

This approach is correct because:
- Removing all but one element from the shortest segment of consecutive identical elements will ensure that the array is no longer beautiful.
- The program efficiently computes the required value in linear time for each test case, which is suitable given the problem constraints.
