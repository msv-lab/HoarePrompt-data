Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. Each integer `p_i` in the list `p` satisfies the conditions 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` != `i`. The function returns a result for each test case based on these inputs, but the specific return value or computation is not detailed in the provided information.**
