The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This line of code will take an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 50`. After the execution of this line, the value of `n` will be updated to the integer provided by the user input, and it will still satisfy the condition `2 <= n <= 50` as per the precondition.

The other variables `t` and `p` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` != `i`.**
