Reasoning:
The program attempts to solve the problem by checking if there exists a trio of friends (i, p_i, p_p_i) such that p_p_i = i. If such a trio exists, it means that sending invitations to two friends (i and p_i) will result in both of them coming to the party, thus minimizing the number of invitations to 2. If no such trio exists, the program defaults to sending invitations to three friends, which is guaranteed to bring at least two friends to the party due to the problem constraints.

Let's analyze the given program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list `p` of best friends.
3. If `n` is 2, it immediately prints 2, which is correct because with only two friends, you need to invite both to ensure both come.
4. For `n > 2`, it checks if there exists a trio of friends (i, p_i, p_p_i) such that p_p_i = i. If found, it prints 2.
5. If no such trio is found after checking all possibilities, it prints 3.

The logic for `n == 2` is correct. For `n > 2`, the logic of checking for a trio (i, p_i, p_p_i) such that p_p_i = i is also correct because if such a trio exists, sending invitations to the two friends i and p_i will ensure both come to the party. If no such trio exists, the program defaults to sending invitations to three friends, which is the worst-case scenario and is guaranteed to bring at least two friends to the party.

The execution states provided in the comments also align with the logic of the program. For the given examples, the program correctly prints the minimum number of invitations required.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided execution states, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
