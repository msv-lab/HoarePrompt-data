The provided program is not correctly implementing the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the problem and the code to understand why.

### Problem Understanding
Kirill wants to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue with the minimum cost. He can swap with any person in front of him, paying `a[j]` coins to swap with the person at position `j` and `b[k]` coins to each person between `j` and `i` (where `i` is Kirill's current position and `j < k < i`).

### Code Analysis
The current implementation incorrectly calculates the minimum cost. Here's a detailed analysis of the code:

```python
numCasos = int(input())
for i in range(numCasos):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pergunta = float('inf')
    func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m)

def func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m):
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
        
    print(pergunta)
```

#### Issues in the Code
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**:
   - The code incorrectly calculates the cost by summing the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from `n-1` to `0`. This doesn't account for the specific cost structure where you pay `a[j]` to swap with person `j` and `b[k]` for each person between `j` and `i`.
   - The cost should be calculated based on the specific positions Kirill swaps with, not just the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

2. **Logic for Swapping**:
   - The logic does not correctly simulate the process of Kirill swapping with people in front of him. It does not keep track of the exact sequence of swaps or the cost associated with each swap.

3. **Initialization of `pergunta`**:
   - `pergunta` is initialized to `float('inf')`, which is correct, but the way it is updated is incorrect as explained above.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the process of Kirill moving to one of the first `m` positions by considering the cost of each possible swap and the cost of moving past people between the swap positions.

Here is a corrected version of the function that should work:

```python
def func_1(a, b, n, m):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
    dp[n] = 0
    
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        for j in range(i + 1, min(i + m + 1, n + 1)):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + a[i] + sum(b[i + 1:j]))
    
    print(dp[0])

numCasos = int(input())
for i in range(numCasos):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(a, b, n, m)
```

### Conclusion
The original program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
