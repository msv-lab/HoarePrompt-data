You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in line. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate this minimum cost, but it does not do so accurately.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates from the end of the queue to the beginning, and it attempts to calculate the minimum cost to move Kirill to a position less than `m`. However, the logic inside the loop is flawed.
   - The line `pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])` is intended to update the minimum cost to move Kirill to a position less than `m`. However, `x` is not correctly accumulating the cost of bribing people between `j` and `i`.
   - The line `x += min(a[i], b[i])` is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the cost of bribing people between `j` and `i`. Specifically, `x` should accumulate the cost of bribing all people between `j` and `i`, not just the minimum cost of bribing the `i-th` person.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where `m` is 1, meaning Kirill needs to be at the front of the queue. In such cases, the cost would be the sum of the minimum costs of bribing all people in front of him.
   - The code does not handle cases where `m` is equal to `n`, meaning Kirill can stay at the end of the queue without any cost.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to use a more sophisticated approach that considers the cost of bribing people between `j` and `i` and ensures that Kirill can move to a position less than `m` with the minimum cost.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import heapq

def min_cost_to_front(n, m, a, b):
    # Min-heap to store the minimum cost to bribe people
    min_heap = []
    total_cost = 0
    
    # Iterate from the end of the queue to the beginning
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m - 1:
            # If we need to move Kirill to a position less than m
            total_cost += heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        else:
            # Add the cost of bribing the current person to the heap
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, min(a[i], b[i]))
    
    return total_cost

numCasos = int(input())
for i in range(numCasos):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(min_cost_to_front(n, m, a, b))
```

This corrected version uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum costs of bribing people and ensures that Kirill can move to a position less than `m` with the minimum cost.
