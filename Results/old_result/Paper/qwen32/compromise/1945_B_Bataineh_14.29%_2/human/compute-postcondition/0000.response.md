The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Given the initial state where `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), after executing the code, `t` will be updated to the integer value provided by the input. The other variables `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input value such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq a, b, m \leq 10^{18}\).**
