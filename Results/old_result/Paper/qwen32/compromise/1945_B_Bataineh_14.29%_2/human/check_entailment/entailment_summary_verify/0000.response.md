### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not accurately compute the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. The code's logic is flawed, particularly in the handling of cases where `m` is not less than `a` or `b`. The function summary provided aligns with the code's behavior, but this behavior is incorrect based on the problem description.

Let's revisit the counterexample provided in the original assessment:

**Test Case:**
```
1
2 3 4
```

**Analysis:**
- The first installation launches fireworks every 2 minutes: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...
- The second installation launches fireworks every 3 minutes: 3, 6, 9, 12, ...
- Each firework is visible for 5 minutes (from the launch time to `launch_time + m` inclusive).

**Visibility Timeline:**
- At time 2: Only the first firework is visible.
- At time 3: Only the second firework is visible.
- At time 4: First firework launched at time 2 is visible.
- At time 5: First firework launched at time 2 is visible.
- At time 6: First firework launched at time 2 and second firework launched at time 3 are visible. Also, the first firework launched at time 4 is visible.
- At time 7: First firework launched at time 4 is visible.
- At time 8: First firework launched at time 6 is visible.
- At time 9: Second firework launched at time 6 is visible.
- At time 10: First firework launched at time 8 is visible.
- At time 11: First firework launched at time 8 is visible.
- At time 12: First firework launched at time 6 and second firework launched at time 9 are visible. Also, the first firework launched at time 10 is visible.

From the timeline, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 3, not `m // a + m // b + 2` which evaluates to `4 // 2 + 4 // 3 + 2 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5`.

The logic in the code does not account for overlaps correctly. It simply adds the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the `m` duration and adds 2, which is incorrect as it does not consider the simultaneous visibility of fireworks from both installations.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The code does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
