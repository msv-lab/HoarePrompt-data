### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated version to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a`.
- Alice appends her picks to `c` and deletes them from `a`.
- Bob deletes his picks from `a`.
- The goal is to determine the MEX of `c` after all elements from `a` are processed, with both players playing optimally.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Sorting and Counting**:
   - The program sorts the array `N` and uses a dictionary `M` to count occurrences of each number.
   - This approach is useful for determining the MEX in a static array but does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob.

2. **Finding MEX**:
   - The program initializes `cur` to `-1` and iterates through the sorted numbers.
   - If a number is greater than `cur + 1`, it means `cur + 1` is missing, so it breaks out of the loop.
   - If the number is equal to `cur + 1`, it increments `cur` and continues.
   - After the loop, if all numbers up to `cur` are present and counted appropriately, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - Finally, it checks if any number `i` from `0` to `cur` is not present or not counted enough times, and sets `cur` to that number.

3. **Handling Optimal Play**:
   - The program does not explicitly simulate the turns of Alice and Bob.
   - It assumes that the sorted order and counting will give the correct MEX, which is not necessarily true due to the alternating turns and the different strategies of Alice and Bob.

#### Issues Identified:
- **Optimal Play Simulation**: The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob, which is crucial for determining the MEX based on their optimal strategies.
- **Handling Duplicates**: The program does not correctly handle the case where numbers are duplicated and need to be counted multiple times in the context of the game.
- **Final MEX Calculation**: The logic for determining the final MEX is flawed. It does not correctly account for the optimal moves of both players.

#### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly simulate the optimal play of both players and does not correctly calculate the MEX based on the rules of the game.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
