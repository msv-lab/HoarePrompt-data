Let's analyze the given program and compare it to the problem requirements and the provided execution states.

### Key Points in the Problem Description:
1. **Game Mechanics**: Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a` and building array `c`. Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c` while Bob wants to minimize it.
2. **MEX Definition**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.
3. **Optimal Play**: Both players play optimally, meaning they make the best possible move at each step.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `S` (which is `n` in the problem statement) and an array `N` of integers.
2. **Sorting**: The array `N` is sorted.
3. **Tracking Elements**: A dictionary `M` is used to count occurrences of each number in the sorted array.
4. **Determining MEX**:
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to `-1`.
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N`. If the current number is greater than `cur + 1`, it sets `cur` to `cur + 1` and breaks out of the loop (this means `cur + 1` is the smallest missing number).
   - If the current number is equal to `cur + 1`, it increments `cur` and adds the number to the dictionary `M`.
   - If the current number is already counted in `M`, it increments the count.
5. **Final Adjustment**: If the sum of counts in `M` equals `S` (the size of the array), it increments `cur` by 1.
6. **Finding the MEX**: The program checks if there is an `i` such that `M[i] <= i`. If such an `i` exists, it sets `cur` to `i`. Otherwise, `cur` remains the last incremented value.
7. **Output**: The program prints the final value of `cur` for each test case.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:
- **Optimal Strategy**: The program does not explicitly simulate the turns between Alice and Bob. Instead, it calculates the MEX based on the sorted array and counts of elements. This approach implicitly considers the optimal strategy because the MEX calculation inherently reflects the smallest missing number, which is what Alice aims to maximize and Bob aims to minimize.
- **Handling Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles cases where the array contains duplicates and where the array is already sorted in a way that directly leads to the MEX.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the MEX of the array `c` based on the elements of `a` and the rules of the game. It does so efficiently and correctly, even without simulating the turns explicitly.

**Correctness: True**
