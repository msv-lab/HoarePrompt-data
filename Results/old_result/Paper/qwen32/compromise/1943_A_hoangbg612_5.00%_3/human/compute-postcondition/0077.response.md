Postcondition: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `M` is a dictionary, `num` is the next element in `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, `M` has the entry `cur: 1`, `cur` is set to `num`, and if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is increased by 1 and the flow breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cur` or the flow does not break. If `num` is not greater than `cur`, the count of `num` in `M` is incremented by 1.**
