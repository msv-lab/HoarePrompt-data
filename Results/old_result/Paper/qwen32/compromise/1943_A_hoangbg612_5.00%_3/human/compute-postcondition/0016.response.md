The code snippet `M[cur] += 1` attempts to increment the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. However, since `M` is initially an empty dictionary and `cur` is -1, the key `-1` does not exist in `M`. This will raise a `KeyError` because you cannot use `+=` on a key that is not present in the dictionary without first initializing it.

Given the problem constraints and the fact that the code will raise an error, we will assume that the intention was to initialize the key if it doesn't exist. If we were to handle this gracefully, we would need to initialize `M[cur]` to 0 before incrementing it. However, since the code as provided will raise an error, we will describe the state as it would be if the error were handled.

Assuming the error is handled and `M[cur]` is initialized to 0 before the increment, the output state would be:

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers that has at least 1 integer; `cur` is -1; `M` is a dictionary with `M[-1]` equal to 1; `num` is less than or equal to `cur`**

In natural language: The value associated with the key `-1` in the dictionary `M` is now `1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
