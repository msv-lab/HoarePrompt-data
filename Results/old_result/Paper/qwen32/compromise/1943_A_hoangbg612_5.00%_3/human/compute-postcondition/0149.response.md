The execution of the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only terminates the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, the values of `cur` and `i` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.

Output State: **`cur` is equal to the incremented value of `i`, `i` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
