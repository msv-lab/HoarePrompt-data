Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers; `cur` is the last number in `N` that was greater than the previous `cur` value; `M` is a dictionary containing the count of each unique number in `N`. The sum of the counts of all unique numbers in `M` equals `S`.**
