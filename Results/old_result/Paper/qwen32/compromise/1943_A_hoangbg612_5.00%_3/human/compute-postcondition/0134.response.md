The code snippet `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the value of `cur` is now the same as `num`.

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input and must have at least one element; `S` is an input integer; `M` is a dictionary; `num` is the next element in the list `N` after the current `num`; `cur` is now equal to `num`.**
