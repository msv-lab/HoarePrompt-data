Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers that has at least 1 integer; if `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num` and `M` is a dictionary with the key `num` having the value `1`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is updated to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1. If `num` is less than or equal to `cur`, `cur` remains -1 and `M` is a dictionary with `M[-1]` equal to 1.**
