The given code snippet is `cur += 1`, which increments the value of the variable `cur` by 1. The initial state does not specify the value of `cur`, so we will denote the new value of `cur` as `cur + 1`.

The other variables `N`, `S`, `M`, and `num` are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input and must have at least one element; `S` is an input integer; `M` is a dictionary; `num` is the next element in the list `N` after the current `num`; `cur` is `cur + 1`.**
