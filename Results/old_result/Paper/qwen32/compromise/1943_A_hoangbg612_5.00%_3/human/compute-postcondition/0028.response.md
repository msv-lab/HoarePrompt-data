Output State: **`T` is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers that has at least 2 integers; `num` is the next integer in `N`; `cur` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

**Natural Language Explanation:** The values of `T`, `S`, `N`, `num`, and `cur` remain as specified in the initial state, except `cur` has been incremented by 1. The execution of the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
