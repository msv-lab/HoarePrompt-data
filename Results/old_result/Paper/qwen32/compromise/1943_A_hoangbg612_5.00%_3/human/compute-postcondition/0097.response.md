Output State: **`N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, the last number processed in `N` is at least 0, `M` is a dictionary with keys as consecutive integers starting from the smallest number in `N` and values as their counts in `N`, `S` is an input integer, and `cur` is 0, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `cur`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
