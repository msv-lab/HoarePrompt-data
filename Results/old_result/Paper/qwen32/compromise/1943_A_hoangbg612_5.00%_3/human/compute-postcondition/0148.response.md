The value of `cur` is updated to be equal to the value of `i`. The initial state specifies that `i` is incremented by 1 before the code snippet, so `cur` now holds the value that `i` had after being incremented. The precondition that `cur` must be greater than 0 is still valid, assuming `i` was greater than 0 before the increment.

Output State: **`cur` is equal to the incremented value of `i`, `i` is incremented by 1**.
