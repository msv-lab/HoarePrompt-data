The code snippet `cur += 1` increments the value of the variable `cur` by 1. The other variables (`N`, `S`, `M`, `num`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input and must have at least one element; `S` is an input integer; `M` is a dictionary; `num` is the next element in the list `N`; `cur` is incremented by 1.**
