To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head involves the variable `num` and the list `N`.

Given the loop:
```python
for num in N:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `N` is a non-empty list. The variable `num` will take on the values of the elements in `N` one by one during each iteration.

Let's analyze the provided state:
- `T` is `T-1`: This doesn't directly affect the loop execution as `T` is not in the loop head.
- `S` is an input integer: This also doesn't directly affect the loop execution as `S` is not in the loop head.
- `N` is the sorted list of integers from the input: This is relevant because the loop iterates over `N`.
- `cur` is -1: This doesn't directly affect the loop execution as `cur` is not in the loop head.
- `M` is an empty dictionary: This doesn't directly affect the loop execution as `M` is not in the loop head.

For the loop to execute, `N` must be a non-empty list. The current state does not specify whether `N` is non-empty, so we need to adjust this.

### Adjusted State:
- `T` is `T-1`: (remains unchanged)
- `S` is an input integer: (remains unchanged)
- `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element: (adjusted)
- `cur` is -1: (remains unchanged)
- `M` is an empty dictionary: (remains unchanged)

State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `cur` is -1, `M` is an empty dictionary**
