Output State: **T is greater than 0; S is an input integer; N is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; cur is 0; M is an empty dictionary; num is greater than cur; the current value of cur is 0 and num is greater than 0; num is greater than cur + 1 (which is 1) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
