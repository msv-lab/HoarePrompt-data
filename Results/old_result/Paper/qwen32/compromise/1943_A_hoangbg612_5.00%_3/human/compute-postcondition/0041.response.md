Output State: **`T` is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers; `cur` is equal to `i`; the current value of `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `T`, `S`, `N`, `cur`, and `M[i]` remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that it exits the most internal loop or if statement.
