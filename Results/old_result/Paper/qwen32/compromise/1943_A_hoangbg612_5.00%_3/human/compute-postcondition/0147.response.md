The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cur`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these two variables. Since `cur` must be greater than 0 and the loop iterates over `i` in the range of `cur`, `i` should be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `cur` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be less than `cur`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, we need to adjust `i` to be the next value in the sequence.

Given that `cur` is greater than 0, we need to ensure that `i` is incremented correctly. If `M[i]` was not less than or equal to `i` in the previous iteration, `cur` would not have been set to `i` and the loop would have continued. Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1 to proceed to the next iteration.

State: **`cur` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1**
