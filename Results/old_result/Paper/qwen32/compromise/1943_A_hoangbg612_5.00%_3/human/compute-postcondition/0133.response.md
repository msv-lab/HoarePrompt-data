Postcondition: **`N` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input and must have at least one element; `S` is an input integer; `M` is a dictionary; `num` is the next element in the list `N` after the current `num`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is incremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cur`, `N`, `S`, or `M`.**
