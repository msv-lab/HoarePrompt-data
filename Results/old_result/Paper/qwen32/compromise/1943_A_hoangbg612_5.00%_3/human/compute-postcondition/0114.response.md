Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input and must have at least one element; `S` is an input integer; `M` is an empty dictionary; `cur` is 0; `num` is an integer such that `num > cur`. The current value of `cur` is 0, and `num` is greater than 0, and `num` is greater than `cur + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, changing its value from -1 to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
