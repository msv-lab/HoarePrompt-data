Postcondition: **`N` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input and must have at least one element; `S` is an input integer; `M` is a dictionary; `num` is the next element in the list `N` after the current `num`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, `M` maps `cur` to `1` and `cur` is updated to `num`. Otherwise, `M` increments the value of `cur` by 1.**
