Output State: **`T` is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers; `cur` is equal to `i + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `cur` is updated to be equal to `i`, and since `i` was previously `i + 1`, `cur` is now equal to `i + 1`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
