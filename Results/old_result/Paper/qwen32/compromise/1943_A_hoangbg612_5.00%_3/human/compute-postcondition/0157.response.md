Output State: **The final value of `cur` will be the smallest integer `i` such that `M[i] <= i`, if such an `i` exists after all iterations. If no such `i` exists after all iterations, `cur` remains unchanged from its initial value for the last iteration.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `cur` will be the smallest index `i` for which the count of `i` in the list `N` is less than or equal to `i`. If no such index is found after all iterations, `cur` will retain its value from the last iteration.
