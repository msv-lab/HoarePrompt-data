Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `cur` is either -1 or 0; `M` is an empty dictionary; `num` is greater than `cur`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is updated to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1.**
