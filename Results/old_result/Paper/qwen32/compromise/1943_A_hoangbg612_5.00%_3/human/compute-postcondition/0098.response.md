Postcondition: **`N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, the last number processed in `N` is at least 0, `M` is a dictionary with keys as consecutive integers starting from the smallest number in `N` and values as their counts in `N`, `S` is an input integer, and `cur` is 0 if `M[i] <= i`, otherwise `cur` remains greater than 0. `i` is 0. If `M[i] <= i`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else conditions.
