You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        i -= 1
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list `arr` of integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500, and an integer `n` such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500 representing the length of the list `arr` plus one. It returns a list `ans` of `n` elements where `ans[i]` is `10 - arr[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-2` and `ans[n-1]` is `10`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find an array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) that satisfies the given conditions. Specifically, the function `func_1` is incorrectly calculating the values of the array \( a \).

The function `func_1` initializes an array `ans` with all elements set to \( 10^9 \), which is a valid upper bound for \( a_i \). However, it then attempts to set each element \( a_i \) (except the last one) to \( a_{i+1} - x_i \). This logic is flawed because it does not ensure that \( a_i \mod a_{i-1} = x_i \).

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 1
```

**Expected Output:** An array \( a \) such that:
- \( a_2 \mod a_1 = 1 \)
- \( a_3 \mod a_2 = 1 \)

One possible correct output could be:
```
2 3 4
```

However, the given program would likely produce an incorrect result. Let's see why:
- The function initializes `ans` as `[1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000]`.
- It then sets `ans[1] = ans[2] - arr[1] = 1000000000 - 1 = 999999999`.
- Next, it sets `ans[0] = ans[1] - arr[0] = 999999999 - 1 = 999999998`.

This results in `ans = [999999998, 999999999, 1000000000]`, which does not satisfy the conditions:
- \( 999999999 \mod 999999998 \neq 1 \)
- \( 1000000000 \mod 999999999 \neq 1 \)

Thus, the program is incorrect because it fails to generate an array \( a \) that meets the required conditions for all test cases.
