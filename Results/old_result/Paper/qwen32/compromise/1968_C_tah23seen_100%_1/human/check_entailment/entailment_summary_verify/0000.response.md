### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to construct an array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) such that:
  - \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \) for all \( 1 \le i \le n \).
  - \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).
- We are given an array \( x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n \) and need to find such an array \( a \).

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code initializes an array `ans` with all elements set to \( 10^9 \) and then iteratively sets each element \( a_i \) (except the last one) to \( a_{i+1} - x_i \). This approach does not ensure that the conditions \( a_i \mod a_{i-1} = x_i \) are met.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary provided does not match the actual implementation of `func_1`. According to the summary, the function calculates `ans[i]` as `10 - arr[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-2` and sets `ans[n-1]` to `10`. However, the actual code does not follow this logic.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find an array \( a \) that satisfies the given conditions. The function `func_1` indeed does not ensure that \( a_i \mod a_{i-1} = x_i \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

To satisfy the conditions, a possible approach is to set \( a_1 \) to a large number (like \( 10^9 \)) and then set each subsequent \( a_i \) such that \( a_i = k \cdot a_{i-1} + x_i \) for some integer \( k \). This ensures that \( a_i \mod a_{i-1} = x_i \).

For example, for the test case:
```
1
3
1 1
```
A correct output could be:
```
2 3 4
```
Here:
- \( 3 \mod 2 = 1 \)
- \( 4 \mod 3 = 1 \)

The given program does not generate such an array and instead sets values in a way that does not satisfy the required conditions.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the provided program is incorrect. The function `func_1` does not correctly generate the array \( a \) that satisfies the given conditions.

#### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
