Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

The task is to construct an array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that:
- Each `a_i` satisfies `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`.
- For each `i` from 2 to `n`, `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i`, where `x_i` is given in the input.

The provided program attempts to construct such an array `a` using the function `func_1(arr, n)`. However, the function's logic does not correctly satisfy the conditions of the problem. Here's why:

The function `func_1` initializes the array `ans` with `10^9` for all elements. Then, it iterates from the second last element to the first element of `ans`, setting `ans[i]` to `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`. This approach does not guarantee that the constructed array `a` will satisfy `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `i` from 2 to `n`.

In fact, the provided execution summary also indicates that the function is incorrectly setting `ans[i]` to `10 - arr[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-2` and `ans[n-1]` to `10`, which further confirms the incorrectness of the logic.

Let's consider the example given in the problem statement:
For the input `4 2 4 1`, the program would output something like `[999999998, 999999996, 999999995, 10]` (assuming it follows the incorrect logic described in the execution summary), which does not satisfy the conditions `a_2 % a_1 = 2`, `a_3 % a_2 = 4`, and `a_4 % a_3 = 1`.

A correct approach would involve setting `a_1` to a value that is larger than `x_2` (to ensure `a_2 % a_1 = x_2`), and then setting subsequent `a_i` values in a way that satisfies the given modulo conditions. One possible way to construct such an array is to set `a_1` to `x_2 + 1` and `a_i` to `x_i + a_{i-1}` for `i` from 2 to `n`.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
