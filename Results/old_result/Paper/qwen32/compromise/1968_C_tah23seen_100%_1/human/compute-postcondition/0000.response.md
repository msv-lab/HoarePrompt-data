The code initializes a list `ans` with `n` elements, each set to `10 ** 9`. This operation does not affect the values of `arr` or `n`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each element x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500 representing the length of the list `arr` plus one; `ans` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `10 ** 9`.**
