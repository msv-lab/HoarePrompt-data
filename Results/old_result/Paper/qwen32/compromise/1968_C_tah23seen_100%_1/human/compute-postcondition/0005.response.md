The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 3`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0. Since `i` is currently `n - 3`, the loop will execute one more time as long as `n - 3 >= 0`, which simplifies to `n >= 3`. 

Since the problem states that `2 <= n <= 500`, `n` can be 2, which would make `i` equal to `-1` and the loop would not execute again. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 3 to make `i` equal to `n - 3` and still satisfy `i >= 0`.

Thus, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 3. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each element \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \); `n` must be at least 3; `ans` is a list of `n` elements where `ans[i]` is `10 - arr[i]` and all other elements are `10`; `i` is `n - 3`**
