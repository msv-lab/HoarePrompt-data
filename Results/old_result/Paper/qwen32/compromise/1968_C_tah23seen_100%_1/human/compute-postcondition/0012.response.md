Output State: **The program returns a list `ans` of `n` elements where `ans[i]` is `10 - arr[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-2` and `ans[n-1]` is `10`.**

This means that the returned list `ans` will have `n` elements. The first `n-1` elements of `ans` are calculated as `10` minus the corresponding elements in the list `arr`. The last element of `ans` is always `10`.
