arr is a list of integers where each element x_i satisfies 1 \le x_i \le 500, and n is an integer such that 2 \le n \le 500 representing the length of the list arr plus one. The function is called once for each test case, and there are t test cases in total where 1 \le t \le 10^4. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
