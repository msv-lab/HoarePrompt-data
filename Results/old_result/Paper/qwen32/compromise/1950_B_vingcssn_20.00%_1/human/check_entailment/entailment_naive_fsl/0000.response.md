Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program only handles the specific cases where `n` is 1, 2, 3, or 4. It does not handle any other values of `n` within the given range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). For example, if `n` is 5, the program will print "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the correct 10x10 checkerboard pattern. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases within the specified range.
