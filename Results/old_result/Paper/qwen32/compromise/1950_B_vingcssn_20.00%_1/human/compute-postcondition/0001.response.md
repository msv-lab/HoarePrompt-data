To ensure the for loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `c` and `casos`. The loop will execute if `casos` is greater than 0 because the `range(0, casos)` will generate values from 0 up to, but not including, `casos`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `c`**: This variable is the loop variable and will be automatically initialized to 0 at the start of the loop. Therefore, we do not need to adjust its state before the loop starts.

2. **Variable `casos`**: This variable determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, `casos` must be greater than 0.

Given the constraints provided in the state before the loop starts (`1 <= t <= 20` and `1 <= n <= 20`), these constraints do not affect the execution of the loop directly. The only requirement is that `casos` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state to ensure the loop executes is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 20, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `casos` must be greater than 0**
