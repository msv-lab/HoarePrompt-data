To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided loop and its effect on the variables.

The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `min_indices`. The loop skips the iteration if `i` is equal to `max_index`, which is 0 in this case. For each valid `i`, the function `func_1` is called with arguments `min_index`, `min_index`, `min_index`, and `i`. If the result of `func_1` is `'='`, then `min_index` is updated to the value of `i`.

Let's break down the loop step-by-step:

1. Initially, `min_index` is 0.
2. The loop starts iterating over `min_indices` which is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`.
3. For `i = 0`, the `continue` statement is executed because `i` is equal to `max_index` (0).
4. For `i` from 1 to `n-1`, the function `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` is called.
5. If `func_1` returns `'='` for any `i`, `min_index` is updated to `i`.

Since the behavior of `func_1` is not specified, we can't determine the exact value of `min_index` after the loop. However, if we assume that `func_1` does not return `'='` for any `i` other than the initial `min_index` (0), then `min_index` will remain 0.

If `func_1` does return `'='` for some `i`, `min_index` will be updated to that `i`.

Since the problem specifies that `n` is not equal to 2, and without any specific behavior of `func_1`, the most conservative assumption is that `func_1` does not update `min_index`.

Therefore, the output state, assuming `func_1` does not cause any change to `min_index`, is:

Output State: **n is an input integer, n is not equal to 2, max_index is 0, min_indices is [0, 1, 2, ..., n-1], min_index is 0.**
