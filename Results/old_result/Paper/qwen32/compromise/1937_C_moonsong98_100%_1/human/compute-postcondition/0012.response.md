To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which in this case involves the variable `i` and the list `min_indices`. The loop will execute if `min_indices` contains at least one element, as `i` will iterate over each element in `min_indices`.

Given the state:
- `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 2.
- `max_index` is 0.
- `min_indices` is [0, 1, 2, ..., n-1].
- `min_index` is 0.

We need to ensure that `min_indices` has at least one element for the loop to execute. This means `n` must be at least 1 since `min_indices` is defined as a list from 0 to `n-1`.

The value of `max_index` and `min_index` do not directly impact the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted in terms of ensuring the loop runs.

Thus, the adjustment needed is to ensure `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `max_index` is 0, `min_indices` is [0, 1, 2, ..., n-1], `min_index` is 0**.
