To determine the Output State, we need to understand the impact of calling `func_2(max_index, min_index)`. However, the function `func_2` is not defined in the provided code snippet, so we cannot determine the exact changes it makes to `max_index` and `min_index` or any other variables.

Given that the function `func_2` is not provided, we can only assume that it does not modify the variables `n`, `max_index`, `min_indices`, or `min_index` unless explicitly stated otherwise. Therefore, we will assume no changes occur to these variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to 2, `max_index` is 0, `min_indices` is [0, 1, 2, ..., n-1], `min_index` is 0.**
