Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 2, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True, and `results` is ['NO']. The character at index `j` in `row1` is not '>', `j` is less than `n - 1`, and the character at index `j` in `row2` is '>'**

In this output state, the only variable that has been changed is `reachable_second_row`, which is now set to `True`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
