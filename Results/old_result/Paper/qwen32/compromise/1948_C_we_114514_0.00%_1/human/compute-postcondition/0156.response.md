Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 2, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `results` is ['NO'], `j` is 1. If `reachable_second_row` is True, and `row2[j]` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` remains True. If `reachable_second_row` is True and `row2[j]` is not '>', then `reachable_second_row` remains True. If `reachable_second_row` is False, it remains False. If `row1[j]` is not '>', `reachable_first_row` is set to False.**
