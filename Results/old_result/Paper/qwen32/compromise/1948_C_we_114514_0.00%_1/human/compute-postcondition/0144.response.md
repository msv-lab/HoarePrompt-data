Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 2, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `results` is ['NO'], `j` is 2. If `reachable_second_row` is True, the state of `reachable_first_row` is determined based on the conditions specified in the precondition: it remains True or False based on the value of `row1[j]` and potentially `row2[j]` if `row1[j]` is not '>' and `j` is less than `n - 1`. If `j` equals `n - 1`, the state of `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged. If `reachable_second_row` is False, the state of `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged regardless of the values of `row1[j]` and `row2[j]`.**
