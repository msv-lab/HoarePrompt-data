To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the given loop and the provided output states for the first three iterations.

The loop processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n`. The goal is to determine if it is possible to reach the end of the second row (`row2`) starting from the beginning of the first row (`row1`).

Hereâ€™s a summary of the provided output states:

1. **After 1 iteration**:
   - `test_cases` contains one test case: `(2, "<>", "<>")`.
   - The result depends on whether `reachable_second_row` is `True` or `False`.
   - `results` is `['YES']` if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, otherwise `['NO']`.

2. **After 2 iterations**:
   - `test_cases` contains two test cases: `(2, "<>", "<>")` and `(3, "<>", "<>")`.
   - The result for the second test case depends on whether `reachable_second_row` is `True` or `False`.
   - `results` is `['YES', 'YES']` if `reachable_second_row` is `True` for both test cases, `['YES', 'NO']` if `reachable_second_row` is `True` for the first and `False` for the second, and so on.

3. **After 3 iterations**:
   - `test_cases` contains three test cases: `(2, "<>", "<>")`, `(3, "<>", "<>")`, and another `(2, "<>", "<>")`.
   - The result for the third test case depends on whether `reachable_second_row` is `True` or `False`.
   - `results` is `['NO', 'YES', 'YES']` if `reachable_second_row` is `False` for the first and `True` for the second and third, and so on.

Given these, we can infer that the final state of `results` will be a list of `'YES'` or `'NO'` corresponding to each test case, depending on whether `reachable_second_row` is `True` or `False` for each test case.

Since the exact values of `reachable_second_row` for each test case are not provided, we can only describe the final state in terms of the length of `results` and its possible contents.

**Final Output State**:
- `results` will be a list of length `t` (the number of test cases).
- Each element in `results` will be either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, depending on whether `reachable_second_row` is `True` or `False` for the corresponding test case.

Output State: **results is a list of length `t` where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO', determined by the reachability of the end of `row2` from the start of `row1` for each test case.**
