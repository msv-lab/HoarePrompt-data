Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 3, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is True, and `reachable_second_row` is True. If `row2[j]` is equal to '>', and `j` is equal to `n - 1`, then no changes are made to the variables beyond `j` being equal to `n - 1`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
