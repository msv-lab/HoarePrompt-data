Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")], `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `j + 1`, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_second_row` remains True. If `row2[j] == '>'` and `reachable_first_row` is True and `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row1[j]` is not '>', then `reachable_first_row` is set to False. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged.**
