Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")], `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `j + 1`, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_second_row` is True. If `reachable_first_row` is True and `j` equals `n - 1`, the state of the variables remains as described. If `reachable_first_row` is True and `j` is less than `n - 1`, `reachable_first_row` is set to False if `row1[j]` is not '>' and `row2[j]` is '>'; otherwise, no changes are made to `reachable_first_row`. If `reachable_first_row` is False, no changes are made to the variables.**
