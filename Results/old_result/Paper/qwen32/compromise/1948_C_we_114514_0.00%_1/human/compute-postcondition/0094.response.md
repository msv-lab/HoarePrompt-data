Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 3, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True if `j` is 2 and `row1[j]` is '>', or if `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` is '>', or if `j` equals `n - 1`, `j` is 3**

In this output state, `reachable_first_row` has been explicitly set to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial conditions.
