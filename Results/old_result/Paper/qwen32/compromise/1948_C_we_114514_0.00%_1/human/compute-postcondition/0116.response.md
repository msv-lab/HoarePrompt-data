Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 2, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is True, and `reachable_second_row` is False, and `results` is ['NO']. The condition `reachable_first_row` is True. Additionally, `row1[j]` is `'>'`. The current value of `j` is `n - 1`, which is 1.**
