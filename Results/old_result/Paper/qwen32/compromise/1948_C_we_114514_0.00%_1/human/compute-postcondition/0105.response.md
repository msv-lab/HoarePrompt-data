The code snippet provided appends the string `'YES'` to a list named `results`. However, the initial state does not mention the existence of the `results` list. Assuming `results` is an existing list, it will now contain the string `'YES'`.

The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `row1`, `row2`, `reachable_first_row`, and `reachable_second_row`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 3, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `results` is ['YES']**.
