The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are modified, and the initial states of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, n is even) and two strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `results` is an empty list.**
