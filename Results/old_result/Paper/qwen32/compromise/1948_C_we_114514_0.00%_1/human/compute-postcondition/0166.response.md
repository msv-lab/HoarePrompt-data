Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n` consisting of '<' and/or '>'. It returns a list of length `t` where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether it is possible to reach the end of `row2` from the start of `row1` for each test case.**
