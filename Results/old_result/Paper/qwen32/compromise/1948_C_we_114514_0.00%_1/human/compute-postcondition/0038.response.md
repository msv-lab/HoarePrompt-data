The given code snippet reassigns the value `True` to the variable `reachable_second_row`. However, since `reachable_second_row` was already `True` in the initial state, this reassignment does not change its value.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State, except that we explicitly note the unchanged value of `reachable_second_row` for clarity.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")], `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `j + 1`, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_second_row` is True**
