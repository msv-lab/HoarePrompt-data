The code snippet unpacks the first element of the `test_cases` list into `n` and the second element into a tuple `(row1, row2)`. Given the initial state, `test_cases` is `[(2, "<>", "<>")]`, the unpacking will assign `n` the value `2` and `(row1, row2)` the tuple `("<>", "<>")`. Therefore, `row1` will be `"<>"` and `row2` will be `"<>"`. The variables `t` and `results` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")], `results` is an empty list, `n` is 2, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>"**
