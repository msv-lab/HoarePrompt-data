Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 2, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `results` is ['NO'], `j` is 2. If `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` is '>', then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as well.**
