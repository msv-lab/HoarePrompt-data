Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 2, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_second_row` is True, `results` is ['NO'], `j` is 2. If `row1[j]` is '>', `reachable_first_row` remains either True or False, and if `j` equals `n - 1`, the conditions remain as stated. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `row1[j]` is not '>', `reachable_first_row` is False unless `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` is '>', in which case the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
