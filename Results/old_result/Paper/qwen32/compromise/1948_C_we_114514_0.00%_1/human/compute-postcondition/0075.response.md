The code snippet provided is:

```
reachable_second_row = True
```

This code explicitly sets the value of `reachable_second_row` to `True`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 3, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is True, `row2[j]` is equal to '>', and `j` is equal to `n - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains 1, `test_cases` remains [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` remains 3, `row1` remains "<>", `row2` remains "<>", `reachable_first_row` remains True, and `reachable_second_row` is explicitly set to True. The values of `row2[j]` and `j` remain as specified, with `row2[j]` being '>' and `j` being `n - 1`.
