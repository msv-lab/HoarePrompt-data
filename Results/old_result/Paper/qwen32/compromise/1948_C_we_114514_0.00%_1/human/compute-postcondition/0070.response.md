Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 3, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is True. If `row1[j]` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` is True if `j` equals `n - 1`, otherwise `reachable_second_row` remains False. If `row1[j]` is not '>', then `reachable_first_row` is False if `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` is '>', otherwise `reachable_second_row` remains False.**
