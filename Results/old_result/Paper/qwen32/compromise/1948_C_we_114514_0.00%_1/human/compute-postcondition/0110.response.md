The code snippet `n, (row1, row2) = test_case` unpacks the first tuple from `test_cases` into `n`, `row1`, and `row2`. Given the initial state, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, and the first tuple is `(2, "<>", "<>")`. Therefore, `n` will be assigned the value `2`, and `row1` and `row2` will be assigned the value `"<>"` each.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 2, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is either True or False, and `results` is ['YES'] if `reachable_second_row` is True, otherwise `results` is ['NO']**.
