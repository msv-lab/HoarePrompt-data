Output State: **`A` is the tuple of values returned by `func_4()`, `n` is greater than 1, `m`, `k`, `D` is a sorted list of unique values from `func_4()`, `F` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `i` is 4, `diff` is `A[4] - A[3]`, `next_max_diff` is `A[4] - A[3]`.**

In this output state, the variable `next_max_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`, which is `A[4] - A[3]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
