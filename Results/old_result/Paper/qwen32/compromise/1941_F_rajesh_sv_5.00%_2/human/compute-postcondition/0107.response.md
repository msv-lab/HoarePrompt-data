Output State: **`D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left - f` is less than an element in `D`, `right - f` is greater than an element in `D` such that there is at least one element between `left - f` and `right - f` in `D`, `l < h`, `h` is `mid`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

In simple terms, the value of `h` has been updated to be equal to `mid`. All other conditions and variable values remain the same.
