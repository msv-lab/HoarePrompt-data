Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `A` is the tuple of values returned by `func_4()`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique values from `func_4()`, `F` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is `-inf`, `next_max_diff` is `-inf`, `index` is `None`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    diff = A[i] - A[i - 1]
    if diff > max_diff:
        max_diff = diff
        index = i
    elif diff > next_max_diff:
        next_max_diff = diff


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`A` is the tuple of values returned by `func_4()`, `n` is greater than 1, `m`, `k`, `D` is a sorted list of unique values from `func_4()`, `F` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `index` is `i` if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, otherwise `index` is `None`. `max_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, otherwise it remains unchanged. `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff` and `diff` is less than or equal to `max_diff`, otherwise it remains unchanged. `diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `A` is the tuple of values returned by `func_4()`, `n` is greater than 1, `m`, `k`, `D` is a sorted list of unique values from `func_4()`, `F` is the value returned by `func_4()`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, `index` is set to `i` and `max_diff` is updated to `diff`. If `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff` and less than or equal to `max_diff`, `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff`. Otherwise, `index` remains `i` if it was already set, or `None` if not, and `max_diff` and `next_max_diff` remain unchanged. `diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`, and `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `A` is the tuple of values returned by `func_4()`, `n` is greater than 1, `m`, `k`, `D` is a sorted list of unique values from `func_4()`, `F` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `i` is 4, `diff` is `A[4] - A[3]`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff` and `index` is set to 4. Otherwise, if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
