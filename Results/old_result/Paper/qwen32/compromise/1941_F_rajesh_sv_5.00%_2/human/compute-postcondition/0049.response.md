To ensure that the next iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the states of `l` and `h` such that the condition `l < h` remains true.

Given the information:
- `l` and `h` are adjusted such that `l < h`.
- `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`.
- Depending on the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, either `l` is set to `mid + 1` or `h` is set to `mid`.

To guarantee that the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that after the adjustment, `l` is still less than `h`.

Let's analyze the two possible adjustments:
1. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is set to `mid + 1`.
2. Otherwise, `h` is set to `mid`.

In both cases, we need to ensure that the new values of `l` and `h` satisfy `l < h`.

### Case 1: `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`
- `l` is updated to `mid + 1`.
- For the loop to continue, `mid + 1 < h` must be true.
- Since `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid` is always less than `h`.
- Therefore, `mid + 1 < h` will be true if `h` is at least `mid + 2`.

### Case 2: `mid_sum - left >= right - mid_next_sum`
- `h` is updated to `mid`.
- For the loop to continue, `l < mid` must be true.
- Since `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid` is always greater than or equal to `l`.
- Therefore, `l < mid` will be true if `l` is less than `mid`.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time regardless of which condition is met, we need to make sure that `h` is at least `l + 2` initially. This way, if `l` is incremented to `mid + 1`, it will still be less than `h`.

### Conclusion
To guarantee that the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `h` is at least `l + 2`.

State: **`D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left` and `right` are elements from `A`, `f` is an element from `F`, `l` and `h` are adjusted such that `h` is at least `l + 2`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is set to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is set to `mid`.**
