Postcondition: **`D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left - f` is less than an element in `D` and `right - f` is greater than an element in `D` such that there is at least one element between `left - f` and `right - f` in `D`. `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`. `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f` and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. The current value of `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`.**
