The code snippet calculates `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` by adding `f` to the elements at positions `mid` and `mid + 1` in the list `D`, respectively. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Here is the updated state:

- `mid_sum` is now `D[mid] + f`
- `mid_next_sum` is now `D[mid + 1] + f`

All other conditions and variables (`D` being a sorted list of unique values, `left - f` being less than an element in `D`, `right - f` being greater than an element in `D`, `l` being less than `h`, and `mid` being calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`) remain valid.

Output State: **`D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left - f` is less than an element in `D`, `right - f` is greater than an element in `D` such that there is at least one element between `left - f` and `right - f` in `D`, `l` is less than `h`, `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**
