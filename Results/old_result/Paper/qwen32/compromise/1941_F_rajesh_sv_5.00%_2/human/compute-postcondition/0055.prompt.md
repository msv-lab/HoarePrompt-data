Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `A` is the tuple of values returned by `func_4()`, `n` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `m` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `k` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique values from `func_4()`, `F` is the value returned by `func_4()` and must be a non-empty iterable, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index where `max_diff` was found, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is `max_diff`, `l` is the position in `D` where `left - f` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`.
Code of the loop:
while l < h:
    mid = l + (h - l) // 2
    mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
    if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        h = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left` and `right` are elements from `A`, `f` is an element from `F`, `l` and `h` are adjusted based on the comparison of `mid_sum - left` and `right - mid_next_sum`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is set to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is set to `mid`. `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, and `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are updated accordingly. The condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` determines whether `l` is incremented or `h` is decremented.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left` and `right` are elements from `A`, `f` is an element from `F`, `l` and `h` are adjusted such that `l < h`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is set to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is set to `mid`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left` and `right` are elements from `A`, `f` is an element from `F`, `l` and `h` are adjusted such that `h` is at least `l + 2`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is set to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is set to `mid`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
