The code snippet calculates the midpoint `mid` between `l` and `h`. The value of `mid` is determined by the formula `mid = l + (h - l) // 2`.

Given the initial state, the values of `D`, `left`, `right`, `f`, `l`, and `h` remain unchanged except for the introduction of the new variable `mid`. The precondition that `D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left - f` is less than an element in `D`, `right - f` is greater than an element in `D`, and there is at least one element between `left - f` and `right - f` in `D`, along with `l` being less than `h`, still holds.

Output State: **`D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left - f` is less than an element in `D`, `right - f` is greater than an element in `D` such that there is at least one element between `left - f` and `right - f` in `D`, `l` is less than `h`, `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`.**
