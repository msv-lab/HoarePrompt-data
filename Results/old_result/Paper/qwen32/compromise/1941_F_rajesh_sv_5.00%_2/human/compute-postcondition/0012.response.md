The code snippet assigns the value of `diff` to `next_max_diff`. Therefore, `next_max_diff` will now hold the same value as `diff`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`A` is the tuple of values returned by `func_4()`, `n` is greater than 1, `m`, `k`, `D` is a sorted list of unique values from `func_4()`, `F` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is `-inf`, `next_max_diff` is `diff`, `index` is `None`, and `diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`. Additionally, `diff` is less than or equal to `max_diff` and greater than `next_max_diff`.**
