Postcondition: **`D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left` and `right` are elements from `A`, `f` is an element from `F`, `l` and `h` are adjusted such that `l < h`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is set to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is set to `mid`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block is executed, considering both branches of the conditional statement.
