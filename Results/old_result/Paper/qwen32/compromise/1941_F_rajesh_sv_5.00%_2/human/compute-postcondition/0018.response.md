The code snippet provided is `index = i`. This line assigns the current value of `i` to the variable `index`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is the tuple of values returned by `func_4()`, `n` is greater than 1, `m`, `k`, `D` is a sorted list of unique values from `func_4()`, `F` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `index` is `i`, `max_diff` is `diff`, `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff` and `diff` is less than or equal to `max_diff`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
