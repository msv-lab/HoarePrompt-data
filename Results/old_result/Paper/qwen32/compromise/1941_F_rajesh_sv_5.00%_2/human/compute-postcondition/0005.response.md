The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common convention for a variable that we do not plan to use) and `testcases`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `testcases`. If `testcases` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()` minus 1, and it is guaranteed that 0 <= `testcases` <= 10^4 - 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `testcases` must be greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `_` will be a new value (which we don't care about), and `testcases` will be decremented by 1.

State: **`testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()` minus 2, and it is guaranteed that 0 <= `testcases` <= 10^4 - 2**
