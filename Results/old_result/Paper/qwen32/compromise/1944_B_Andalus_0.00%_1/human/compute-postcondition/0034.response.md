The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is in the range from 1 to `n-1`. Since `i` is currently 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it needs to be incremented by 1 to start the next iteration of the loop.

Here's the state at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end. `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element. `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element. `i` is 2. If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, `rdb` is a list containing `rgt[i]`. Otherwise, `rdb` remains an empty list.**
