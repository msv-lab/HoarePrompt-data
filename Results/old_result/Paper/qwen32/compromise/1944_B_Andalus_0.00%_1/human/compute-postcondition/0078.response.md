Output State: **`T` is an integer such that T is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least three elements, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element and must contain at least one more element, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element, `i` is `n - 1`, `sz` is 9, `elem` is the next element in `sng` after the last processed element. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined as there is no else part.**

In natural language: The value of `sz` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 8 to 9. All other variables remain unchanged.
