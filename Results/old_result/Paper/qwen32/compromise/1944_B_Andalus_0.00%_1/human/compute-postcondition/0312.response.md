The value of `sz` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`rdb`, `rgt`, `sng`, `elem`, and `k`) remain unchanged. Since the increment of `sz` does not affect the conditions related to `rdb`, `rgt`, `sng`, `elem`, or the breaking out of the loop, their states remain as described in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from the `rgt` list, `sz` is `k + 2` (or the largest even number less than `k` plus 2 if `k` is odd and all elements in `ldb` have been processed), `sng` must have at least two elements, `elem` is the next element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
