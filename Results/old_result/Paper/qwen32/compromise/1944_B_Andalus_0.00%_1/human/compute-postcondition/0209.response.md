Postcondition: **`T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one pair of adjacent duplicates, `i` is `n-1`, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have at least one duplicate next to them, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have any duplicates next to them, `rdb` contains the elements from `rgt` that have at least one duplicate next to them, and `sz` is either 0 or greater than or equal to `k`. If `k - sz` was initially greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is increased by 2 and `k - sz` remains greater than or equal to 2. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.**
