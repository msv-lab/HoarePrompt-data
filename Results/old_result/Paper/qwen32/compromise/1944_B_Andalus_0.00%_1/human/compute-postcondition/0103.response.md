To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for elem in sng:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only object in the loop head is `sng`. For the loop to execute, `sng` must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `sng` is not empty.

Let's break down the relevant parts of the state description to see how `sng` is populated:

- `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
- `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element.

To ensure `sng` is not empty, we need to ensure that there is at least one element in `lft` that is neither equal to its previous element nor its next element. This means that `lft` should have at least three elements where the middle element is not equal to its neighbors.

Given the constraints and the need for `sng` to have at least one element, let's adjust the state:

1. Ensure `n` is at least 3 to allow for a middle element in `lft`.
2. Ensure `lst` is such that `lft` after sorting has at least one element that is not equal to its neighbors.

Let's construct a state that satisfies these conditions:

- `T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000.
- `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, so let's set `n` to 3.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, such that after sorting the first `n` elements, there is at least one element that is not equal to its neighbors. For example, `lst` could be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, which would be `[1, 2, 3]`.
- `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, which would be `[4, 5]`.
- `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least three elements. Since `lft` is `[1, 2, 3]`, `ldb` would be `[]` (no duplicates).
- `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element, which would be `[2]` (since 2 is not equal to 1 or 3).
- `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element, which would be `[]` (no duplicates).
- `i` is `n - 1`, which is `2`.
- `sz` is `k`.

With these adjustments, `sng` will contain at least one element, ensuring the loop can execute.

State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is 3, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers such as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `lft` is `[1, 2, 3]`, `rgt` is `[4, 5]`, `ldb` is `[]`, `sng` is `[2]`, `rdb` is `[]`, `i` is 2, `sz` is `k`**
