Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1; `k` is an input integer; `sz` is `min(k, len(sng) + min(k, 2*m))`; `T` is at least 1; `lst` is a list of integers from the input; `lft` is a sorted list of the first `n` elements of `lst` with no consecutive duplicates; `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end; `ldb` is an empty list; `rdb` is an empty list; `sng` is a list containing the single element `lft[i]` if `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains an empty list.**
