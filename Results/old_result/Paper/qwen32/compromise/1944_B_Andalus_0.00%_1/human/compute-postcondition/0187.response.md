To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to understand the context and the variables involved. Let's break down the information provided:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `lst`: A list of integers provided by user input.
   - `lft`: The first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
   - `rgt`: The remaining elements of `lst` (from index `n` to the end) sorted in ascending order.
   - `ldb`: Contains all elements in `lft` that have at least one duplicate next to them.
   - `sng`: Contains all elements in `lft` that do not have any duplicates next to them and must have at least one element.
   - `rdb`: Contains elements from `rgt` that have at least one duplicate next to them.
   - `sz`: The largest even number less than or equal to `k` if there are enough elements in `ldb` to reach that count, or the total number of elements printed from `ldb` if `k` is not reached.
   - `i`: Initialized to `n-1` (though not directly used in the `print` statement).

2. **Loop and Conditions:**
   - The code is likely iterating over elements in `ldb` and `sng` to print elements.
   - The loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement prints an element followed by a space, without moving to a new line.

### Explanation of the Print Statement Execution:
The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement suggests that `elem` is an element from either `ldb` or `sng` (or potentially `rdb` depending on the context). However, the problem statement does not explicitly state where `elem` is coming from. Given the context, it is most likely coming from `ldb` or `sng`. 

Since `ldb` contains elements with duplicates next to them in `lft` and `sng` contains elements without duplicates next to them in `lft`, and considering the loop is likely iterating over these lists, `elem` would be an element from either of these lists.

### Determining the Output:
- `elem` is an element from `ldb` or `sng`.
- The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print this element followed by a space.

### Final Output:
Since the exact elements of `ldb` and `sng` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `elem`. However, we know the context and the format of the output.

Output: **elem (where elem is an element from either `ldb` or `sng`)**
