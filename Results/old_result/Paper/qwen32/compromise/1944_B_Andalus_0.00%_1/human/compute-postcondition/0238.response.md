The value of `sz` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`sng` and `elem`) and their preconditions remain unchanged. The condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement is now `sz >= k` after the increment.

Output State: **`sz` is `min(k, 2*m) + 3`, `sng` is an iterable with at least one more element, and `elem` is the next element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
