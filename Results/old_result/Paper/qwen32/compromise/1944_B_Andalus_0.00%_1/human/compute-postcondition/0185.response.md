Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order, `i` is `n-1`, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have at least one duplicate next to them, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have any duplicates next to them and must have at least one element, `rdb` contains the elements from `rgt` that have at least one duplicate next to them, and `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` if there are enough elements in `ldb` to reach that count, or the total number of elements printed from `ldb` if `k` is not reached. Additionally, `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, all variables retain their initial values, and the only change is that we break out of the loop or if statement.
