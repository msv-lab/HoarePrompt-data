To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and how it affects the variables. The loop iterates over elements in `rdb` and prints pairs of elements if `sz` (initially 0) is less than `k`. The loop breaks when `sz` reaches `k` or when there are no more elements in `rdb` to process.

Here's the simplified understanding of the loop:

1. **Initialization**: `sz` is 0.
2. **Condition**: The loop continues as long as `sz` is less than `k` and there are elements in `rdb`.
3. **Action**: For each element in `rdb`, if `k - sz` is at least 2, it prints the element twice and increments `sz` by 2.
4. **Termination**: The loop terminates when `sz` reaches `k` or when there are no more elements in `rdb`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that `rdb` has at least 3 elements with adjacent duplicates. After 3 iterations, `sz` would be 6 if `k` is at least 6. If `k` is less than 6, the loop would terminate before reaching 3 iterations.

### Final Output State

The final state of the loop will depend on the value of `k` and the number of elements in `rdb` that have adjacent duplicates. The loop will print pairs of elements from `rdb` until `sz` reaches `k` or there are no more elements to process. 

- If `k` is less than or equal to the number of elements in `rdb` times 2, `sz` will be equal to `k`.
- If `k` is greater than the number of elements in `rdb` times 2, `sz` will be equal to the number of elements in `rdb` times 2.

Let's assume `rdb` has `m` elements. Then the loop will print pairs of elements until `sz` reaches `min(k, 2*m)`.

### Conclusion

The final output state is:

- `T`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `i`, `ldb`, `sng`, and `rdb` remain unchanged.
- `sz` will be `min(k, 2*m)`, where `m` is the number of elements in `rdb`.

Output State: **`sz` is `min(k, 2*m)` and all other variables remain unchanged.**

In natural language: After all iterations, the variable `sz` will be the minimum of `k` and twice the number of elements in `rdb`. All other variables will remain in their initial state.
