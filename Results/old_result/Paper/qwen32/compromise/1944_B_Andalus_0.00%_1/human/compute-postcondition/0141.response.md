Postcondition: **`T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order, `i` is 3, `sz` is 3, `ldb` is `[lft[2]]` if `lft[3]` equals `lft[2]`, otherwise `ldb` is empty. If `lft[3]` is not equal to `lft[2]` and `lft[3]` is not equal to `lft[4]`, `sng` contains `lft[3]` as an additional element, otherwise `sng` is empty, and `rdb` is empty.**
