The only variable in the loop head is `elem`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `ldb`. If `ldb` has at least one element, the loop can execute. 

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `ldb` is not empty. Since `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element, we need to make sure that `lft` has at least one pair of consecutive duplicate elements.

However, the task specifies that we can only adjust the state of objects in the loop head, which in this case is `elem`. Since we cannot directly adjust `ldb` or `lft`, we must assume that `ldb` is already populated with at least one element for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state of `elem` should be set to the first element of `ldb` if `ldb` is not empty.

State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element, `i` is `n` - 1, `sz` is 0, `ldb` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the first element of `ldb`**
