The code snippet `sng.append(lft[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lft` to the list `sng`. Since `sng` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `sng` will contain the single element `lft[i]`.

Here is the updated state of the variables after the code execution:

- `n` must be greater than 1 (unchanged).
- `k` is an input integer (unchanged).
- `sz` is `min(k, len(sng) + min(k, 2*m))` (unchanged, but note that `len(sng)` will now be 1).
- `T` is at least 1 (unchanged).
- `lst` is a list of integers from the input (unchanged).
- `lft` is a sorted list of the first `n` elements of `lst` with no consecutive duplicates (unchanged).
- `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end (unchanged).
- `ldb` is an empty list (unchanged).
- `rdb` is an empty list (unchanged).
- `sng` is a list containing the single element `lft[i]` (changed from an empty list).
- `i` is an index such that `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]` (unchanged).

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `k` is an input integer; `sz` is `min(k, len(sng) + min(k, 2*m))`; `T` is at least 1; `lst` is a list of integers from the input; `lft` is a sorted list of the first `n` elements of `lst` with no consecutive duplicates; `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end; `ldb` is an empty list; `rdb` is an empty list; `sng` is a list containing the single element `lft[i]`; `i` is an index such that `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`.**
