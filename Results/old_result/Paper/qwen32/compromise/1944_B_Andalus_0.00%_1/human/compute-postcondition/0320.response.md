The provided Python code snippet contains a `print()` statement with no arguments. In Python, when `print()` is called without any arguments, it outputs a newline character.

Given the initial state, we have the following information:
- `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt`.
- `sz` is `k`.
- The first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed.

However, none of these variables or objects are used in the `print()` statement. The statement simply prints a newline character.

Therefore, the output will be an empty line.

Output: **(newline)**
