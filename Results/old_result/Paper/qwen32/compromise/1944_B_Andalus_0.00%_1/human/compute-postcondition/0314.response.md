Output State: **`rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from the `rgt` list, `sz` is `k + 2` (or the largest even number less than `k` plus 2 if `k` is odd and all elements in `ldb` have been processed), `sng` must have at least three elements, `elem` is the second element in `sng` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables `rdb`, `sz`, `sng`, and `elem` remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.
