Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order, `i` is 4, `sz` is 3, `ldb` is `[lft[2], lft[3], lft[4]]`, `sng` and `rdb` are unchanged.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ldb` has been updated to include `lft[4]`, making it `[lft[2], lft[3], lft[4]]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
