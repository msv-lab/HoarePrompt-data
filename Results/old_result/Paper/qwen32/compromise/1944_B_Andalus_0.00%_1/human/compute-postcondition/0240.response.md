The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `T`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's continuation, the only variable we need to adjust is `T`.

The loop will execute as long as `T` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `T` would have been decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `T` must be at least 1.

State: **`sz` is `min(k, len(sng) + min(k, 2*m))`, `T` is at least 1**
