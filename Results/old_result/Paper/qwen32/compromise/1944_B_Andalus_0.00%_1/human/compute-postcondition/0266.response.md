Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `sz` is `min(k, len(sng) + min(k, 2*m))`, `T` is at least 1, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list of the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `rdb` is an empty list, `i` is 2. If `i < n - 1` and `lft[i] != lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` includes the element `lft[2]` appended to it. Otherwise, `sng` remains unchanged.**
