The code snippet assigns the values of `n` and `k` by splitting the input and converting them to integers. The initial state of `T` and `t` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input.**
