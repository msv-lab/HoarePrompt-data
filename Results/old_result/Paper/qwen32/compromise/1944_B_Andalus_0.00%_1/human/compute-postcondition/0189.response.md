The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem`. According to the code, the loop will iterate over each element in the list `sng`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state of `sng` and adjust `elem` to be the next element in the list.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000.
- `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1.
- `k` is `input_k`.
- `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input.
- `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
- `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have at least one duplicate next to them.
- `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have any duplicates next to them and must have at least one element.
- `rdb` contains the elements from `rgt` that have at least one duplicate next to them.
- `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` if there are enough elements in `ldb` to reach that count, or the total number of elements printed from `ldb` if `k` is not reached, plus 1.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no specific action is taken for the else part.

At the end of the previous iteration, `elem` was the last element processed from `sng`. For the next iteration, `elem` should be the next element in `sng`. Since `sng` is a list, we can assume that `elem` was the current element being processed, so for the next iteration, `elem` should be the next element in the list `sng`.

Let's denote the current `elem` as `sng[j]`. For the next iteration, `elem` should be `sng[j+1]`.
