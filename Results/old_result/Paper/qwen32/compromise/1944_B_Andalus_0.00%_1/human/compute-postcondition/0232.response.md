Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`sz` Calculation**: `sz` is calculated as `min(k, 2*m) + 1`.
   - `k` and `m` are not explicitly defined, so we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `sz`. However, we know it is derived from `k` and `m`.
   
2. **`sng`**: `sng` is described as an iterable with at least one more element. This means that `sng` can be a list, tuple, or any other iterable type that contains at least one element.

3. **`elem`**: `elem` is defined as the next element in `sng`. This means that `elem` will be the first element of `sng` when the print statement is executed.

4. **Conditional Breakout**: The statement mentions that if `sz >= k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. However, this condition does not affect the current print statement, as it only specifies what happens if `sz >= k`, and the print statement is executed before any potential breakout.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```
- This statement prints the value of `elem` followed by a space, rather than a newline (which is the default behavior of `print`).

### Determining the Output:
- `elem` is the next element in `sng`, which means it is the first element of `sng`.
- Since `sng` is an iterable with at least one more element, `elem` will be the first element of that iterable.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the first element of the iterable `sng`, followed by a space. Since the exact value of `sng` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `elem`.

Output: **elem (where elem is the first element of the iterable sng)**
