The code snippet `sng.append(lft[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lft` to the list `sng`. Given that `i` is 4, the element `lft[4]` is appended to `sng`. Since `lft` is sorted in ascending order and `i` is 4, `lft[4]` is the fifth smallest element in the list `lft`.

The initial state specifies that if `lft[3]` is not equal to `lft[2]` and `lft[3]` is not equal to `lft[4]`, `sng` contains `lft[3]` as an additional element. However, the code snippet modifies `sng` by appending `lft[4]` regardless of the initial condition of `sng`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order, `i` is 4, and `sz` is 3. If `lft[3]` is equal to `lft[2]`, `ldb` is `[lft[2], lft[3]]` and `sng` and `rdb` are unchanged. If `lft[3]` is not equal to `lft[2]`, `ldb` is `[lft[2]]` if `lft[3]` equals `lft[2]` (which is not the case here), otherwise `ldb` is empty. If `lft[3]` is not equal to `lft[2]` and `lft[3]` is not equal to `lft[4]`, `sng` contains `lft[3]` as an additional element, otherwise `sng` is empty, and `rdb` is empty. Now, `sng` contains `lft[3]` and `lft[4]`.**
