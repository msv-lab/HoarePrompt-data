The code snippet appends the element at index `i` (which is 3) of the list `lft` to the list `ldb`. Given the initial state, `ldb` could either contain `lft[2]` or be an empty list, depending on the conditions specified. After appending `lft[3]` to `ldb`, `ldb` will definitely contain at least one element, which is `lft[3]`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end. If `lft[2]` is equal to `lft[1]`, then `ldb` contains `lft[2]` and `lft[3]`. If `lft[2]` is not equal to `lft[1]` and `lft[2]` is not equal to `lft[3]`, then `sng` contains `lft[2]` and `ldb` contains `lft[3]`. Otherwise, `ldb` contains `lft[3]` and `sng` remains empty. `rdb` remains an empty list. `i` is 3.**
