To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the values of the variables involved.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **List `lst` and its partitions (`lft` and `rgt`)**:
   - `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input.
   - `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
   - `rgt` is the remaining elements of `lst` (from index `n` to the end) sorted in ascending order.

2. **Identifying duplicates and unique elements in `lft`**:
   - `ldb` contains elements in `lft` that have at least one duplicate next to them.
   - `sng` contains elements in `lft` that do not have any duplicates next to them and must have at least one element.

3. **Identifying duplicates in `rgt`**:
   - `rdb` contains elements from `rgt` that have at least one duplicate next to them.

4. **Determine `sz`**:
   - `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` if there are enough elements in `ldb` to reach that count.
   - If `k` is not reached, `sz` is the total number of elements printed from `ldb` plus 2.

5. **Determine `elem`**:
   - `elem` is the next element in `sng`.

6. **Condition to break the loop**:
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop or if statement is broken out of.
   - Otherwise, the program continues to execute the code following the if-else block.

### Focus on `elem`:

- `elem` is explicitly defined as the next element in the list `sng`.
- `sng` contains elements in `lft` that have no duplicates next to them and must have at least one element.

### Output:

Since `elem` is the next element in `sng`, the output will be the next unique element from the sorted list `lft` that does not have a duplicate next to it.

Given the information, the most precise description of what will be printed is:

Output: **elem (where elem is the next element in the list sng, which contains unique elements from lft with no duplicates next to them)**

However, since we need to provide a specific value, and we don't have the exact values of `lst`, `n`, or `k`, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `elem`. Therefore, the most precise description we can provide based on the given precondition is:

Output: **the next unique element in the sorted list `lft` that does not have a duplicate next to it**.
