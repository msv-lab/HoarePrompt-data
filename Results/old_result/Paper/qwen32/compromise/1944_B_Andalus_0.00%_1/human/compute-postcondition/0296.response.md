Output State: **`rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from the `rgt` list, `ldb` contains at least one more element after `elem`, `sz` is increased by 2 if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `sz` remains unchanged, `elem` is the next element in `ldb` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not affect the values of `rdb`, `ldb`, `sz`, or `elem`. The conditions and values of these variables remain as specified in the initial state.
