To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and deduce the value of `elem`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **List Splitting and Sorting**:
   - `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input.
   - `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
   - `rgt` is the remaining elements of `lst` (i.e., `lst[n:]`) sorted in ascending order.

2. **Identifying `ldb` and `elem`**:
   - `ldb` contains at least one element from `lft` that has at least one duplicate next to it.
   - `elem` is the next element in `ldb` after the current `elem`.

3. **Context of the Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is executed in a context where `elem` has already been identified as an element in `ldb` with at least one duplicate next to it.
   - The statement `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` will print `elem` twice, separated by a space, and will not add a newline after the print statement.

### Determining the Value of `elem`:
- Since `elem` is an element in `ldb` and `ldb` contains elements from `lft` that have at least one duplicate next to them, `elem` is the specific value that meets this condition.
- The exact value of `elem` cannot be determined without the specific input values of `lst`, `n`, and `k`. However, based on the precondition, `elem` is guaranteed to be a value that appears at least twice consecutively in the sorted list `lft`.

### Output:
Given the above analysis, the `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, without adding a newline.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is an element in `ldb` that has at least one duplicate next to it in the sorted list `lft`)**
