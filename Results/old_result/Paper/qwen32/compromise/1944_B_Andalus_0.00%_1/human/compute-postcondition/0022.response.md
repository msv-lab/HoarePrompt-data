Postcondition: **`T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` contains `lft[i]` as its last element. Otherwise, if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` contains the element `lft[i]`. In all other cases, `ldb` and `sng` remain empty lists. `rdb` remains an empty list. `i` is 2. If `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` contains `lft[2]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains empty.**
