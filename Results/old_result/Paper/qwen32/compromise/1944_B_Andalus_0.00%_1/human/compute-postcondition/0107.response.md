To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and see if there is any information about the variable `elem`.

The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000.
- `n` is 3.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `lst` is a list of integers such as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- `lft` is `[1, 2, 3]`.
- `rgt` is `[4, 5]`.
- `ldb` is `[]`.
- `sng` is `[2]`.
- `rdb` is `[]`.
- `i` is 2.
- `sz` is `k`.
- The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`.

However, the initial state does not provide any information about the variable `elem`. Since `elem` is not defined or given any value in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `elem` from the information provided.

Given the lack of information about `elem`, we can only describe the print statement in terms of `elem` itself:

Output: **elem (where elem is an undefined variable in the given initial state)**

Since `elem` is not defined, the actual output cannot be determined precisely. However, if `elem` were to be defined elsewhere in the code (not provided in the initial state), the print statement would output the value of `elem` followed by a space.
