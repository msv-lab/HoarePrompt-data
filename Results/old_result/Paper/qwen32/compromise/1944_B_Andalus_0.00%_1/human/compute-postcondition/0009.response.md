The code snippet sorts the list `lft`. The lists `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` remain unchanged. The integer variables `T`, `t`, `n`, and `k` also remain unchanged. The only change is that the list `lft` is now sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list.**
