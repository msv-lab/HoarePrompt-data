To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how it modifies the variables involved.

The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive) and checks if the current element in `rgt` is equal to the previous element. If they are equal, the current element is added to the `rdb` list.

The loop starts with `i` initialized to `n` and iterates from 1 to `n-1`. Therefore, the loop will execute `n-1` times.

After all iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1` (the last value it took in the loop). The `rdb` list will contain all elements from `rgt` that have at least one duplicate next to them.

The output state after all the executions of the loop will be:

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order, `i` is `n-1`, `sz` is 3, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have at least one duplicate next to them, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have any duplicates next to them, and `rdb` contains the elements from `rgt` that have at least one duplicate next to them.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `i` will be `n-1`, and `rdb` will include all elements from `rgt` that have duplicates next to them. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
