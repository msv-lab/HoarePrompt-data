To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the print statement itself.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **rdb**: Contains all consecutive duplicate elements from the `rgt` list.
2. **ldb**: Contains at least one element.
3. **sz**: This variable is modified based on the condition `if k - sz >= 2`. If true, `sz` is increased by 2. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.
4. **elem**: This is the next element in `ldb`.
5. There is a loop or conditional structure that breaks if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```
This means that the value of `elem` will be printed twice, separated by a space, and no newline character will be added at the end (due to `end=' '`).

### Determining the Output:
- **elem**: The variable `elem` is described as "the next element in `ldb`". Since `ldb` contains at least one element, `elem` will be that element or the next one in the sequence if `elem` has already been assigned a value from a previous iteration.
- The print statement will output `elem` twice, separated by a space.

### Final Output:
Given the information provided, the output will be the value of `elem` printed twice, separated by a space, and no newline character at the end.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the next element in the `ldb` list)**
