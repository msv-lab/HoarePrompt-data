Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. It then prints `k` elements from the list such that each printed element appears exactly twice, if possible, and the remaining elements appear once, ensuring that the total number of printed elements is `k`. This process is repeated for each test case.**
