The code snippet provided appends the element `rgt[i]` to the list `rdb`. Given the initial state, the value of `i` is 2, so the element `rgt[2]` is appended to `rdb`. 

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order, `i` is 2, `sz` is 3, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have at least one duplicate next to them, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have any duplicates next to them, and `rdb` contains the element `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]` and now includes `rgt[2]`**.

In simpler terms: The element at index 2 in the `rgt` list is appended to the `rdb` list, regardless of whether it equals the element at index 1 in `rgt`. All other variables remain unchanged.
