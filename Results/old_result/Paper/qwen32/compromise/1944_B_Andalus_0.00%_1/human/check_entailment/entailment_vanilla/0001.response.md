### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided code and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:** 
   - Multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, we get two integers `n` and `k`, and an array `a` of length `2n`.
   - Array `a` consists of each integer from `1` to `n` exactly twice.
   - We need to find two arrays `l` and `r` of length `2k` such that:
     - `l` is a subset of the first `n` elements of `a`.
     - `r` is a subset of the last `n` elements of `a`.
     - The XOR of elements in `l` equals the XOR of elements in `r`.
   
2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output two lines:
     - The first line contains the elements of `l`.
     - The second line contains the elements of `r`.

#### Approach Analysis:
- The code first reads the number of test cases `T`.
- For each test case:
  - It reads `n` and `k`.
  - It reads the array `a` and splits it into two halves: `lft` (first `n` elements) and `rgt` (last `n` elements).
  - It initializes three lists: `ldb` (to store elements that appear twice in `lft`), `rdb` (to store elements that appear twice in `rgt`), and `sng` (to store elements that appear only once in `lft`).
  - It sorts `lft` and `rgt`.
  - It populates `ldb` with elements that appear twice in `lft` and `rdb` with elements that appear twice in `rgt`.
  - It also populates `sng` with elements that appear only once in `lft`.
  - It then tries to construct `l` and `r` by:
    - Adding pairs of elements from `ldb` to `l` and `r` until it reaches `k` elements or exhausts `ldb`.
    - Adding elements from `sng` to `l` and `r` until it reaches `k` elements or exhausts `sng`.

#### Issues in the Code:
- The code does not ensure that `r` is a subset of the second `n` elements of `a`.
  - It uses the same `sng` list for both `l` and `r`, which might lead to elements being included in both `l` and `r` that are not in the correct halves of `a`.
- The code does not guarantee that the XOR of `l` and `r` will be equal.
  - Adding elements from `sng` to both `l` and `r` without considering the XOR effect might not yield the required condition.
- The code does not handle all cases correctly, especially when `k > 1` and the XOR condition is complex.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure that `l` and `r` are subsets of the correct halves of `a` and does not guarantee that their XOR values will be equal.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
