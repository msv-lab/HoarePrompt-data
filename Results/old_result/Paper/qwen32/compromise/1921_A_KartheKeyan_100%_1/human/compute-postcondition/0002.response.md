In the provided task, the `while` loop condition is `while n:`. This loop will execute as long as `n` is a non-zero value. Therefore, to ensure that the first iteration of the loop can proceed, `n` must be any non-zero integer.

The coordinates of the corners of the square (x_i, y_i) are not involved in the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this, the state right before the loop should ensure that `n` is non-zero. 

### Task Answer:
State: **Each test case consists of four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) where -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area; `n` must be a non-zero integer.**

This ensures that the `while` loop can execute its first iteration.
