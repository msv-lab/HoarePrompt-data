The code appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. This means that `coord` will now contain two tuples, the original `(x, y)` and the newly appended `(x, y)`. The values of `x`, `y`, `n`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, `n` must be a non-zero integer, `coord` is a list containing two tuples `[(x, y), (x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 1**.
