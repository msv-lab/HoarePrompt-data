The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to `x` and `y` respectively. This means the values of `x` and `y` will be updated based on the new input.

Output State: **`x` is the first integer from the new input, `y` is the second integer from the new input, `n` must be a non-zero integer, `coord` is a list containing two tuples `[(x, y), (x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 2.**

In natural language: The values of `x` and `y` are updated to the integers provided in the new input. All other variables (`n`, `coord`, `res`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
