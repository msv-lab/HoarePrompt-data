The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range limit, which is the constant `4` in this case. Therefore, we only need to adjust the variable `i` for the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `0`. Since the loop iterates from `0` to `3` (inclusive), at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by `1`.

So, `i` should be `1` for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, each test case consists of four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) where -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, `n` must be a non-zero integer, `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 1**
