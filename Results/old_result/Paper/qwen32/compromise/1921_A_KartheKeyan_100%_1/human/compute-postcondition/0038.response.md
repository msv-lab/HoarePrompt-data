To determine the output of the `print(round(res))` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

1. **Variables and their Definitions:**
   - `x` and `y` are the first and second integers from the last input, respectively.
   - `n` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `coord` is a sorted list of the coordinates `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]`.
   - `i` is set to 3.
   - `p1` is calculated as `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, which is the difference between the x-coordinates of the second and first points in the sorted list `coord`.
   - `p2` is calculated as `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, which is the difference between the x-coordinates of the fourth and third points in the sorted list `coord`.
   - `res` is calculated as `math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)`.

2. **Calculation of `res`:**
   - `p1` is the difference between the x-coordinates of the second and first points in the sorted list `coord`.
   - `p2` is the difference between the x-coordinates of the fourth and third points in the sorted list `coord`.
   - `res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.

3. **Output of `print(round(res))`:**
   - The value of `res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.
   - The `round()` function rounds `res` to the nearest integer.
   - The final output will be the rounded value of `res`.

Since the exact values of `x`, `y`, and the coordinates in `coord` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output as the rounded value of `res`.

Output: **round(res) (where res is the product of the square roots of p1 and p2, and p1 and p2 are the differences between the x-coordinates of specific points in the sorted list `coord`)**
