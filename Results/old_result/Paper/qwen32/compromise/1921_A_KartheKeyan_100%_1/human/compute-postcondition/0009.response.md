The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to `x` and `y` respectively. The initial state of `x` and `y` as input integers is overwritten by the new input values. The other variables (`n`, `coord`, `res`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, `n` must be a non-zero integer, `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 1**.
