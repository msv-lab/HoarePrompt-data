The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `res`. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is the first integer from the last input, `y` is the second integer from the last input, `n` must be at least 2, `coord` is `[]`, `res` is `0`, `i` is 3, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**.
