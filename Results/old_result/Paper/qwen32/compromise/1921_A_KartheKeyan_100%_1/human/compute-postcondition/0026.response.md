Output State: **`x` is the first integer from the new input, `y` is the second integer from the new input, `n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is `[(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 0, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `x` and `y` remain the first and second integers from the new input, respectively. `n` still must be greater than 0. The `coord` list now includes the new tuple `(x, y)` at the end, making it `[(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (x, y)]`. The values of `res` and `i` are unchanged, still 0. The values of `p1` and `p2` remain as `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])` and `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, respectively.
