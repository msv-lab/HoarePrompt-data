### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided program and verify if it correctly calculates the area of the square based on the given coordinates of its corners.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads four lines of input, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of a corner of the square.

2. **Sorting and Distance Calculation:**
   - The coordinates are stored in a list and sorted.
   - The program calculates the squared distance between the first two sorted points (`p1`) and between the last two sorted points (`p2`).
   - Since the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the distances between adjacent points along the same axis (either x or y) should be equal. The program calculates the Euclidean distance between these points and multiplies them, assuming they represent the side lengths of the square.

3. **Area Calculation:**
   - The area of the square is calculated by multiplying the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, which are the squared distances between the points.
   - The result is rounded to the nearest integer and printed.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Distance Calculation for Square Sides:**
  - The program assumes that the distances between the first two and the last two points in the sorted list represent the sides of the square. However, this is not guaranteed. The sides of the square could be represented by the distances between other pairs of points.
  - The correct approach is to find the unique x and y coordinates among the four points. The side length of the square can be determined by the difference between the maximum and minimum x (or y) coordinates.

### Correct Approach:
1. Extract the x and y coordinates from the input.
2. Determine the side length of the square as the difference between the maximum and minimum x (or y) coordinates.
3. Calculate the area as the square of the side length.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the current implementation, the program is not correct for all possible inputs.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
