You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. It calculates and prints the area of each square.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
- We are given the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.
- We need to calculate the area of the square.
- The area of a square is calculated as the side length squared.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square.

2. **Sorting the Coordinates**:
   - The coordinates are sorted. However, sorting the coordinates in this manner does not directly help in determining the side length of the square. Sorting based on the x or y values alone does not necessarily place the coordinates in a way that allows easy calculation of the side length.

3. **Calculating Side Length**:
   - The program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of coordinates (`p1` and `p2`), which are assumed to be adjacent sides of the square.
   - It then calculates the side length by taking the square root of the product of these distances (`res = math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)`).
   - The result is rounded and printed.

### Issues in the Program:
- The method of selecting the pairs of coordinates to calculate the side lengths is incorrect. Simply taking the first two and the last two sorted coordinates does not guarantee that they are adjacent sides of the square.
- The calculation of the side length is flawed. The area of the square should be calculated as the square of the length of one side, not the product of the lengths of two sides.
- The rounding of the result before printing may not be necessary and could lead to incorrect results due to floating-point precision issues.

### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach would be to find the unique x and y coordinates, which will give us the side length of the square.
- The side length can be calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum x (or y) coordinates.
- The area is then the square of this side length.

### Example Fix:
Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        x_coords = [point[0] for point in coord]
        y_coords = [point[1] for point in coord]
        side_length = max(x_coords) - min(x_coords)
        area = side_length ** 2
        print(area)
        n -= 1

func()
```
