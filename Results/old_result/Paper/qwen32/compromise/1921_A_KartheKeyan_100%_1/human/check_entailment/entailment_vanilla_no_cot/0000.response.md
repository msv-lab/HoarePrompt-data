Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a logical error in how it calculates the area of the square. It calculates the distance between two adjacent points and then multiplies these distances, which is incorrect. The correct approach is to find the distance between two adjacent points and then square this distance to get the area of the square.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        # Sort the coordinates to make it easier to identify adjacent points
        coord = sorted(coord)
        # Calculate the distance between two adjacent points
        side_length = math.sqrt((coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2)
        # The area of the square is the side length squared
        area = side_length ** 2
        print(int(area))
        n -= 1

func()
```

This corrected program calculates the distance between two adjacent points, squares this distance to get the area, and prints the result.
