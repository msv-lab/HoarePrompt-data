Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all the buns. The issue lies in the `func_1` function and the logic used in the binary search to find the optimal `k`.

The `func_1` function calculates the total revenue for a given `k` but it does not correctly represent the profit for selling the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price. Specifically, it adds `k * b` to the total revenue, which is incorrect because the price of the i-th bun should be `(b - i + 1)` for `i` from `1` to `k`.

Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function and the main logic to find the maximum profit:

```python
def func_1(k, a, b, n):
    # Calculate the revenue from selling the first k buns at the modified price
    modified_price_revenue = sum(b - i + 1 for i in range(k))
    # Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining (n - k) buns at the usual price
    usual_price_revenue = (n - k) * a
    # Total revenue
    total_revenue = modified_price_revenue + usual_price_revenue
    return total_revenue

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        # Iterate over all possible values of k from 0 to n
        for k in range(n + 1):
            current_profit = func_1(k, a, b, n)
            if current_profit > max_profit:
                max_profit = current_profit
        print(max_profit)
```

In this corrected version, we iterate over all possible values of `k` from `0` to `n` and calculate the total revenue for each `k`. We then keep track of the maximum revenue, which represents the maximum profit Bob can obtain.

The original program's binary search approach is incorrect because it does not properly evaluate the revenue for each `k` and instead uses an incorrect condition to determine the maximum profit.
