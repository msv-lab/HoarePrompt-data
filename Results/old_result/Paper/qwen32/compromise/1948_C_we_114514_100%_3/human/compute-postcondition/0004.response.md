To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand what happens within each iteration of the loop. Here's a breakdown:

- The loop runs `t` times.
- In each iteration, the following actions occur:
  - `n` is reassigned to a new integer value read from the input.
  - `row1` is reassigned to a new string of length `n` consisting of '<' and/or '>'.
  - `row2` is reassigned to a new string of length `n` consisting of '<' and/or '>'.
  - The function `func_1(n, row1, row2)` is called with the new `n`, `row1`, and `row2`, and its result is appended to the `results` list.

After all iterations, the state of `n`, `row1`, and `row2` will reflect the values from the last iteration, as they are reassigned in each iteration. The `results` list will contain `t` elements, each being the result of calling `func_1` with the corresponding `n`, `row1`, and `row2` from each iteration.

Given that the initial values of `n`, `row1`, and `row2` are not used within the loop after the first iteration, the final values of these variables will be those from the last iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value from the last iteration, `row1` is the string from the last iteration, `row2` is the string from the last iteration, `t` remains unchanged, `results` is a list of `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` from each iteration.**
