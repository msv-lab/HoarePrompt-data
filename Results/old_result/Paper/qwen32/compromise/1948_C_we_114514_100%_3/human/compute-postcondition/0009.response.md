Functionality: **The function `func_1` determines if a robot can move from position (1,1) to (2,n) on a grid based on the given rules defined by the strings `row1` and `row2`. It returns 'No' if the robot cannot make the move due to specific configurations of '<' and '>' in `row1` and `row2`, otherwise it returns 'Yes'.**
