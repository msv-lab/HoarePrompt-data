In the given initial state, we have several variables defined, but the `print` statement only refers to the variable `s`. The variable `s` is explicitly defined as the binary string `'1011'`.

The `print` statement includes a `sep=''` argument, but since only one item (`s`) is being printed, the `sep` argument does not affect the output. 

Thus, the `print` statement will output the value of `s` directly.

Output: **1011**
