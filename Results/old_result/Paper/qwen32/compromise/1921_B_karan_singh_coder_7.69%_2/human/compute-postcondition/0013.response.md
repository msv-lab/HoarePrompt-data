Output State: **`t` is a string input by the user; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a string input by the user; `s1` is the count of '1's in `s`; `t1` is the count of '1's in `t`; `cnt` is the number of positions where the characters in `s` and `t` differ; `i` is `n-1`.**

In simple terms, after all iterations of the loop, `cnt` will hold the total number of positions where the characters in the strings `s` and `t` are different. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, reflecting the last index that was checked in the loop. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `s1`, and `t1`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
