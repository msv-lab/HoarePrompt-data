The code snippet `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` compares the characters at index `i` in the strings `s` and `t`. If the characters are not equal, `cnt` is incremented by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so the comparison is between the first characters of `s` and `t`.

If `s[0]` is not equal to `t[0]`, `cnt` will be 1. If they are equal, `cnt` will remain 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `s1`, `t1`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the new string input by the user, `n` is the new input integer (must be greater than 0), `s` is the new string input by the user, `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in the new `t`, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 0**
