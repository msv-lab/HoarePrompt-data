The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. The value of `n` remains the same as it is the loop's upper bound and does not change during iterations.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`t` is the new string input by the user, `n` is the new input integer (must be greater than 0), `s` is the new string input by the user, `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in the new `t`, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 1**
