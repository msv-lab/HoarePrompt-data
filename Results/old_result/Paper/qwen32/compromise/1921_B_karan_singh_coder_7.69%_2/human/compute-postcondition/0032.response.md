Output State: **`t` is a new string input by the user; `n` is a new input integer that must be greater than 1; `s` is the new string input by the user; `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`; `t1` is the count of '1's in the new `t`; `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `t[0]` and by 1 if `s[1]` is not equal to `t[1]`; `i` is 1; if the count of '1's in the new `s` is equal to the count of '1's in the new `t`, no additional variable `d` is defined. Otherwise, `d` is defined as the absolute difference between the new `s1` and `t1`.**
