Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `i` is 2, `j` is 1. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, then `s` is 'b', `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros except `char_count[0]` which is `a[2] + 1` and `char_count[1]` which is 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `s` remains an empty string and `char_count` remains a list of 26 zeros.**
