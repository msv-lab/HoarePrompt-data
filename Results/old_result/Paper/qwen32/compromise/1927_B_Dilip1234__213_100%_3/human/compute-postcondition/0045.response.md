The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` should be incremented by 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `i` is 2, `j` is 1. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, then `s` is 'a', `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros except `char_count[0]` which is `a[2] + 1`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `s` remains an empty string and `char_count` remains a list of 26 zeros.**
