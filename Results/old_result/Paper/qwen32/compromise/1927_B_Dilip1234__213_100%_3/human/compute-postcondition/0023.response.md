Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `s` is a string containing a single character `chr(j + ord('a'))`, `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros, `i` is 1, and `char_count[j]` is equal to `a[i]`.**

In natural language: The string `s` now contains a single character determined by the value of `j`. All other variables remain unchanged.
