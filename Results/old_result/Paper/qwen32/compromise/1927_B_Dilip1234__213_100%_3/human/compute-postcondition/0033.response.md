The code snippet `s += chr(j + ord('a'))` appends a character to the string `s` based on the value of `j`. Given that `j` is 3, the character appended will be `chr(3 + ord('a'))`, which is `chr(3 + 97)`, resulting in `chr(100)`, which is the character `'d'`.

Therefore, if `s` was previously an empty string, it will now be `'d'`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `char_count`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `s` is `'d'`, `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros.**
