Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `s` is a string containing a single character `chr(j + ord('a'))`, `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros except `char_count[j]` which is `a[i] + 1`, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
