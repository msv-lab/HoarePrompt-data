To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the condition `power < log2(n)`. The variables involved in this condition are `power` and `n`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
   - `n` is an integer value of the input, and `n` is not equal to 1.
   - `power` is 1.

2. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The loop condition is `power < log2(n)`.
   - For the loop to execute, `power` must be less than `log2(n)`.

3. **Current Values**:
   - `power` is 1.
   - `n` is an integer, and it is not equal to 1, so `log2(n)` is defined and greater than 0.

4. **Adjustment**:
   - Since `power` is 1, `log2(n)` must be greater than 1 for the condition to be true.
   - This means `n` must be greater than 2 because `log2(2) = 1` and we need `log2(n) > 1`.

Thus, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is greater than 2.

**Final State**:
State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is 1**
