Based on the initial state provided, we can analyze the variables and the print statement:

1. `n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
2. `n` is an input integer.
3. If `n` is equal to 1, no additional changes are made to `n` or `n_cases`.
4. If `n` is not equal to 1, `power` is set to `floor(log2(n)) + 1`.
5. If `power` is equal to `n`, then `power` remains equal to `n`; otherwise, `power` remains `floor(log2(n))`.
6. `i` is 1 more than its previous value.

However, the print statement in the given code snippet is:
```python
print(1)
```

This statement will print the integer `1` regardless of the values of `n_cases`, `n`, `power`, or `i`.

Therefore, the output is simply the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
