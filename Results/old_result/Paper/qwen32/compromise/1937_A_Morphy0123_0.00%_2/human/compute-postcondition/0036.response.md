Let's break down the problem step by step using the given initial state:

1. **Variables and their meanings:**
   - `n_cases`: An integer representing the number of test cases.
   - `n`: An input integer.
   - `power`: Calculated using `floor(log2(n))`, which means it is the greatest integer less than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of `n`.

2. **Expression to be printed:**
   - The code snippet is `print(2 ** power)`, which means we need to print 2 raised to the power of `power`.

3. **Understanding `power`:**
   - `power` is the highest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \leq n\).
   - For example, if \(n = 10\), \( \log_2(10) \approx 3.32\), and `floor(log2(10))` would be 3, so `power` would be 3.
   - Therefore, `2 ** power` would be \(2^3 = 8\).

4. **Generalizing the output:**
   - The value of `2 ** power` is the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`.
   - Since we don't have the specific value of `n`, we can only describe the output in terms of `n`.

Based on the above reasoning, the output of the `print` statement is the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`.

Output: **2 ** power (where power is the greatest integer such that 2 ** power <= n)**
