The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print(1)
```

The initial state provides information about variables `n_cases`, `n`, and `i`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement directly prints the integer `1`.

Since the `print` statement is independent of the variables mentioned in the initial state, the output will simply be the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
