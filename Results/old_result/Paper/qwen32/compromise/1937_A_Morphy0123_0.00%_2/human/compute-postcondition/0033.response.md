Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
2. `n` is the input integer.
3. `power` is calculated as `floor(log2(n)) + 1`.
4. The current value of `power` is equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

### Analysis:
From the initial state, we know that `power` is initially defined as `floor(log2(n)) + 1`. However, it is then stated that the current value of `power` is equal to `n`. This means that we should use `n` as the value for `power` in the `print` statement.

### Calculation:
The `print` statement will compute `2 ** power`, where `power` is `n`. Therefore, the output will be `2` raised to the power of `n`.

### Output:
Output: **2 ** n (where n is the input integer)**

This means that the code will print `2` raised to the power of the input integer `n`.
