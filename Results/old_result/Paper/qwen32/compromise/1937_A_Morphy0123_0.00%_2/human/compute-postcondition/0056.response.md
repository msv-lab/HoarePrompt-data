Postcondition: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an input integer, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `n` equals 1, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `power` is set to `ceil(log2(n))`. If `power` equals `n`, `power` remains `n`. Otherwise, `power` is `ceil(log2(n)) - 1` and `power` is not equal to `n`.**
