The code appends a new element to the list `li`. The new element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`. This means the list `li` now contains one additional element compared to its initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 500\), `c` and `d` are integers such that \(1 \leq c, d \leq 10^6\), `l` is a list of \(n^2\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\), `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing `n` elements plus one additional element `[a + k * c, a + k * c + d, a + k * c + 2 * d, \ldots, a + k * c + (n-1) * d, a + k * c + d * h]`, `k` is an integer**.
