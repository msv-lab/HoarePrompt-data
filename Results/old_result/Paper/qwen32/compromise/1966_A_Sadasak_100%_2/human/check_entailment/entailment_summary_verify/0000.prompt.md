You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/ac8986e55ddc41e4d0ee63ac67222f97e7fcc1bf.png)

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        if k in freq.values():
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
    return frequency_table



- Function Summary: 
The function takes a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`, and returns a dictionary where each key is a unique number from `arr` and each value is the minimum of the count of that number in `arr` and `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the allowed operations. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Frequency Table Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the frequency of each card number but it incorrectly caps the frequency at `k`. This means that if there are more than `k` cards of the same number, it will only consider `k` of them, which is not the correct approach. The correct approach should be to count the actual frequency of each card number.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cards:**
   - The program checks if `k` is in the frequency table values and prints `k - 1` if true. This is not the correct way to determine the minimum number of cards. Instead, the program should calculate the minimum number of cards that can be left after performing the allowed operations.

3. **General Approach:**
   - The correct approach is to use the frequency of each card number and apply the operation of exchanging `k` cards for `k-1` cards as many times as possible. This can be done by iterating over the frequency of each card number and reducing the count by `k-1` until the count is less than `k`.

Let's consider a simple test case to illustrate the issue:
```
Input:
1
6 3
1 1 1 1 1 1

Expected Output:
2

Explanation:
We can exchange 3 cards of number 1 for 2 cards, resulting in 5 cards of number 1.
We can then exchange another 3 cards of number 1 for 2 cards, resulting in 4 cards of number 1.
We can then exchange another 3 cards of number 1 for 2 cards, resulting in 3 cards of number 1.
Finally, we can exchange 3 cards of number 1 for 2 cards, resulting in 2 cards of number 1.
```

The provided program will not produce the correct result for this test case or for many other test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
