Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the specified operations. The operations allow us to exchange any `k` cards of the same number for `k-1` cards of any number. 

### Key Points:
1. **Input**: 
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of cards.
     - `k`: Number of cards to exchange.
     - `nums`: List of numbers on the cards.

2. **Output**:
   - Minimum number of cards left after any number of operations.

3. **Logic**:
   - If `k > n`, no operations can be performed, so the answer is `n`.
   - Otherwise, we need to count the frequency of each card number and determine the optimal way to reduce the number of cards.

### Program Analysis:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards left. Here's why:

1. **Handling `k > n`**:
   - The program correctly prints `n` if `k > n` since no operations can be performed.

2. **Counting Frequencies**:
   - The program uses a function `func_1` to create a frequency table of the card numbers. However, the function truncates frequencies to `k`, which is incorrect. We should count the actual frequencies.

3. **Determining Minimum Cards**:
   - The program incorrectly checks if `k` is in the frequency values and prints `k-1` if true. This logic is flawed. We need to use the frequencies to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations.

### Correct Approach:
- Count the frequency of each card number.
- For each unique card number with frequency `f`, we can perform `(f // k)` operations, reducing the count of that card by `(f % k)`.
- The sum of these reduced counts will give the minimum number of cards left.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it truncates frequencies and uses an incorrect logic to determine the minimum number of cards left.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
