The code snippet initializes an empty dictionary named `frequency_table`. This dictionary does not affect the values of `arr` or `k`, which remain as they were in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the `frequency_table` variable.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards, and `k` is an integer representing the number of cards to exchange during each operation, such that 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 2 <= k <= 100. Additionally, each element c_i in arr satisfies 1 <= c_i <= 100. `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary.**
