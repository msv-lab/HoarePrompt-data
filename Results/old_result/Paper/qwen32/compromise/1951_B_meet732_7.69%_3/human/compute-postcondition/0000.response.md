The code snippet `x = a[k]` assigns the value of the element at index `k` in the list `a` to the variable `x`. Given that `a` is a list where the first element `t` represents the number of test cases, and the subsequent elements are structured as pairs of `n` (number of cows), `k` (your cow's index), and a list of `n` integers (Cowdeforces ratings), the value of `x` will be the Cowdeforces rating of the cow at the index `k` in each test case's list of ratings.

Since `k` is 1-based in the problem description (as it represents your cow's index in 1-based indexing), we need to adjust for 0-based indexing in Python by using `a[k-1]` to get the correct value. However, the provided code snippet uses `a[k]`, so we will follow that directly.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by t pairs of inputs. Each pair consists of two integers `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ n) representing the number of cows and your cow's index, respectively, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with all `a_i`'s being pairwise different. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5; `x` is the value of the element at index `k` in the list `a` for each test case.**
