Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

The program's logic is as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 icons (`a`) and 2x2 icons (`b`).
3. It calculates the minimum number of screens required to place the 2x2 icons (`t`):
   - Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. Since the screen is 5x3 (15 cells), each screen can fit at most 3 2x2 icons (since 3 * 4 = 12, and the remaining 3 cells can't fit another 2x2 icon).
   - The calculation `t = b * 2` seems incorrect for determining the number of screens. It should be something like `t = b // 3` (integer division) to see how many full screens are needed for 2x2 icons, and then check for any remaining 2x2 icons.
4. It then calculates the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons and tries to place the 1x1 icons:
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` calculates the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1 >= a`, then no additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons.
   - If `t1 < a`, then it calculates how many more screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - The calculation `t2 = a - t1` is correct for the number of 1x1 icons left to place.
   - The calculation `t = t + t2 // 15 + 1` (if `t2 % 15 != 0`) is correct for adding additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

The main issue with the program is the incorrect calculation of the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. The program should correctly calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons and then proceed with placing the 1x1 icons.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        t = b // 3
        if b % 3 != 0:
            t += 1
        # Calculate remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = t * 15 - b * 4
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        if remaining_cells < a:
            t += (a - remaining_cells + 14) // 15
        print(t)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

Given the above analysis, the original program does not correctly calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons, leading to incorrect results for some test cases.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
