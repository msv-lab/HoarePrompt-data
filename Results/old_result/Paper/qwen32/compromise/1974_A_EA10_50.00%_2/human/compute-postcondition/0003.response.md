Functionality: **The function `func` takes no arguments but reads from standard input. It processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons, respectively. For each test case, the function calculates and returns the total area covered by the icons.**
