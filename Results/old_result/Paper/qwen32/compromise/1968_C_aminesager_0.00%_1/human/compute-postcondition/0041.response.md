To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop iterates over `range(1, n)`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, and `n` must be greater than 1.
- `a` has a new element appended, which is `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`.
- `T` remains unchanged.

Let's analyze the state adjustments needed for the next iteration:

1. **Variable `i`:**
   - In the previous iteration, `i` was used to access elements in `a` and `T`.
   - After the loop body executes, `i` is incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Since `n` must be greater than 1 and it does not change within the loop, `n` remains the same.

Given that `i` was some value at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote that value as `i_prev`. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize the state as follows:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `a` has a new element appended, which is `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`; `T` remains unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**

However, to match the format of the previous examples, we can denote the new value of `i` explicitly. If `i` was `i_prev` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

Assuming `i_prev` was 2 (as an example), the next value of `i` would be 3. But since we don't know the exact `i_prev`, we'll use a general form:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `a` has a new element appended, which is `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`; `T` remains unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**

If we assume `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `a` has a new element appended, which is `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`; `T` remains unchanged; `i` is 3.**

But to be general:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `a` has a new element appended, which is `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`; `T` remains unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**

For the sake of matching the format exactly:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `a` has a new element appended, which is `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`; `T` remains unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1.**

Thus, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `a` has a new element appended, which is `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`; `T` remains unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1.**
