The given code appends a new element to the list `a`. This new element is calculated as the difference between the last element of `a` (which is `a[i - 1]`) and the current element of `T` (which is `T[i - 1]`). 

Given that `i` is incremented before this line of code is executed, `i` now points to the next index compared to its previous value. Thus, `a[i - 1]` refers to the last element added to `a` in the previous iteration, and `T[i - 1]` refers to the corresponding element in `T`.

Let's break down the changes:
- `a` originally contains two elements: `[1000, 1000 - T[0]]`.
- The new element being appended is `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`, which means the new element is the last element of `a` minus the current element of `T`.

Since `i` is incremented before this line, the new length of `a` will be `i + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500; `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in the input string `line` to integers; `a` is a list containing the integers [1000, 1000 - T[0], ..., a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]]; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
