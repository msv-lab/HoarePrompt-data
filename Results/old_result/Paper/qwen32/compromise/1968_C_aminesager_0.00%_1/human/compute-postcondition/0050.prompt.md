Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t = t - 1
    n = int(input())
    line = input('')
    T = list(map(int, line.split()))
    a = [1000]
    for i in range(1, n):
        a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])
    a = a[::-1]
    result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500; `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in the input string `line` to integers; `a` is a list containing the integers [1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2], ..., 1000 - T[0] - T[1], 1000 - T[0], 1000] in reverse order; `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the newly input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500; `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in the input string `line` to integers; `a` is a list `[1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]), ..., 1000 - (T[0] + T[1]), 1000 - T[0], 1000]`; `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`; `line` is the newly input string; `i` is `n` and `result` is a space-separated string of the elements in `a`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a` is a reversed list with n elements where the i-th element (starting from 1) is 1000 minus the sum of the first (i-1) elements of T, in reverse order; `result` is a space-separated string of the elements in the reversed `a`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
