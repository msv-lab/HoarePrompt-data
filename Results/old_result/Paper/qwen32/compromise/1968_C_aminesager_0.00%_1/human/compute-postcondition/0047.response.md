The code snippet `a = a[::-1]` reverses the list `a`. Given the initial state, where `a` is a list with `n` elements where the i-th element is calculated as 1000 minus the sum of the first (i-1) elements of `T`, reversing the list `a` means that the order of these elements is flipped.

Output State: **`a` is a reversed list with n elements where the i-th element (starting from 1) is 1000 minus the sum of the first (i-1) elements of T, in reverse order; `result` is a space-separated string of the elements in the reversed `a`.**

In simpler terms, the list `a` has been flipped upside down, and `result` remains a space-separated string of these reversed elements.
