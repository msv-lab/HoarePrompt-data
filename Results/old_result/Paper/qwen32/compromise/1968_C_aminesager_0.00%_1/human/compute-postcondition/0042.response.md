The code appends a new element to the list `a`, which is calculated as `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`. This operation does not affect `n`, `T`, or the fact that `i` was incremented by 1 before this line of code was executed. The only change is that `a` now has one more element.

Given the initial state, `a` already had an element appended as `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]` before this line, and `i` was incremented. After executing the given line, `a` will have another element appended, making it two elements longer than its previous state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `a` has two new elements appended, which are `a[i - 2] - T[i - 2]` and `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`; `T` remains unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1.**
