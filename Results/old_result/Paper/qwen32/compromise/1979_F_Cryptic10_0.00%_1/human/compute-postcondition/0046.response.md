The code `path.append(v)` adds the value of `v` to the end of the list `path`. 

Given the initial state, `path` can either be `[v, v]` or `[v]` depending on whether `v` is in `remaining_vertices` or not. After appending `v`, the new state of `path` will be `[v, v, v]` if `v` was initially in `remaining_vertices`, or `[v, v]` if `v` was not in `remaining_vertices`.

No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(0)`. `path` is a list containing three vertices `[v, v, v]` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, or a list containing two vertices `[v, v]` if `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`. `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, or remains unchanged if `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`. `d` is 0. If `v` is 0, the state remains unchanged as described.**
