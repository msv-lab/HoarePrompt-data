To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the line `v, u = func_1(d)`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided initial state, we cannot determine the exact values of `v` and `u`. However, we can assume that `func_1` returns two values based on the input `d`.

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5.
- `path` is an empty list.
- `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n inclusive.
- `d` is n - 1.

After the execution of `v, u = func_1(d)`, the variables `v` and `u` will be assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`. The other variables (`n`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n inclusive; `d` is n - 1; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`**.
