The code snippet `v, u = func_1(d)` implies that the function `func_1` is called with the argument `d`, and the function returns two values which are assigned to the variables `v` and `u`. The initial state specifies that `d` is `x-1` where `x` is the value of `d` at the end of the previous iteration. This implies that `d` is being updated in each iteration, but its exact value is not provided.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine the exact values of `v` and `u`. However, we can describe the output state in terms of the function's return values.

Output State: **`d` is `x-1` where `x` is the value of `d` at the end of the previous iteration; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`**.

In simpler terms, `d` remains as `x-1` (where `x` is the value of `d` from the previous iteration), and `v` and `u` are the results of the function `func_1(d)`.
