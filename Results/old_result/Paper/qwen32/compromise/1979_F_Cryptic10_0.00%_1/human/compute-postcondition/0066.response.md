The code appends the value of `v` to the list `path`. Initially, `path` contains `[v, v]`. After appending `v` again, `path` will be `[v, v, v]`.

The value of `remaining_vertices` and other variables (`n`, `u`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`path` is a list `[v, v, v]`. If `v` is 0, then `path` is specifically `[0, 0, 0]` and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding 0. Otherwise, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v`. `n` must be at least 1, and `u` is assigned a value based on the function `func_1(d)`. Additionally, `v` is in `remaining_vertices`.**
