Output State: **`v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(0)`. `path` is a list containing three vertices `[v, v, v]` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices` (before removal), or a list containing two vertices `[v, v]` if `v` is not in `remaining_vertices` (before removal). `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` (now removed), or remains unchanged if `v` was not in `remaining_vertices`. `d` is 0. If `v` is 0, the state remains unchanged as described.**

In simpler terms: The value `v` has been removed from the set `remaining_vertices`. The list `path` and the values of `v`, `u`, and `d` remain unchanged.
