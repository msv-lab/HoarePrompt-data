Postcondition: **`v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(0)`. `path` is a list containing two vertices `[v, v]` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, or a list containing a single vertex `v` if `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`. `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, or remains unchanged if `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`. `d` is 0. If `v` is 0, the state remains unchanged as described.**
