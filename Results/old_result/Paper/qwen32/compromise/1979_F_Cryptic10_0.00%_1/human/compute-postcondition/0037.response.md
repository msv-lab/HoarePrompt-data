Postcondition: **`v` is the first value returned by `func_1(d)`, `u` is the second value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` is a list containing a single vertex `v`, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding the original `v` if `v` has been reassigned to a different value. Additionally, `v` is in `remaining_vertices`.**
