Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a graph, with the constraint that 2 <= n <= 100,000. It constructs a path that includes all vertices from 1 to n in some order and prints this path prefixed with an exclamation mark. After execution, the function outputs the vertices in the order they appear in the path list, ensuring all vertices are included exactly once.**
