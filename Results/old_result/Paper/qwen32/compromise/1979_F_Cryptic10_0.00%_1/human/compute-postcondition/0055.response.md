Output State: **If `v` is in `remaining_vertices` (before removal), `path` is `[v, v, v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices` (before removal), `path` is `[v, v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged. If `v` is 0, the state remains unchanged.**

Natural language explanation: The code removes `v` from `remaining_vertices` if `v` is in it. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` remains `[v, v, v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` will no longer contain `v`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, `path` remains `[v, v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` stays the same. If `v` is 0, there is no change to any variables.
