Output State: **`v` and `u` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`, `d` is decremented by 1, `path` and `remaining_vertices` are updated based on the new value of `v` returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the loop continues with the next iteration. Otherwise, the state remains as described without further changes. `path` now includes `v` at the end.**

Natural Language: The variable `path` now includes the value of `v` appended to it. All other variables (`v`, `u`, `d`, `path`, `remaining_vertices`) are updated according to the rules described, with `d` being decremented by 1 and `v` and `u` receiving new values from `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the loop will continue with the next iteration; otherwise, the state remains as previously described.
