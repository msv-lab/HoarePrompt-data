The code snippet provided is `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream. This operation does not affect the values of the variables `path` or `remaining_vertices`.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`path` is a list containing all vertices from 1 to n in some order, and `remaining_vertices` is an empty set.**
