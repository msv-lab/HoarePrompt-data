Based on the initial state provided, we have the following:

- `path` is a list containing all vertices from 1 to n in some order.
- `remaining_vertices` is an empty set (though this variable is not used in the print statement).

The print statement is:
```python
print(f"! {' '.join(map(str, path))}")
```

Let's break down what this print statement does:

1. `' '.join(map(str, path))`: This part of the code converts each element in the `path` list to a string and then joins them with a space (' ') separator.
2. `f"! {' '.join(map(str, path))}"`: This is an f-string that prepends an exclamation mark ('! ') to the joined string.

Since the exact order of vertices in the `path` list is not specified, we can describe the output in a general form.

Output: **! 1 2 3 ... n (where 1 2 3 ... n are the vertices in the order they appear in the path list)**

This means the output will be an exclamation mark followed by the vertices from 1 to n in the specific order they are arranged in the `path` list, separated by spaces.
