Postcondition: **`d` is `x-1` where `x` is the value of `d` at the end of the previous iteration; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is appended to `path` and `remaining_vertices` no longer contains `v`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `path` or `remaining_vertices`.**
