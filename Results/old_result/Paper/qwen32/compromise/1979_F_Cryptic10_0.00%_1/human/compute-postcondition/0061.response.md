To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the code `v, u = func_1(d)`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact values of `v` and `u` that will be assigned. However, we can infer that `v` and `u` will be assigned some values based on the input `d`.

Given the initial state:
- `path` is a list containing two vertices `[v, v]`
- `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v`
- `n` must be at least 1

After the execution of `v, u = func_1(d)`, the values of `v` and `u` will be updated. The values of `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged unless `func_1` modifies them, which is not indicated in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`path` is a list containing two vertices `[v, v]`, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v`, `n` must be at least 1, `v` and `u` are assigned values based on the function `func_1(d)`**.
