The only variable in the loop head is `d`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0` inclusive. The state of `d` before the loop starts does not matter because it is initialized by the `range` function. However, to ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be at least 1. If `n` is 0, the range would be empty, and the loop would not execute.

So, the state of `d` does not need to be adjusted manually, but `n` must be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. The state of `path` and `remaining_vertices` does not affect the execution of the loop directly, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

State: **`path` is a list containing a single vertex `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v`, `n` must be greater than 0**
