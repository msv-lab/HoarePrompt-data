Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n`, `m` must be greater than 0, and `k` is greater than 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is `2 * f + f`, `i` is `m`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are the integers read from the input.**

Natural language: The value of `a` has been updated to `2 * f + f`, which simplifies to `3 * f`. All other variables remain unchanged.
