The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to `m`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n`, `m` must be greater than 0, and `k` is greater than 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is `2 * f`, `i` is `m`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are the integers read from the input**
