The code snippet `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. This means the previous values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are overwritten with the new values read from the input.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `s`, `a`, `i`) are not affected by this line of code, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`; `s` is 0; `a` is `a + f`; `m` must be greater than 0; `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1.**
