To determine what will be printed by the `print(s % M)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the formula for `s`.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c` are given initial values.
- `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input.
- `i` is calculated as \( k + m + 1 \).
- `s` is calculated using the formula:
  \[
  s = k \cdot c \cdot a + \frac{k \cdot (k-1) \cdot c^2 \cdot m}{2}
  \]

### Calculation of `s`:
The value of `s` depends on the values of `k`, `c`, `a`, and `m`. Specifically:
- `k` is a given initial value.
- `c` is a given initial value.
- `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input.
- `m` is a given initial value.

### Calculation of `s % M`:
After calculating `s` using the formula, the code will print `s % M`. This means we need to take the modulus of `s` with `M`.

### Output Description:
Since the exact values of `k`, `c`, `a`, `m`, and `M` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `s % M`. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

The value of `s` is:
\[
s = k \cdot c \cdot a + \frac{k \cdot (k-1) \cdot c^2 \cdot m}{2}
\]

The output will be the result of `s % M`, which is:
\[
s \% M = \left( k \cdot c \cdot a + \frac{k \cdot (k-1) \cdot c^2 \cdot m}{2} \right) \% M
\]

### Final Output:
Output: **(k * c * a + (k * (k-1) * c^2 * m) / 2) % M (where k, c, a, m, and M are the given initial values and a is the sum of all f values read from the input)**
