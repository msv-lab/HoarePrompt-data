The code snippet `a += f` adds the value of `f` to the variable `a`. Given the initial state, `a` is initially set to `f`. After the operation, `a` will be `f + f`, which is `2 * f`.

Here are the variables and their states after the execution:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` remain greater than 0.
- `M` remains 1000000007.
- `c` remains the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`.
- `s` remains 0.
- `a` is now `2 * f`.
- `i` remains `m - 1`.
- `u`, `v`, and `f` remain the integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n`, `m` must be greater than 0, and `k` is greater than 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is `2 * f`, `i` is `m - 1`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are the integers read from the input.**
