### Reasoning:

The provided program seems to have a fundamental flaw in its logic for calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions. Let's break down the problem and the program to understand why.

#### Problem Understanding:
- **Objective**: Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for excursions.
- **Expected Output**: The expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers. The final output is \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9+7)\).

#### Key Points:
1. **Friendship Value Calculation**:
   - Initially, each friend pair has a given friendship value \(f_i\).
   - Each time a friend pair is chosen, its friendship value increases by 1.
   
2. **Probability**:
   - Each pair of children has an equal probability of being chosen, which is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).

3. **Expected Value**:
   - The expected number of times a specific friend pair is chosen in `k` excursions is \(k \times \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).
   - The expected increase in friendship value for a specific friend pair is \(\frac{k(k+1)}{n(n-1)}\).
   - The total expected sum of friendship values is the sum of the initial friendship values plus the expected increases.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program calculates `c` as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(10^9+7\). This is correct for converting probabilities into modular arithmetic.

However, the loop for calculating `s` is incorrect:
- The program iterates `k` times and adds `c * i * c * m + c * a` to `s`.
- This logic does not correctly reflect the expected value calculation as described above.

#### Correct Expected Value Calculation:
- For each friend pair `(u, v)`, the expected increase in friendship value is \(\frac{k(k+1)}{n(n-1)}\).
- The total expected sum `s` is the sum of initial friendship values plus the expected increases for all friend pairs.

#### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        
        # Modular multiplicative inverse of n*(n-1)//2
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        
        s = 0
        
        # Sum of initial friendship values
        initial_sum = 0
        
        for i in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            initial_sum += f
        
        # Expected increase in friendship value for each friend pair
        expected_increase = (k * (k + 1) // 2) * c % M
        
        # Total expected sum
        s = initial_sum + expected_increase * m
        
        print(s % M)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
