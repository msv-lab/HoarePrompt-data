Let's evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, the code, and the function summary.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - There are `n` children.
   - There are `m` pairs of friends with given initial friendship values.
   - The teacher conducts `k` excursions, choosing a pair of children randomly each time.
   - If a chosen pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.

2. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - For each pair of friends, the expected number of times they are chosen in `k` excursions is `k / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`, because there are `n * (n - 1) / 2` possible pairs.
   - The expected contribution of a pair to the total sum is the sum of an arithmetic series. If a pair's initial friendship value is `f`, and it is chosen `x` times, its contribution is `f + (f + 1) + ... + (f + x - 1) = x * f + (0 + 1 + ... + x - 1) = x * f + x * (x - 1) / 2`.
   - The expected contribution of a pair is therefore:
     \[
     \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \cdot f + \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \cdot \left(\frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} - 1\right) / 2
     \]
     where \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

3. **Summing Contributions:**
   - Sum this up for all pairs and convert the result to a fraction `p/q` where `p` and `q` are coprime, and find `p * q^-1 % (10^9 + 7)`.

### Program Analysis

Let's analyze the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)
```

1. **Initialization:**
   - `M` is set to `10^9 + 7`.
   - `c` is the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) / 2` modulo `M`.

2. **Accumulating Initial Friendship Values:**
   - `a` accumulates the sum of initial friendship values of all pairs.

3. **Calculating Expected Sum:**
   - The nested loop for `i` in `range(k)` seems to be incorrectly calculating the expected sum.
   - The inner loop should calculate the expected contribution of all pairs, not iterate `k` times.

### Correctness

The provided program has a fundamental issue in the way it calculates the expected sum. The inner loop for `i` in `range(k)` is incorrect. It should compute the expected contribution of all pairs in one go, not iterate `k` times.

The correct approach should involve calculating the expected contribution of each pair and summing them up, rather than iterating `k` times.

### Correct Calculation

1. **Expected Contribution of Each Pair:**
   - For a pair with initial friendship value `f`, the expected contribution is:
     \[
     \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \cdot f + \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \cdot \left(\frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} - 1\right) / 2
     \]
   - Simplify the above expression:
     \[
     \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \cdot f + \frac{k(k-1)}{2 \binom{n}{2}^2}
     \]

2. **Summing Contributions:**
   - Sum the contributions of all pairs:
     \[
     \sum_{\text{pairs}} \left( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \cdot f + \frac{k(k-1)}{2 \binom{n}{2}^2} \right)
     \]
   - This can be simplified to:
     \[
     \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \cdot \sum_{\text{pairs}} f + \frac{k(k-1)}{2 \binom{n}{2}^2} \cdot m
     \]
   - Where `a = \sum_{\text{pairs}} f` and `m` is the number of pairs.

3. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - Calculate the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Correct Program

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        s = (c * k * a) % M
        s = (s + (c * k * (k - 1) // 2) * (c * m) % M) % M
        print(s)

func()
```

### Conclusion

Given the issues in the provided program, the correctness is:

Final: **False**

The original program is incorrect due to the incorrect summation and calculation logic. The corrected program provided above should be used to solve the problem correctly.
