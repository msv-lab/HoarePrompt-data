The code snippet provided initializes the variable `s` to 0. The initial state of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `path`, and `a`) is not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and the path is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.'; `a` is an input integer; `s` is 0.**
