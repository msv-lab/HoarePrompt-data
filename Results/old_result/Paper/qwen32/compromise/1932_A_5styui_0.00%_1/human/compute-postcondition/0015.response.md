Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.', `a` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is 0, `d` is an input integer, and `b` is a string. If `b[j + 1]` is equal to '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change occurs to the variables.**
