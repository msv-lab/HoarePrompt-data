Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.'; `a` is greater than or equal to 1; `d` is the input integer; `b` is a non-empty string; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `s` is 0; `j` is the index of the character where the loop terminates; `b[j]` is not equal to '@' and `b[j]` is equal to '*'; `b[j + 1]` is equal to '*'; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of `t`, `n`, `path`, `a`, `d`, `b`, `i`, `s`, `j`, `b[j]`, and `b[j + 1]` remain unchanged. The loop or if statement is terminated due to the `break` statement.
