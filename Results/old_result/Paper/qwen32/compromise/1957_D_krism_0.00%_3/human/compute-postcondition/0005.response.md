The code appends the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]` to the `prefix` list. The value of `v` is not provided in the initial state, so we will denote the new element as `v ^ prefix[-1]`. The `prefix` list initially contains only one element, `0`, so `prefix[-1]` is `0`. This means the new element appended to `prefix` is `v ^ 0`, which simplifies to `v`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line and must have at least 1 integer, `prefix` is `[0, v]`**.
