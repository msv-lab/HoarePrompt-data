The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. If `i` is less than 32, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value less than 32 (since the loop is still running). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Given that the loop is currently at the end of an iteration, `i` must be adjusted to the next integer value in the range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line, `prefix` is `[0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)]`, `pre` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to `[0, 0]` except `pre[i][0]` which is 1, `suf` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to `[0, 0]`, `i` is the current value incremented by 1**.

Since the question doesn't specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can assume that `i` was `x` and now it should be `x + 1`. However, to match the format of the previous examples, we'll just state that `i` is incremented by 1.
