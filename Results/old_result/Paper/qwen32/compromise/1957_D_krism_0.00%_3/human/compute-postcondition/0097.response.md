The value of `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1. Given that `j` is 2, `suf[2][1]` is specifically decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged, and their initial states are preserved.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `y` is `arr[i - 1]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `c` is `prefix[i]`, `j` is 2, `pre[2][1]` is incremented by 1, `pre[0][1]` is unchanged, `pre[1][1]` is unchanged, `pre[2][0]` is unchanged, `suf[0][1]` is unchanged, `suf[0][0]` is unchanged, `suf[1][0]` is unchanged, `suf[2][0]` is unchanged, `suf[2][1]` is decremented by 1.**
