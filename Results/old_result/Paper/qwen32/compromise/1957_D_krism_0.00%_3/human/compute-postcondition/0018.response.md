The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the range of the loop, which is `32`. If `i` is less than `32`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus one.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `i` to be the next integer in the sequence.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line, `prefix` is `[0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)]`, `pre` is a list containing 32 sublists, where `pre[i][0]` is 2 and all other sublists are `[0, 0]` except their first element which is 1, `suf` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to `[0, 0]`, `i` is incremented by 1.**

Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus one.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line, `prefix` is `[0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)]`, `pre` is a list containing 32 sublists, where `pre[i][0]` is 2 and all other sublists are `[0, 0]` except their first element which is 1, `suf` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to `[0, 0]`, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus one.**

To make it clear, if `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it would be 1 at the start of the next iteration. If `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it would be 2 at the start of the next iteration, and so on.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line, `prefix` is `[0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)]`, `pre` is a list containing 32 sublists, where `pre[i][0]` is 2 and all other sublists are `[0, 0]` except their first element which is 1, `suf` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to `[0, 0]`, `i` is incremented by 1.**

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line, `prefix` is `[0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)]`, `pre` is a list containing 32 sublists, where `pre[i][0]` is 2 and all other sublists are `[0, 0]` except their first element which is 1, `suf` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to `[0, 0]`, `i` is 1.**

If `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line, `prefix` is `[0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)]`, `pre` is a list containing 32 sublists, where `pre[i][0]` is 2 and all other sublists are `[0, 0]` except their first element which is 1, `suf` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to `[0, 0]`, `i` is 2.**

And so on. The general state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line, `prefix` is `[0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)]`, `pre` is a list containing 32 sublists, where `pre[i][0]` is 2 and all other sublists are `[0, 0]` except their first element which is 1, `suf` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to `[0, 0]`, `i` is incremented by 1.**

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus one.

So, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line, `prefix` is `[0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)]`, `pre` is a list containing 32 sublists, where `pre[i][0]` is 2 and all other sublists are `[0, 0]` except their first element which is 1, `suf` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to `[0, 0]`, `i` is `x + 1`.**

Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line, `prefix` is `[0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)]`, `pre` is a list containing 32 sublists, where `pre[i][0]` is 2 and all other sublists are `[0, 0]` except their first element which is 1, `suf` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to `[0, 0]`, `i` is incremented by 1.**

If `i` was 0 at the end
