The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`. The loop will execute if `j` is less than 32 at the start of the loop. The initial value of `j` is given as 32, which means the loop will not execute with this initial state. To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust `j` to be less than 32.

State: **`t` is unchanged, `ans` is `3 * (pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1])`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 2`, `y` is `arr[i - 1]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `c` is `prefix[i]`, `j` is less than 32**
