The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, which means `i` has already been incremented. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented again by 1 from its current value.

Given that `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 2`.

State: **`t` is unchanged, `ans` is `2 * (pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1])`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 2`, `y` is `arr[i - 1]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `c` is `prefix[i]`, `j` is 32**
