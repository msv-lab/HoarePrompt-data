The code snippet `c = prefix[i]` assigns the value of `prefix[i]` to the variable `c`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `y` is `arr[i - 1]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `c` is `prefix[i]`**.
