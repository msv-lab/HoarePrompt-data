The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range limit `32`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `j` for the next iteration of the loop. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `32`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by `1`.

State: **`t` is unchanged, `ans` is `2 * (pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1])`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `y` is `arr[i - 1]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `c` is `prefix[i]`, `j` is 1. If the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, then `pre[0][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[0][1]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decremented by 1.**
