The code appends the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]` to the `prefix` list. Given the initial state, `prefix` is `[0, v]`, so `prefix[-1]` is `v`. Therefore, the new element appended to `prefix` is `v ^ v`, which is `0`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line and must have at least 2 integers, `prefix` is `[0, v, 0]`, `v` is the next element in `arr`.**
