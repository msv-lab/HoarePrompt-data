The code snippet calculates the bit length of `y` and subtracts 1 from it, assigning the result to `k`. The values of `t`, `ans`, `n`, and `y` remain unchanged except for the assignment to `k`.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `ans` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `y` is `arr[i - 1]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`**.
