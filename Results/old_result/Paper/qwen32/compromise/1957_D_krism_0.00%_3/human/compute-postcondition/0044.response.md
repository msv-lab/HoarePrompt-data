The code snippet provided increments the count of how many times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 0 in the `suf` list. Since the `j`-th bit of `cur` is 0, the value of `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1. No other variables are affected by this statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line, `prefix` is `[0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)]`, `pre` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to `[1, 0]`, `cur` is `prefix[i - 1]`, `suf[j][0]` is the count of how many times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 0 across all iterations plus 1, `suf[j][1]` is the count of how many times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 1 across all iterations, `i` is `i - 1`, and the `j`-th bit of `cur` is 0.**
