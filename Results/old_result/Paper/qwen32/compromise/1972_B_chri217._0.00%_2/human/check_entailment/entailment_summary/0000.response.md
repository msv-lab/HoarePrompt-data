### Reasoning:
The problem revolves around determining the winner of a game based on the number of facing-up coins ("U") in a circular arrangement. The key observation here is that the game's outcome is entirely dependent on whether the number of facing-up coins is odd or even.

- If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win.
- If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will win.

This conclusion is derived from the fact that each move by a player removes one facing-up coin and flips the adjacent ones. The parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins remains invariant under the game's operations. Therefore, the initial count of facing-up coins dictates who will be the last to make a move, thus winning the game.

The provided Python program correctly implements this logic by counting the number of 'U's in the string and checking if this count is odd or even. If the count is odd, it returns 'YES', indicating Alice's win; otherwise, it returns 'NO', indicating Bob's win.
