Correctness: **True**

**Explanation:**

The provided program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins ("U") in the string `s`. The strategy hinges on the observation that if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always win if both players play optimally. Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will always win under optimal play.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Counting the Facing-Up Coins:**
   - The function `func_1(s)` counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s`.
   - If the count is odd, Alice wins, so the function returns 'YES'.
   - If the count is even, Bob wins, so the function returns 'NO'.

2. **Game Dynamics:**
   - Each move removes one facing-up coin and flips the adjacent coins.
   - The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always make the last move, ensuring she wins.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can mirror Alice's moves, ensuring he wins.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the minimum and maximum constraints for `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).
   - It correctly processes strings with all 'U's, all 'D's, and mixed 'U's and 'D's.

Given these points, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
