### Reasoning:
The given problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of the coins. The key insight is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins ('U') in the initial configuration. If the number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice will win; otherwise, Bob will win. This is because each move flips two adjacent coins, which preserves the parity of the number of 'U' coins. Therefore, if the number of 'U' coins is odd initially, Alice can always force a win by maintaining the odd parity until the end, ensuring that Bob is left with an even number of 'U' coins when it's his turn, and eventually, Bob will be unable to make a move when all 'U' coins are gone.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by counting the number of 'U' coins in the string `s` and checking if this count is odd or even. If the count is odd, it returns 'YES', indicating that Alice will win; otherwise, it returns 'NO', indicating that Bob will win.
