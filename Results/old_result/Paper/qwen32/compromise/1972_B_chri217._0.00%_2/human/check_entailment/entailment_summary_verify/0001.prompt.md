You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[1])
    s = data[2]
    print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    num_up = s.count('U')
    if num_up % 2 == 1:
        return 'YES'
    else:
        return 'NO'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of characters "U" and "D". It returns 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the string is odd, otherwise it returns 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The key to solving this problem lies in the observation of the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins. Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Game Dynamics**:
   - Each operation removes one facing-up coin and flips the adjacent coins.
   - If there are only two coins left and one is facing up, it will be removed, and the other won't be flipped.
   - If there is only one coin left, no coins will be flipped.
   - If there are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

2. **Parity Analysis**:
   - Each operation reduces the number of facing-up coins by one.
   - Flipping the adjacent coins does not change the parity of the number of facing-up coins. If there were an odd number of facing-up coins before the operation, there will still be an odd number after the operation (minus one).
   - If the initial number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always ensure that she is the one to make the last move, because the parity will change from odd to even, even to odd, and so on, with Alice always taking the odd turns.
   - Conversely, if the initial number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will make the last move, and Alice will lose.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Alice wins if the number of facing-up coins is odd.
   - Bob wins if the number of facing-up coins is even.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by counting the number of 'U' characters in the input string and checking if this count is odd or even. If the count is odd, it returns 'YES', indicating that Alice will win; otherwise, it returns 'NO', indicating that Bob will win.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
