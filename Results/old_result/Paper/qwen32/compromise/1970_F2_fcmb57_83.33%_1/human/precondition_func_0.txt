a is an integer representing the number of lines (N) in the field, where 3 <= N <= 99 and N is odd. b is an integer representing the number of columns (M) in the field, where 3 <= M <= 99 and M is odd. The field is a list of N strings, each containing M pairs of characters separated by spaces. Each pair of characters can be ".." for an empty cell, "R0", ..., "R9", "B0", ..., "B9" for players, "RG" or "BG" for goals, ".Q" for the Quaffle, or ".B" for the Bludger. There is exactly one Quaffle and at least one goal for each team. The number of steps (T) is an integer where 0 <= T <= 10000. The next T lines describe the actions of the entities, where each action is a pair of characters representing the entity followed by a valid action (U, D, L, R, C <ball>, T).
