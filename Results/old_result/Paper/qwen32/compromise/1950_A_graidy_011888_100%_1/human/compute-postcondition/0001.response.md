The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not directly related to the execution of the for loop, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The value of `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it gets initialized by the `range(n)` function in the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; `n` must be greater than 0**
