Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, the array should be rearranged such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

The given program instead calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array, which does not correspond to the required beauty calculation. To illustrate, let's consider a test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5
100 54 80 43 90
```

**Expected Output:**
```
57
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
To maximize the beauty, we can rearrange the array as [43, 54, 80, 90, 100]. The beauty is calculated as:
(54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57.

**Actual Output of Provided Program:**
```
97
```

The provided program calculates the difference between the maximum (100) and minimum (43) values of the array, which is 57, but this is not the correct way to compute the beauty as described in the problem. The program is not implementing the required logic to maximize the beauty of the array by considering the differences between consecutive elements in an optimal arrangement.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
