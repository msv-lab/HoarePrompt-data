Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is an integer such that `l` must be greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `e` is `e + 1`, `y` is `nums[i]`, `x` is `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is greater than `x`; otherwise, `x` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`.**

In natural language: The value of `y` is now updated to `nums[i]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged except for `y`, which now holds the value of `nums[i]`.
