The code snippet assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `y`. The values of other variables like `t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `e`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 before this line of code, the value of `y` is now the element at the index `i` in the list `nums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is an integer such that `l` must be greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `e` is `e + 1`, `y` is `nums[i]`, `x` is updated to `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is greater than `x`; otherwise, `x` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1.**
