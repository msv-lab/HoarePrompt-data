The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `l`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `l`. If `i` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` becomes 2. The value of `l` should remain the same to determine if the loop should continue executing.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 2. If `nums[2]` is greater than `x`, `x` is updated to `nums[2]`. If `nums[2] < y`, `y` is updated to `nums[2]`. Otherwise, `y` remains unchanged.**
