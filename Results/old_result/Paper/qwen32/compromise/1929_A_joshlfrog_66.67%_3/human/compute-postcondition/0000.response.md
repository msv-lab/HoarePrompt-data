The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and it will now hold the value of the input. The other variables `n` and `a` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The value of `t` has been updated to the integer input.**
