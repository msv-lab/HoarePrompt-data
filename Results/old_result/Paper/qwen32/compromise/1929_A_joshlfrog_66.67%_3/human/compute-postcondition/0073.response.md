Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and the loop has completed `t` iterations. For each iteration `e` (where 0 <= e < t), an integer `l` was read, followed by a list `nums` of `l` integers. The loop printed the difference between the maximum (`x`) and minimum (`y`) values in `nums` for each iteration.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop have completed, the variable `t` remains the same, representing the total number of iterations the loop performed. The variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop. For each of the `t` iterations, an integer `l` and a list of `l` integers `nums` were read. The loop calculated and printed the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `nums` for each iteration.
