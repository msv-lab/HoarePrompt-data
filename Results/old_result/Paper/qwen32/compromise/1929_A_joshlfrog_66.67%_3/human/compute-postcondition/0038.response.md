The code snippet `x = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `x`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `e`, `y`, and the other elements of `nums` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is an integer such that `l` must be greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `e` is `e + 1`, `y` remains unchanged, `x` is `nums[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
