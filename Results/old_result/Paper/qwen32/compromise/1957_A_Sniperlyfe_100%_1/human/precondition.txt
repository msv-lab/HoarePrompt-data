arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases, followed by pairs of integers where the first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) in each pair represents the number of sticks available, and the next n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) represent the lengths of the sticks for that test case.
