Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string as per the problem description. The program attempts to map each character in the encoded string to a unique character from 'a' to 'z' in the order of their first appearance, which is not the decoding process described in the problem.

The correct decoding process involves:
1. Identifying the unique characters in the encoded string and sorting them alphabetically to form the string `r`.
2. Creating a mapping where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second to the second last, and so on).
3. Using this mapping to decode the encoded string.

The provided code does not follow these steps. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
