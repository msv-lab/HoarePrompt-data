Postcondition: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least two characters, `char` is `next_char`, and `c` is unchanged. If `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, then `mapping[chr(c)]` is set to `char` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no further changes are made to `mapping`.**
