The code snippet assigns the value of `char` to the key `chr(c)` in the `mapping` dictionary. 

Given the initial state:
- `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least two characters.
- `char` is `next_char`.
- `c` is `c + 1` where `c + 1` is within the range `[ord('a'), ord('z')]`.

After executing the line `mapping[chr(c)] = char`, the `mapping` dictionary will have a new entry where the key is the character representation of `c` and the value is `char`.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least two characters; `char` is `next_char`; `c` is `c + 1` where `c + 1` is within the range `[ord('a'), ord('z')]`; `mapping` has a new entry `{chr(c): next_char}`.**
