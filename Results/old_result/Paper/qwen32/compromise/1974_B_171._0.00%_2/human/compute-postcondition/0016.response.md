The code snippet `mapping[chr(c)] = char` adds an entry to the `mapping` dictionary where the key is the character corresponding to the ASCII value `c` (which is 98) and the value is the variable `char`. Since `chr(98)` is the character 'b', the dictionary `mapping` now includes the entry `'b': char`.

Given that `char` is not in `mapping` initially (except for the new entry if added), after this operation, `mapping` will have `'b'` mapped to `char`.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is not in `mapping` (except for the new entry `'b': char`), `c` is 98, `mapping` includes the entry `'b': char`.**
