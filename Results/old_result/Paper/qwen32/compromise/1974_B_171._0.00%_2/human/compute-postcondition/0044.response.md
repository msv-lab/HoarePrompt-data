The code snippet adds a new key-value pair to the `mapping` dictionary where the key is `chr(c)` and the value is `char`. Given that `c` is 97, `chr(c)` evaluates to 'a'. Therefore, the key 'a' is added to the `mapping` dictionary with the value `char`.

Output State: **`c` is 97, and `mapping` now includes the key-value pair `'a': char`**.
