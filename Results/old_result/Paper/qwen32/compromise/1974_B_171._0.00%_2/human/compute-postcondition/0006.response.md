The only object in the loop head is the variable `c`, which iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`. This means `c` will take on integer values from 97 (`ord('a')`) to 122 (`ord('z')`).

Given the loop head, the state of `c` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because the `for` loop will automatically initialize `c` to the starting value of the range (97 in this case) when the loop begins.

The other variables mentioned (`encoded`, `mapping`, `decoded`, and `char`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `decoded` is an empty list, and `char` is not in `mapping`**
