The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `encoded`, `char`, `c`, and `mapping` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least two characters; `char` is `next_char`; `c` is `c + 1` where `c + 1` is within the range `[ord('a'), ord('z')]`; `mapping` has a new entry `{chr(c): next_char}`.**
