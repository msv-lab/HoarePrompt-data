The only variable in the loop head is `c`, so we can only adjust that. According to the code, the loop iterates over a range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`, which means `c` takes on values from the ASCII value of 'a' to 'z'. At the end of the previous iteration, `c` would have taken on a specific value within this range.

For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be incremented by 1, provided it is still within the range. If `c` is already at `ord('z')`, the loop will terminate.

Let's assume `c` was at some value `x` at the end of the last iteration, where `ord('a') <= x <= ord('z')`. For the next iteration, `c` should be `x + 1`, provided `x + 1 <= ord('z')`.

Given the information, if `c` was at `ord('z')` in the last iteration, the loop would terminate, and there would be no next iteration. Otherwise, `c` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `decoded` is an empty list, and `char` is not in `mapping` (except for the new entry if added). If `chr(c)` was not in the values of `mapping`, `mapping` now contains one entry `{chr(c): char}` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `mapping` remains unchanged. `c` is incremented by 1**.

To be more specific, if `c` was `ord('z')` in the last iteration, the loop would terminate. Otherwise, `c` should be `c + 1`.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `decoded` is an empty list, and `char` is not in `mapping` (except for the new entry if added). If `chr(c)` was not in the values of `mapping`, `mapping` now contains one entry `{chr(c): char}` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `mapping` remains unchanged. `c` is `c + 1`**.

Since we need to ensure `c` is within the valid range, we can specify:
