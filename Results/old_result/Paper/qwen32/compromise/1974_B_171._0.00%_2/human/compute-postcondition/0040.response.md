The only variable in the loop head is `char`, which iterates over each character in the `encoded` string. Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `char` is `next_char`. To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to determine what `char` will be next in the `encoded` string.

Since `char` is currently `next_char`, the next value of `char` in the next iteration will be the character that follows `next_char` in the `encoded` string. Let's denote this next character as `next_next_char`.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least two characters, and `char` is `next_next_char`. If `char` is in `mapping`, `decoded` has an additional element `mapping[next_next_char]` appended to it. Otherwise, `c` is the ASCII value of the first character from 'a' to 'z' that was not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` includes the entry `{chr(c): next_next_char}`, and `decoded` now contains the character `chr(c)`**.
