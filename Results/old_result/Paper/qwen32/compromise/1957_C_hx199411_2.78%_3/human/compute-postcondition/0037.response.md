To determine the new state after executing the given line of code, we need to focus on the calculation of `dp[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 4, and `dp` is a list with `dp[1]` set to 1 and `dp[2]` set to 3. The formula to update `dp[i]` is:

\[ dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]

Substituting `i = 4` into the formula:

\[ dp[4] = (dp[3] + (4 - 1) \times dp[2] \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[4] = (dp[3] + 3 \times 3 \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[4] = (dp[3] + 18) \% (10^9 + 7) \]

Since `dp[3]` was not explicitly initialized in the initial state, we assume it remains 0 unless otherwise specified. Thus:

\[ dp[4] = (0 + 18) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[4] = 18 \% (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ dp[4] = 18 \]

The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`, and the rest of the `dp` list remain unchanged except for `dp[4]`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is the second integer read from the input, such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`; `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on whether `c` equals `r` in each of the `k` iterations; `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be at least 3; `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[4]` which is 18; `i` is 4**
