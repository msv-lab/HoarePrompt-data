Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is greater than 0; `num` is 2; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input, and `c` is not equal to `r`.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been incremented by 2, making its new value 2. All other variables retain their initial values.
