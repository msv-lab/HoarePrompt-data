The code snippet assigns the value `3` to `dp[2]`. This means that the element at index `2` of the list `dp` is now `3`. All other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is the second integer read from the input, such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`; `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on whether `c` equals `r` in each of the `k` iterations; `m` is `n - num` and `m` is not equal to 0; `m` is not equal to 1; `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3.**
