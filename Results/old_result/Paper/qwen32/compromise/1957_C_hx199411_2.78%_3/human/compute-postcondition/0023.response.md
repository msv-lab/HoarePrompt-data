To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variable `num` based on the values of `c` and `r` provided in each iteration.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. The loop runs `k` times.
2. For each iteration, it reads two integers `c` and `r`.
3. If `c` equals `r`, it increments `num` by 1.
4. If `c` does not equal `r`, it increments `num` by 2.

Given this behavior, after `k` iterations, `num` will be the sum of 1s and 2s, depending on whether `c` was equal to `r` in each iteration.

Let's formalize this:

- Let `x` be the number of times `c` equals `r` during the `k` iterations.
- Let `y` be the number of times `c` does not equal `r` during the `k` iterations.
- Clearly, `x + y = k`.

The value of `num` after `k` iterations can be expressed as:
\[ \text{num} = x \times 1 + y \times 2 = x + 2y \]

Since `x + y = k`, we can substitute `y` with `k - x`:
\[ \text{num} = x + 2(k - x) = x + 2k - 2x = 2k - x \]

Thus, the final value of `num` depends on the number of times `c` equals `r` (denoted by `x`). However, without knowing the exact values of `c` and `r` in each iteration, we can only express the final state in terms of `k` and `x`.

However, since we are asked to provide the final state after all iterations, and given that `x` is a count of specific conditions met during the iterations, we can summarize the final state as follows:

- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `num` is the result of the described accumulation process.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is the second integer read from the input, such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`; `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on whether `c` equals `r` in each of the `k` iterations.**

In simpler terms, `num` is the total increment accumulated over `k` iterations, where each match (`c == r`) adds 1 to `num` and each mismatch (`c != r`) adds 2 to `num`.
