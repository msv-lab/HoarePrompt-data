The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. The previous values of `c` and `r` are overwritten by the new input values. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is greater than 0; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1.**
