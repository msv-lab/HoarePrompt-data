To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variables change with each iteration and then generalize it for `k` iterations.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is the first integer read from the input
- `k` is the second integer read from the input (number of iterations)
- `num` is 0
- `m` is `n - num`

### Loop Iteration Changes:
For each iteration (`i` from 0 to `k-1`):
- Read two integers `c` and `r` from the input.
- If `c == r`, increment `num` by 1.
- If `c != r`, increment `num` by 2.
- Update `m` to `n - num`.

### Final State After All Iterations:
After `k` iterations:
- `t` remains `t - 1` as it is not modified inside the loop.
- `n` remains the same as it is not modified inside the loop.
- `k` remains the same as it is used as the loop counter.
- `num` will be the sum of increments based on the conditions inside the loop.
- `m` will be `n - num`.

### Calculation of `num`:
- For each iteration, `num` increases by either 1 or 2.
- Let's denote the total increase in `num` after `k` iterations as `total_increase`.
- `total_increase` depends on the specific values of `c` and `r` read during each iteration.

### Final Output State:
- `t` is still `t - 1`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `k` remains the same.
- `num` is the cumulative sum of increments (either 1 or 2) over `k` iterations.
- `m` is `n - num`.

### Conclusion:
The final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is the cumulative sum of increments (1 or 2) over `k` iterations, and `m` is `n - num`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, `k` remains the number of iterations, `num` is the total count of increments based on the conditions inside the loop, and `m` is adjusted accordingly.
