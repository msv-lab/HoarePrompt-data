The given code snippet resets the variable `num` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is 0, `m` is `n - num`.** 

This means that `num` has been reset to 0, and `m` now reflects the new value of `num` (which is `n - 0` or simply `n`). All other variables retain their initial values.
