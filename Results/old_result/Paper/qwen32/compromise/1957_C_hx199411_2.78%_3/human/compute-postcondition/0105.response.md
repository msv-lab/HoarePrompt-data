The code snippet `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. Given the initial state, `num` is either 2 or 4 depending on whether `c` equals `r`. After the increment, `num` will be either 4 or 6.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is either 4 or 6, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros with `dp[1]` set to 1, `dp[2]` set to 3, `dp[3]` set to 7, `dp[4]` set to 25, and `dp[5]` set to 81 if `m` is at least 5, `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`.**

In natural language: The value of `num` has been incremented by 2, so it is now either 4 or 6. All other variables remain unchanged.
