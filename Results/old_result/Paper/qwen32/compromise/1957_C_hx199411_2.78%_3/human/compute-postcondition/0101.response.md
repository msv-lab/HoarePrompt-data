Postcondition: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is 2 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 4, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros with `dp[1]` set to 1, `dp[2]` set to 3, `dp[3]` set to 7, `dp[4]` set to 25, and `dp[5]` set to 81 if `m` is at least 5, `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input, `i` is incremented by 1.**
