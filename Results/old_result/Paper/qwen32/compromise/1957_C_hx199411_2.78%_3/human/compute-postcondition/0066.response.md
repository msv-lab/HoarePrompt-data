The code snippet provided is `m = n - num`. This line updates the value of `m` based on the current values of `n` and `num`.

Given the Initial State:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is the first integer read from the input
- `k` is the second integer read from the input
- `num` is the cumulative sum of increments (1 or 2) over `k` iterations
- `m` is `n - num`

After executing `m = n - num`, the value of `m` is recalculated as `n - num`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `num`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is the cumulative sum of increments (1 or 2) over `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num`.**
