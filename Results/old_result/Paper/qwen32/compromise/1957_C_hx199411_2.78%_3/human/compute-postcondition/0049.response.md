The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. This affects only the variables `c` and `r`, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` must be greater than 0, `num` is 0, `m` is `n - num`, `c` is the first integer read from the second input pair, `r` is the second integer read from the second input pair.**
