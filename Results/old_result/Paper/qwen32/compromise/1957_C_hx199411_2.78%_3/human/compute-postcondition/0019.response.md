The code snippet `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `r`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `num` was not explicitly defined, but since it is being incremented, we can infer that it had some initial value before this operation. After the increment, its new value is its previous value plus 1.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is greater than 0; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1; `num` is its previous value plus 1.**
