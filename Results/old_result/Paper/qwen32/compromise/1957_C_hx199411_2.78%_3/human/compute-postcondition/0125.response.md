Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

- `t` is at least 0 (not directly relevant to the print statement).
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input (not directly relevant to the print statement).
- `num` is calculated as `2k - x`, where `x` is the number of times `c == r` during `k` iterations (not directly relevant to the print statement).
- `m` is at least 3.
- `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros, except:
  - `dp[1]` is set to 1.
  - `dp[2]` is set to 3.
  - All `dp[i]` for `i` from 6 to `m` are set to 0.
- `i` is set to `m + 1` (not directly relevant to the print statement).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(dp[m])
```

### Analysis:
We need to determine the value of `dp[m]`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `dp` is initialized with `m + 1` elements, all set to 0.
- `dp[1]` is explicitly set to 1.
- `dp[2]` is explicitly set to 3.
- For indices from 6 to `m`, `dp[i]` is set to 0.

However, there is no information provided about the values of `dp[i]` for indices between 3 and 5, nor any indication that these values are modified after their initial assignment of 0. Therefore, we can assume that `dp[i]` for `i` in the range 3 to 5 remains 0 unless stated otherwise.

Given that `m` is at least 3, and considering the information provided, if `m` is 3, 4, or 5, then `dp[m]` would be 0 because those indices were not explicitly set to any other value.

### Conclusion:
Based on the given initial state, the value of `dp[m]` for `m` being at least 3 and not explicitly set to another value in the range 3 to 5 is 0.

Output: **0**
