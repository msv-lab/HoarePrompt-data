The code increments the value of `num` by 1. Given the initial state, `num` was either 1 (if `c` equals `r`) or 2 (if `c` does not equal `r`). After incrementing, `num` will be either 2 or 3 respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is either 2 or 3, `m` is `n - num`, `c` and `r` are the new integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`.**
