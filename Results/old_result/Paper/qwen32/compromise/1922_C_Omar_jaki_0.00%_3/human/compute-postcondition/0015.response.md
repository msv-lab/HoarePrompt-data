Let's analyze the given code snippet and determine the new state of the variables.

The initial state provides us with:
- `t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1.
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of \(n+2\) integers starting with \(-1000000000.0\), followed by the original \(n\) integers, and ending with \(2000000000.0\).
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\).
- `b` is a list `[0, 0, v, v, b[-2] + v]`, which translates to `[0, 0, v, v, v + v]` or `[0, 0, v, v, 2v]`.
- `v` is `y - x`.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
```

Let's break down what this does:
- `b[-2]` refers to the second last element of `b`, which is `v`.
- `b[-1]` refers to the last element of `b`, which is `2v`.
- `v ** (v > x - w)` evaluates to `v` if `v > x - w` is `True`, otherwise it evaluates to `1`. Since `v` is `y - x`, this simplifies to `v` if `y - x > x - w` or `y + w > 2x`, otherwise `1`.
- Similarly, `v ** (v > z - y)` evaluates to `v` if `v > z - y` is `True`, otherwise it evaluates to `1`. This simplifies to `v` if `y - x > z - y` or `2y > x + z`, otherwise `1`.

Thus, the new elements added to `b` are:
- `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)` which is `v + v` if `y + w > 2x`, otherwise `v + 1`.
- `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)` which is `2v + v` if `2y > x + z`, otherwise `2v + 1`.

Therefore, the updated list `b` will be:
- If both conditions are true (`y + w > 2x` and `2y > x + z`), `b` becomes `[0, 0, v, v, 2v, 2v, 3v]`.
- If `y + w > 2x` is true and `2y > x + z` is false, `b` becomes `[0, 0, v, v, 2v, 2v, 2v + 1]`.
- If `y + w > 2x` is false and `2y > x + z` is true, `b` becomes `[0, 0, v, v, 2v, v + 1, 3v]`.
- If both conditions are false (`y + w > 2x` and `2y > x + z`), `b` becomes `[0, 0, v, v, 2v, v + 1, 2v + 1]`.

Since the exact values of `x`, `y`, `w`, and `z` are not provided, we cannot definitively determine which condition holds. However, we can express the final state in terms of these conditions.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of \(n+2\) integers starting with \(-1000000000.0\), followed by the original \(n\) integers, and ending with \(2000000000.0\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\), `b` is `[0, 0, v, v, 2v, v + v ** (v > x - w), 2v + v ** (v > z - y)]`, `v` is `y - x`.**
