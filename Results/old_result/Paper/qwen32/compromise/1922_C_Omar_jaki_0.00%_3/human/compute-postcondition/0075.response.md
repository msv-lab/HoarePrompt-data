To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `a`: This is a list that contains several values followed by `2000000000.0`. The exact values before `2000000000.0` are not specified.
- `u`: This variable is adjusted by subtracting 1 from its previous value (`u = u - 1`). However, the initial value of `u` is not provided, so we cannot determine its current value.
- `t`: This variable is explicitly set to `False`.
- `b`: This is a list with three elements: `[0, 0, accumulated_values_based_on_conditions]`. The third element is described as `accumulated_values_based_on_conditions`, but its exact value is not provided.
- `c`: This variable holds `return_value_1`, which is not explicitly defined in the initial state.
- `d`: This variable holds `return_value_2`, which is also not explicitly defined in the initial state.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

Given the structure of the list `b`, which has only three elements, we need to consider the indices that can be accessed:
- `b[0]` corresponds to the first element, which is `0`.
- `b[1]` corresponds to the second element, which is `0`.
- `b[2]` corresponds to the third element, which is `accumulated_values_based_on_conditions`.

The expression `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2` must result in valid indices for the list `b` (i.e., 0, 1, or 2). Since `b` only has three elements, the only valid indices are 0 and 2 (because 1 would be out of bounds if `c` or `d` were 1).

Let's analyze the possible scenarios:
1. If `d` and `c` are both 1:
   - `(d - 1) * 2` evaluates to `0`.
   - `(c - 1) * 2` evaluates to `0`.
   - The expression becomes `b[0] - b[0]`, which is `0 - 0 = 0`.

2. If `d` is 1 and `c` is 2:
   - `(d - 1) * 2` evaluates to `0`.
   - `(c - 1) * 2` evaluates to `2`.
   - The expression becomes `b[0] - b[2]`, which is `0 - accumulated_values_based_on_conditions`.

3. If `d` is 2 and `c` is 1:
   - `(d - 1) * 2` evaluates to `2`.
   - `(c - 1) * 2` evaluates to `0`.
   - The expression becomes `b[2] - b[0]`, which is `accumulated_values_based_on_conditions - 0`.

4. If `d` and `c` are both 2:
   - `(d - 1) * 2` evaluates to `2`.
   - `(c - 1) * 2` evaluates to `2`.
   - The expression becomes `b[2] - b[2]`, which is `accumulated_values_based_on_conditions - accumulated_values_based_on_conditions = 0`.

Since the exact values of `c` and `d` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical output. However, based on the possible scenarios, the output can be described as follows:

### Final Output:
Output: **0 or accumulated_values_based_on_conditions or -accumulated_values_based_on_conditions (depending on the values of c and d)**
