t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case in test_cases is a tuple containing three parts: (n, a, queries). Here, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, a is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9, and queries is a list of m tuples where each tuple (x_i, y_i) satisfies 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n and x_i != y_i, with m being an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. Additionally, for each city in each test case, the closest city is uniquely determined.
