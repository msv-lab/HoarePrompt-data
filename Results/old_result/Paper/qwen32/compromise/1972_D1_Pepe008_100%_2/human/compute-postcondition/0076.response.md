Postcondition: **`i` is `i + 1`, `b` remains unchanged, `x` is calculated as \(\left(\frac{a - (i + 1) \cdot ((i + 1) - 1)}{(i + 1)^2}\right) + 1\). If \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0\), then `suma` is increased by `x + 1` if \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\); otherwise, `suma` is increased by `x`.**
