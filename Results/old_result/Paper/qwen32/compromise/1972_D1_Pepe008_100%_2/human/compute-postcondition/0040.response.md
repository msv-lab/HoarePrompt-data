The value of `x` is recalculated using the new formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged except for `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `suma` is 0, `t` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `T`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and `b` must be at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`.

Output State: **`suma` is 0, `t` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `T`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and `b` must be at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`.**
