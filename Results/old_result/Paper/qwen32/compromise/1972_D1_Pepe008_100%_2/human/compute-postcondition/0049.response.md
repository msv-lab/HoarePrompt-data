Postcondition: **`suma` is the previous value of `suma` plus `x` plus 1 if `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0`, otherwise `suma` is the previous value of `suma` plus `x`. In both cases, `t` is incremented by 1 and is less than `T`, `info` is a list of strings, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and `b` is at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.**
