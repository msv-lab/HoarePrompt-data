Let's calculate the new value of `x` based on the provided code snippet and initial state.

The initial value of `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. Given that `i` is 4, this simplifies to `(a - 4 * 3) // 4` or `(a - 12) // 4`.

The new calculation for `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`, which simplifies to `(a - 4 * 3) // 16 + 1` or `(a - 12) // 16 + 1`.

Let's denote the new value of `x` as `x_new`.

So, `x_new = (a - 12) // 16 + 1`.

The values of `suma`, `t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`suma` is 0, `t` is 3, `T` is greater than `t`, `info` is a list of strings based on the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and `b` is at least 1, `x` is `(a - 12) // 16 + 1`, `i` is 4**.
