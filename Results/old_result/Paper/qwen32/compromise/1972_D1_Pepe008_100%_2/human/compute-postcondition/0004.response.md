The code snippet `suma = 0` initializes the variable `suma` to 0. The other variables (`t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, `b`) are not affected by this statement.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` must be greater than 0, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`, `suma` is 0.**
