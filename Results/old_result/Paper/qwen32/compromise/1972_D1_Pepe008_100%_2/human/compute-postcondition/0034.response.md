The code snippet `suma += x` increments the variable `suma` by the value of `x`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged as per the given initial state. Therefore, the updated value of `suma` will be the previous value of `suma` plus `x`.

Output State: **`suma` is the previous value of `suma` plus `x`, `t` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `T`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and `b` must be at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`**.
