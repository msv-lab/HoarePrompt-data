The code increments `suma` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`suma` is `suma + x + 1`, `t` is 3, `T` is greater than 3, `info` is a list of strings based on the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and `b` is at least 1, `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, and it holds that `((a - i * (i - 1)) % i`**
