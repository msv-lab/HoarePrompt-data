Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is `a + 1`, and the condition ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0) holds true.**
