The code snippet calculates the value of `x` based on the current values of `a` and `i`. Given that `i` is `i + 1` from the initial state, we need to incorporate this into the calculation.

The formula for `x` is:
\[ x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1 \]

Since `i` is `i + 1`, we need to use this updated value of `i` in the formula. Let's denote the updated value of `i` as `i_new`.

The output state will reflect the new value of `x` calculated using the formula, while `b` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `b` remains unchanged, `x` is calculated as \(\left(\frac{a - (i + 1) \cdot ((i + 1) - 1)}{(i + 1)^2}\right) + 1\)**

In natural language: The value of `i` is now `i + 1`, `b` remains the same, and `x` is calculated using the formula \(\left(\frac{a - (i + 1) \cdot i}{(i + 1)^2}\right) + 1\).
