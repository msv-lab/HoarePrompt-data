The value of `suma` is reassigned to 0, but the values of `t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`suma` is 0, `t` is 3, `T` is greater than `t`, `info` is a list of strings based on the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and `b` is at least 1.**
