The code `info = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `info`. The values of `t` and `T` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` must be greater than 0, `info` is a list of strings from the input.**
