Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum score as described in the problem statement. The logic for determining the maximum number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]` is flawed.

Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `ans`**:
   - The program incorrectly calculates `ans` when `k < n * m`. The approach used does not correctly distribute the remaining `k` cards to maximize the number of permutations.
   - The line `a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` and subsequent logic for calculating `ans` does not ensure that `ans` is the product of the counts of each card type in an optimal arrangement.

2. **Handling of `k >= n * m`**:
   - When `k >= n * m`, the program sets `ans` to `math.factorial(n)`, which is incorrect. The correct approach is to determine how many full permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]` can be formed with the available cards and the additional `k` cards.

3. **General Approach**:
   - The program needs to determine the minimum number of each card type required to form a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]` and then distribute the additional `k` cards to maximize the number of such permutations.

A correct approach would involve:
- Calculating the minimum number of each card type needed to form a permutation.
- Distributing the additional `k` cards to minimize the difference between the counts of card types, thereby maximizing the number of permutations.
- Calculating the number of permutations based on the final counts of card types.

Here is a sketch of a correct approach:

```python
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        m = min(a)
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of each card type needed
        min_needed = n * m
        remaining_k = k - (min_needed - sum(a))
        
        # Distribute remaining_k to minimize the differences
        for i in range(n):
            a[i] += min(remaining_k, n - a[i] + m)
            remaining_k -= min(remaining_k, n - a[i] + m)
        
        # Calculate the number of permutations
        ans = math.factorial(n)
        for count in a:
            ans //= math.factorial(count - m)
        
        print(ans)

func()
```

This sketch needs further refinement to handle edge cases and ensure correctness, but it provides a better approach than the original program.
