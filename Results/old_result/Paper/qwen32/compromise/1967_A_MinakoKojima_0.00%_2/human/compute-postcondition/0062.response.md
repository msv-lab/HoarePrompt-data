The code snippet `k -= n * m` subtracts the product of `n` and `m` from `k`. Therefore, the value of `k` will be updated to `k - n * m`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the new input split into two parts, where `k` is now `k - n * m`; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`. If `k >= n * m`, then `ans` is set to `math.factorial(n)`. Otherwise, `ans` is the product of the differences `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, ..., `a[n-1] - a[n-2]`, and `i` is set to `n`. `ans` is 0.**
