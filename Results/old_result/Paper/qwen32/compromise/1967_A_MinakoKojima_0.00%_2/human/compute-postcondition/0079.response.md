The code snippet `ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]` modifies the value of `ans` by multiplying it with the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. Given the initial state, we know that `i` is 2, so this operation will use `a[2]` and `a[1]`.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `k` is now `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`.
- `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` is `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.
- `m` is the minimum value in the adjusted list `a`.
- `ans` is `a[0] * (a[n-1] - a[n-2]) * (a[1] - a[0])`.
- `i` is 2.

After executing the code snippet, `ans` is updated to `ans * (a[2] - a[1])`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is now `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` is `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`, `m` is the minimum value in the adjusted list `a`, `ans` is `a[0] * (a[n-1] - a[n-2]) * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1])`, `i` is 2.**
