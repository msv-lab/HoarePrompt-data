The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.
- `k` is reduced by `min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.
- `i` has been incremented by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`, `k` is reduced by `min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since we are only concerned with adjusting the state of objects in the loop head, we only need to adjust `i`:

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
