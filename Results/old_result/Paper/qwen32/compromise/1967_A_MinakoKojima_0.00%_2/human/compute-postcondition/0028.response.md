To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and the logic that determines the value of `ans`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer between 1 and 100. This variable is not directly used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this specific `print` statement.
2. **`n` and `k`**: These are integers obtained from the input. They are used in the condition to determine the value of `ans`.
3. **`a`**: A list of integers obtained from the input. The list `a` could potentially be updated in the else part of the condition.
4. **`m`**: The minimum value in the list `a`.
5. **`ans`**: This variable is set based on the condition `k >= n * m`.
   - If `k >= n * m`, then `ans` is set to `math.factorial(n)`.
   - Otherwise, `ans` is calculated based on the loop and the cumulative differences in the list `a`.

### Determining the Value of `ans`:
- **Condition Check (`k >= n * m`)**:
  - If this condition is true, `ans` is simply the factorial of `n` (`math.factorial(n)`).
  - If this condition is false, `ans` is calculated using a more complex process involving the list `a` and cumulative differences.

### Output Based on the Condition:
Given the information, we can describe the output in two possible scenarios:

1. **If `k >= n * m`**:
   - `ans` is `math.factorial(n)`.
   - The output will be the factorial of `n`.

2. **If `k < n * m`**:
   - `ans` is calculated as the first element of `a` multiplied by the cumulative differences up to `a[n-1] - a[n-2]`.
   - The exact value of `ans` depends on the specific values in the list `a` and the number of elements `n`.

Since we do not have the exact values of `n`, `k`, and the list `a`, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `ans`. However, we can provide a precise description of what `ans` will be based on the given conditions.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is math.factorial(n) if k >= n * m, otherwise ans is the first element of a multiplied by the cumulative differences up to a[n-1] - a[n-2])**
