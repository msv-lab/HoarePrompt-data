The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.

Therefore, to adjust the state for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value of `i + 1`, making it `i + 2`. The condition `n` must be greater than `i + 1` should now be `n` must be greater than `i + 2`.

The other variables (`a[i]`, `k`, `m`, `n`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 2`; `i` is `i + 2`**
