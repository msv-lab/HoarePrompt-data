The given code snippet modifies the variable `ans` by multiplying it with the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 3, this means `ans` will be multiplied by `a[3] - a[2]`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `ans` is multiplied by `a[1] - a[0]`, then by `a[2] - a[1]`, and finally by `a[3] - a[2]`.**

In natural language: The value of `i` remains 3, `n` must still be greater than 3, and `ans` has been updated by being multiplied with the difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]` in addition to the previous multiplications.
