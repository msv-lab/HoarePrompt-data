The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 5, and `n` must be greater than 5.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than 5; `k` is 0; `a` is a list of integers updated according to the loop; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is the first element of the list `a` multiplied by the cumulative differences up to `a[4] - a[3]`; `i` is 5**
