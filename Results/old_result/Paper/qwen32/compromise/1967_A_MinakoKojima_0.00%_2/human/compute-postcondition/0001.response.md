The code snippet assigns the values of `n` and `k` by splitting the input into two integers. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input split into two parts.**
