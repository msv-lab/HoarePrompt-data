In the provided for loop, the loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable that can be adjusted in the loop head is the value obtained from `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

Given the state before the loop starts, we have:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100 (which likely corresponds to the number of test cases).
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` is such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^12.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^5.

However, the loop only depends on the value of `t` (the number of test cases) because the loop iterates `t` times.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. Given that the problem states `1 <= t <= 100`, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes at least once. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`) are not directly relevant to the loop's execution count and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to run.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts is already sufficient for the loop to execute as long as `t` is within the specified range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100**
