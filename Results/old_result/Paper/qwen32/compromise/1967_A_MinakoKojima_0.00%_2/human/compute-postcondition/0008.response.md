The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `n * m` from it. Given the initial conditions, `t` remains unchanged, and `n`, `m`, and `a` also remain unchanged. The only change is in the value of `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input split into two parts, with `k` now being `k - n * m`; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is 0; `k` is less than `n * m`.**
