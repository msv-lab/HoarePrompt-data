### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the number of facing-up coins ('U') in the initial configuration. The key insight is that if the number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice will always win if both players play optimally. If the number of 'U' coins is even, Bob will win under optimal play.

The provided program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of coins and the string representing the coins' states. It checks if the count of 'U' in the string is odd or even and appends 'yes' or 'no' to the results list accordingly. Finally, it prints the results.

The logic in the program correctly implements this insight by checking the parity of the count of 'U'. If the count is odd, Alice wins ('yes'), and if it's even, Bob wins ('no').
