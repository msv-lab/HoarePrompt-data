In the given for loop, the loop iterates directly over the elements of the `results` list. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the `results` list itself to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, the `results` list must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`results` is a list of length `t` containing 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in each string `s` is odd or even respectively, and `t` must be greater than 0**.
