Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that need to be addressed to correctly solve the problem:

1. **Handling Quaffle**: The program does not correctly handle the Quaffle's position. It should be updated when a player catches or throws it, and it should be reset to the middle of the field after a goal is scored. The current code does not track the Quaffle's position at all.

2. **Goal Scoring Logic**: The program checks if a player is in a goal position to determine a score, but it does not check if the player is carrying the Quaffle. Only a player carrying the Quaffle can score a goal.

3. **Incorrect Goal Detection**: The program checks if a player is in a goal position using `if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:` and `if players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:`. This will not work because `players[mo[0]]` is a tuple representing the player's position, and `goals['R']` and `goals['B']` are lists of tuples representing goal positions. The correct check should be if the player's position matches any of the goal positions.

4. **Incorrect Movement Handling**: The function `func_1` should be called to update the position of the Quaffle when a player catches or throws it.

5. **Printing Scores**: The program should print the score correctly when a goal is scored, but it does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal.

6. **Final Score**: The final score is printed with the scores reversed. The correct format should be `FINAL SCORE: r b`, where `r` is the score of the red team and `b` is the score of the blue team.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
quaffle = None

for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quaffle = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)

moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
        if mo[0] == quaffle:
            quaffle = players[mo[0]]
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        if players[mo[0]] == quaffle:
            quaffle = mo[0]
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        if quaffle == mo[0]:
            if any(players[mo[0]] == goal for goal in goals['R']):
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            elif any(players[mo[0]] == goal for goal in goals['B']):
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            else:
                if mo[0][0] == 'R':
                    pointsb += 1
                    print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
                else:
                    pointsr += 1
                    print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            quaffle = ((m + 1) // 2 - 1, (n + 1) // 2 - 1)

print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)

def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned above and should work correctly for the problem.
