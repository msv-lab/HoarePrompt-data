Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The problem involves a one-dimensional grid where each cell contains either '<' or '>'. A pinball placed on a cell moves according to the direction indicated by the character in that cell. After moving, the character in the cell is inverted. The task is to determine how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid when placed on each cell.

### Program Analysis
The program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. Let's break down each function:

#### Function `func_1(arr, times)`
- **Purpose**: To compute a value based on the accumulated sums in `arr` and the number of times specified.
- **Logic**: It calculates the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at a specific index determined by `times`. The index is calculated as `max(-n, -1 - times)`, which seems to be an attempt to handle negative indexing and boundary conditions.

#### Function `func_2(s1, n)`
- **Purpose**: To compute the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each cell when placed on that cell.
- **Logic**:
  - It first identifies the indices of all cells containing '>' and stores them in `pre`, along with their cumulative sum in `preOne`.
  - It maintains a list `suffZero` to keep track of cumulative sums related to cells containing '<'.
  - For each cell, it checks whether the character is '>' or '<' and computes the number of seconds using a combination of the cumulative sums and the logic in `func_1`.
  - Depending on the counts of '>' and '<' cells, it calculates the number of seconds the pinball takes to leave the grid.
  - The results are stored in the `ans` list and printed.

### Correctness Analysis
The program attempts to efficiently compute the number of seconds for each cell using cumulative sums and precomputed values. However, there are several issues that make the program incorrect:

1. **Indexing and Boundary Conditions**: The logic for handling indices in `func_1` (especially `max(-n, -1 - times)`) is not clearly defined and may lead to incorrect results for certain cases.
2. **Cumulative Sum Handling**: The way cumulative sums are used and updated in `func_2` may not correctly reflect the actual movement and inversion rules of the pinball.
3. **Inversion Logic**: The program does not correctly simulate the inversion of characters after each move, which is crucial for determining the correct path and time taken by the pinball.

### Conclusion
Given the complexity and the specific logic used in the program, it is highly unlikely that the program correctly simulates the pinball movement and inversion rules for all possible test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
