### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the minimum number of screens required to place a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons on a 5x3 grid (15 cells in total).

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the logic in the program:

1. **Calculate Space Requirements:**
   - `space_x = x * 1`: This calculates the total space required for the 1x1 icons.
   - `space_y = y * 4`: This calculates the total space required for the 2x2 icons.

2. **Determine Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - Each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells. If `y` is even, `y // 2` screens are required. If `y` is odd, `y // 2 + 1` screens are required.
   - This is because each screen can hold up to 2 non-overlapping 2x2 icons (8 cells) or 1 2x2 icon (4 cells) plus some 1x1 icons.

3. **Calculate Remaining Space:**
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`: This calculates the remaining cells on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
   
4. **Check if Remaining Space is Enough for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If `space_x` (the space required for 1x1 icons) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells` (the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons), then no additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons.
   - If `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, then we need to calculate how many additional screens are required for the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`: This is the space still needed after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - If `extra_space` is a multiple of 15, then `extra_space // 15` additional screens are required.
   - If `extra_space` is not a multiple of 15, then `extra_space // 15 + 1` additional screens are required.

5. **Output the Result:**
   - The total screens required are the sum of the screens needed for the 2x2 icons and the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.

### Verification with Example Cases:

Let's verify the program with a few example cases:

- **Test Case 1 (1 1):**
  - `space_x = 1`, `space_y = 4`
  - `screen_require_for_y = 1`
  - `remaining_cells = 15 - 4 = 11`
  - Since `space_x (1) <= remaining_cells (11)`, only 1 screen is required.
  - **Output:** 1

- **Test Case 3 (12 4):**
  - `space_x = 12`, `space_y = 16`
  - `screen_require_for_y = 2`
  - `remaining_cells = 30 - 16 = 14`
  - Since `space_x (12) <= remaining_cells (14)`, only 2 screens are required.
  - **Output:** 2

- **Test Case 11 (0 9):**
  - `space_x = 0`, `space_y = 36`
  - `screen_require_for_y = 5`
  - `remaining_cells = 75 - 36 = 39`
  - Since `space_x (0) <= remaining_cells (39)`, only 5 screens are required.
  - **Output:** 5

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens for each test case based on the provided logic and the given examples. Therefore, the program appears to be correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
