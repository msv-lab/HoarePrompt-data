### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the described operations. The program only checks if the first and last rows and the first and last columns are uniform and different from each other, which is not a sufficient condition to determine if the entire grid can be made uniform.

Let's break down the problem and the program logic:

1. **Problem Analysis:**
   - We can select any two squares of the same color and color all squares in the subrectangle between them that color.
   - We need to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color after performing any number of operations.

2. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads the grid and constructs `first_row` and `last_row` by taking the first and last characters of each row, respectively.
   - It then checks if the first row and the last row are uniform and different from each other, or if the first column and the last column are uniform and different from each other.
   - If either condition is true, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

3. **Flaw in the Program:**
   - The program only checks the first and last rows and columns, which is not sufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made uniform.
   - There are cases where the first and last rows and columns are uniform and the same, but the grid still cannot be made uniform. For example:
     ```
     2 2
     WB
     BW
     ```
     Here, the first and last rows and columns are not uniform and different, but it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform.

4. **Counterexamples:**
   - As mentioned in the original assessment, the grid:
     ```
     2 2
     WB
     BW
     ```
     should output "NO", but the program outputs "YES".
   - Another example:
     ```
     3 3
     WBW
     BWB
     WBW
     ```
     should also output "NO", but the program outputs "YES".

### Conclusion:

The program's logic is flawed because it does not consider the entire grid but only checks the first and last rows and columns. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
