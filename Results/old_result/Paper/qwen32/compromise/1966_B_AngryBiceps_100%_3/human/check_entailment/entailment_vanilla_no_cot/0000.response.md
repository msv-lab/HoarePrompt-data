Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the described operations. 

The main flaw is in the logic used to decide when it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color. Specifically, it only checks if the first and last rows, and the first and last columns, are uniform and different from each other. However, this is not sufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made uniform.

For example, consider a grid where the first row and the last row are uniform but not the same, and the middle rows are uniform but match the first row. In this case, the program would incorrectly output "NO", even though it might be possible to make the entire grid uniform through a series of operations.

Here's a counterexample:
```
3 3
WWW
BBB
WWW
```
The program would output "NO" because the first and last rows are uniform but different. However, it is possible to make the entire grid uniform by selecting (1, 1) and (3, 1) and then (1, 3) and (3, 3).

To correctly solve the problem, the program should check if there is a single color that appears in every row and every column. If there is such a color, then it is possible to make the entire grid that color using the given operations. Otherwise, it is not possible.
