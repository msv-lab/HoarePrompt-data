The code snippet assigns an empty string to the variable `first_row`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a` is an empty list; `first_row` is an empty string.**
