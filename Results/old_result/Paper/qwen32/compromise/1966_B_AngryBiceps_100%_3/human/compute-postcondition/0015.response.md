The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last string in the list `a` to `first_row`. Given the initial state, `first_row` is already the original `first_row` concatenated with the first character of the second string in `a`. After executing the code, `first_row` will be further extended by the first character of the third string in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list containing three string elements (the original user input, the new user input, and the newly appended input); `first_row` is the original `first_row` concatenated with the first character of the second string in `a` and then with the first character of the third string in `a`; `last_row` is the last character of the second string in `a` repeated twice; `i` is `i + 1`.**
