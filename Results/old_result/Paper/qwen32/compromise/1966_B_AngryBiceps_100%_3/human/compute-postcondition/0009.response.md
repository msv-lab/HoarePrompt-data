The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value such that it has completed an iteration, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can assume that `i` has just completed an iteration and is about to be incremented. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list containing one string element (the user input); `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`; `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a`; `i` is incremented by 1**
