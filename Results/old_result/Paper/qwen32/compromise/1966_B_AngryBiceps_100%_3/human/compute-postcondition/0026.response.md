Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list containing `n` string elements (all user inputs); `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each string in `a`; `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each string in `a`. If the first string in `a` consists of the same character repeated, the last string in `a` consists of a different character repeated, and the first and last strings in `a` are not identical, then the conditions of the if part are met. Otherwise, it is not the case that the first string in `a` consists of the same character repeated and the last string in `a` consists of the same character repeated, or the first and last strings in `a` are the same. If `first_row` consists of the same character repeated and `last_row` consists of the same character repeated, and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`, then the conditions of the if part are met. Otherwise, the conditions of the else part are met.**
