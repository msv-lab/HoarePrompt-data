Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a` is an empty list; `first_row` is an empty string; `last_row` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a.append(input())
    first_row += a[-1][0]
    last_row += a[-1][-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list containing one string element (the user input); `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`; `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list containing two string elements (the original user input and the new user input); `first_row` is the original `first_row` concatenated with the first character of the second string in `a`; `last_row` is the last character of the second string in `a` repeated twice; `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list containing three string elements (the original user input, the new user input, and the newly appended input); `first_row` is the original `first_row` concatenated with the first character of the second string in `a` and then with the first character of the third string in `a`; `last_row` is the last character of the second string in `a` repeated twice followed by the last character of the third string in `a`; `i` is `i + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
