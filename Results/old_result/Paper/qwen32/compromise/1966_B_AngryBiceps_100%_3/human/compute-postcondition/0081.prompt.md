Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 500. The grid is represented by n lines, each containing m characters, where each character is either 'W' or 'B'. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = []
    first_row = ''
    last_row = ''
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(input())
        first_row += a[-1][0]
        last_row += a[-1][-1]
    if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
        print('NO')
    elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)
        ) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list containing `n` string elements (all user inputs); `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each string in `a`; `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each string in `a`. If the first string in `a` consists of the same character repeated, the last string in `a` consists of a different character repeated, and the first and last strings in `a` are not identical, then the conditions of the if part are met. Otherwise, it is not the case that the first string in `a` consists of the same character repeated and the last string in `a` consists of the same character repeated, or the first and last strings in `a` are the same. If `first_row` consists of the same character repeated and `last_row` consists of the same character repeated, and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`, then the conditions of the if part are met. Otherwise, the conditions of the else part are met.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements which are the input strings, `first_row` is a string composed of the first characters of each of the `n` input strings, `last_row` is a string composed of the last characters of each of the `n` input strings, `i` is `n - 1`. If the first string in `a` consists of identical characters, the last string in `a` also consists of identical characters, and these two strings are not equal to each other, then the conditions remain as specified. Otherwise, either the set of characters in the first string `a[0]` does not have a length of 1, or the set of characters in the last string `a[-1]` does not have a length of 1, or the first string `a[0]` is equal to the last string `a[-1]`. Additionally, if the set of characters in `first_row` has a length of 1, the set of characters in `last_row` has a length of 1, and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`, then the conditions remain as specified in the if part. Otherwise, at least one of the following is true: the set of characters in `first_row` does not have a length of 1, the set of characters in `last_row` does not have a length of 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings, `first_row` is a string consisting of the first characters of each string in `a` concatenated together, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last characters of each string in `a` concatenated together, `i` is `n-1`. If the first string in `a` consists of identical characters, the last string in `a` consists of identical characters, and the first string in `a` is not the same as the last string in `a`, then the condition in the if part holds. Otherwise, either the set of characters in `a[0]` does not contain a single unique character, or the set of characters in `a[-1]` does not contain a single unique character, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`. Additionally, if the set of characters in `first_row` contains a single unique character, the set of characters in `last_row` contains a single unique character, and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`, then the condition in the if part holds. Otherwise, either the set of characters in `first_row` does not contain a single unique character, or the set of characters in `last_row` does not contain a single unique character, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
