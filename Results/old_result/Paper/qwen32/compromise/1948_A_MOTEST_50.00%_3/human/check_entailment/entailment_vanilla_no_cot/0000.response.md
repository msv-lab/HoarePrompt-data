Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect based on the problem description:

1. **Handling the case when `n == 1`:**
   - The program correctly prints `NO` for `n == 1` because it's impossible to have a single special character in a string of uppercase Latin letters where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

2. **Handling even `n`:**
   - For even `n`, the program generates a string by repeating pairs of different uppercase letters. For example, for `n = 6`, it generates `AAABAACC`. This is correct because it has exactly 6 special characters, as required.

3. **Handling odd `n`:**
   - The program starts with the string `'AAA'` for odd `n` and then continues by adding pairs of different uppercase letters. However, this approach does not always generate a string with exactly `n` special characters.
   - For `n = 1`, it correctly prints `NO`.
   - For `n = 3`, the program generates `'AAABB'`, which has 3 special characters, so this is correct.
   - For `n = 5`, the program generates `'AAABBB'`, which has 4 special characters, not 5, so this is incorrect.
   - For `n = 7`, the program generates `'AAABBBC'`, which has 5 special characters, not 7, so this is incorrect.

To fix the program, we need to ensure that for odd `n`, we generate a string with exactly `n` special characters. One way to do this is to start with a string of the form `AAB` (which has 2 special characters) and then add pairs of different uppercase letters until we reach the desired number of special characters.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import string
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = 'AAB' if n % 2 == 1 else ''
            x = 1
            while len(ans) < n + 1:
                ans += s[x] * 2
                x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans[:n+1])

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that for odd `n`, the string starts with `AAB` and then adds pairs of different uppercase letters until the string has exactly `n` special characters.
