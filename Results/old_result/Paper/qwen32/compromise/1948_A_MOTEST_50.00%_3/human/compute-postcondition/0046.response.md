The code `ans += s[x] * 2` takes the character at index `x` from the string `s` and appends it twice to `ans`. Given the initial state, `x` is 1, so `s[x]` is "B". Therefore, "BB" is appended to `ans`, which was initially "AA". The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `s` is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"; `i` is incremented by 1; `ans` is "AABB"; `x` is 1; `j` is 1**.
