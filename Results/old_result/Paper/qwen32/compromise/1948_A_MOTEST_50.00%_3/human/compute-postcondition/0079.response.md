The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n // 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is at least 4, so `n // 2` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be at least 4.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be at least 4, `s` is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", `i` is 2, `ans` is "AABB", `x` is 2, `j` is 2**
