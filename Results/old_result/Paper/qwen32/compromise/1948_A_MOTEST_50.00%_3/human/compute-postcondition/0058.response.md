The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends two characters from the string `s` to `ans`. Since `x` is 2, `s[x]` is the character at index 2 of `s`, which is "C". Therefore, `s[x] * 2` results in "CC". This is appended to `ans`, which initially is `'AAABB'`. Thus, `ans` becomes `'AAABBCC'`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `i`, `x`, `j`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer such that `n` is not divisible by 2 and `n` is at least 5; `s` is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"; `i` is incremented by 1; `ans` is `'AAABBCC'`; `x` is 2; `j` is 1**.
