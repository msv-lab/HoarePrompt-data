Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `s` is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"; `i` is incremented by 1; `ans` is "AA"; `x` is 0**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` of the string `s` repeated twice to the `ans` string. Since `x` is 0, `s[x]` is "A". Therefore, "AA" is added to `ans`, making `ans` equal to "AA". The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `x` remain unchanged, and `i` is still incremented by 1, but since the increment operation is not shown in the code snippet, we only reflect the changes made by the given code.
