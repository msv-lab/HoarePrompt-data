Reasoning: 

The provided program aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum length of a tandem repeat substring after replacing question marks in the input string with lowercase Latin letters. The function `func_1()` is supposed to handle each test case individually.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic in `func_1()`:
1. The function reads a string `s` and converts it to a list of characters.
2. It iterates over possible lengths of the tandem repeat (from half the length of the string down to 1).
3. For each length `j`, it checks all possible starting positions `k` in the string to see if a tandem repeat of length `2*j` can be formed.
4. It uses a `count` variable to keep track of consecutive positions where either a character matches or one of the positions is a question mark.
5. If `count` reaches `j`, it means a tandem repeat of length `2*j` can be formed, and the function prints `2*j` and returns.
6. If no such tandem repeat is found after checking all possible lengths, the function prints `0`.

The logic seems correct in that it checks for possible tandem repeats by allowing question marks to act as wildcards. The function correctly handles the requirement to find the maximum possible length of a tandem repeat substring.

However, there is a crucial aspect that the code does not address: the replacement of question marks to maximize the length of the tandem repeat. The current implementation does not actually replace the question marks but assumes that they can be replaced to form a tandem repeat if possible. This is a valid assumption given the problem's requirements, as the goal is to determine the maximum possible length, not to generate the actual string.

Given that the function correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible length of a tandem repeat substring, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
