The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range of `k`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than `n - j`.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `n - 3`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` should be `n - 2`.

The values of `j`, `n`, and the conditions related to `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`j` is 1, `n` is at least 4, `k` is `n - 2`**
