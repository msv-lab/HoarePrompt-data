To determine what will be printed by the `print(count * 2)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the logic involved:

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This variable seems to represent a number of test cases or iterations but is not directly involved in the `print` statement.
   - `s`: A list of characters with length `n` (where \(n \geq 2\)).
   - `j`: An integer less than `n`.
   - `k`: An integer that is incremented by 1 in the loop, and `k + 1` must be less than `n - j`.
   - `count`: This variable is incremented by 1 if any of the following conditions are met:
     - `s[k] == '?'`
     - `s[k + j] == '?'`
     - `s[k] == s[k + j]`
   - Otherwise, `count` is set to 0.

2. **Logic:**
   - We have a loop that iterates through the list `s` with the variable `k` starting from a certain point and ending at a point where `k + 1 < n - j`.
   - For each iteration, the conditions are checked, and `count` is updated accordingly.
   - The final value of `count` is then multiplied by 2 and printed.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - The exact value of `count` depends on the contents of the list `s`, the value of `j`, and how the loop iterates.
   - Without specific values for `s` and `j`, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `count`.
   - However, we can describe the output in terms of the final value of `count` after the loop completes.

Given this analysis, the output of the `print(count * 2)` statement will be:

Output: **count * 2 (where count is the final value of count after the loop completes based on the conditions specified)**
