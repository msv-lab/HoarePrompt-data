Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

- **Initial State:**
  - `j` is 1.
  - `n` is at least 4.
  - `k` is `n - 3`.
  - `count` is 1.
  - `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`.

- **Code Snippet:**
  ```python
  print(count * 2)
  ```

- **Analysis:**
  - The value of `count` is explicitly given as 1.
  - The expression `count * 2` will simply multiply the value of `count` by 2.
  - Therefore, `count * 2` evaluates to `1 * 2`, which is `2`.

- **Explanation:**
  - The `print` statement outputs the result of the expression `count * 2`.
  - Since `count` is 1, the expression evaluates to 2.

- **Output:**
  Output: **2**
