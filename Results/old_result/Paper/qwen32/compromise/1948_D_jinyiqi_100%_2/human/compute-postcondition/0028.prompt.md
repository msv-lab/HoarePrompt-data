Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `s` is a list of characters with `n` (length of `s`) being at least 2, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark; `count` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(0, n - j):
    if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
        count += 1
    else:
        count = 0
    if count == j:
        print(count * 2)
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters with `n` (length of `s`) being at least 2, `j` must be less than `n`. If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` equals `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` is 0, `s[k]` is not equal to '?', `s[k + j]` is not equal to '?', and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`. Additionally, `count` is not equal to `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters with `n` (length of `s`) being at least 2, `j` must be less than `n`, `k` is `k + 1` and `k + 1` must be less than `n - j`. If `count` was incremented by 1 (because `s[k] == '?'` or `s[k + j] == '?'` or `s[k] == s[k + j]`), then `count` is either equal to `j` or less than `j`. If `count` was set to 0, then `count` is 0. The program does not return anything.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters with `n` (length of `s`) being at least 2, `j` must be less than `n`, `k` is `k + 1`. If `s[k] == '?'` or `s[k + j] == '?'` or `s[k] == s[k + j]`, then `count` is either equal to `j + 1` or less than `j + 1` if it was incremented by 1, or `count` is 1 if it was set to 0. Otherwise, `count` is 0. The program returns nothing (None) if `count` is equal to `j`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
