The code calculates the integer square root of `n`, adds 1 to it, and assigns the result to `root`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6; `ans` is equal to `n`; `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.**
