Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
- `ans` is calculated as `n` plus the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all `i` from `2` to `root`.
- `root` is defined as `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
`ans` is calculated as:
\[ \text{ans} = n + \sum_{i=2}^{\text{root}} \left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i \cdot i} \right\rfloor \]

Where:
- `root` is the integer part of the square root of `n` plus one.

### Explanation:
The variable `ans` is computed by:
1. Starting with the value of `n`.
2. Adding the integer division of \((n + i)\) by \((i \cdot i)\) for each `i` from 2 up to `root`.

The exact value of `ans` depends on the specific values of `n` and `m`, but since `m` is not used in the calculation of `ans`, we can ignore it for this part.

### Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` as calculated above.

Given the information, the precise description of the output is:

Output: **ans (where ans is n plus the sum of (n + i) // (i * i) for all i from 2 to root, and root is int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1)**
