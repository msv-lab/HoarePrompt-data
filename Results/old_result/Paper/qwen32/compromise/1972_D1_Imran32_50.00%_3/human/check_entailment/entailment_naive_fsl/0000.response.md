Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the given problem. The problem asks for the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). However, the provided code does not follow this logic.

The function `func_1` in the code seems to be calculating something related to divisors and sums, but it does not correctly implement the required condition. Specifically, the code does not iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) and check if a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

Here is a counterexample to show that the code is incorrect:

Input:
```
1
3 3
```

Expected Output:
```
4
```

Explanation of the expected output:
- (1, 1): gcd(1, 1) = 1, 1 + 1 = 2, 2 is a multiple of 1 * 1.
- (2, 1): gcd(2, 1) = 1, 2 + 1 = 3, 3 is a multiple of 1 * 1.
- (3, 1): gcd(3, 1) = 1, 3 + 1 = 4, 4 is a multiple of 1 * 1.
- (3, 3): gcd(3, 3) = 3, 3 + 3 = 6, 6 is a multiple of 3 * 3.

However, the provided code will not produce the correct output for this input, as it does not correctly implement the logic to check all pairs (a, b).

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
