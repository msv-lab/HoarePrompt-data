You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of children, the number of pairs of friends, the number of excursions, and a list of friendships with their respective values.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description:

### Problem Description:
The task involves calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for excursions. The friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time it is chosen. The final expected value is expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers, and we need to output \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`: This function calculates the result for a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads multiple test cases and applies `func_1` to each test case.

Let's break down `func_1`:
- `result = 0`: Initializes the result to 0.
- `for i in range(m)`: Iterates over each friendship.
- `(a, b, f) = friendships[i]`: Unpacks the friendship details.
- `result += f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`: For each friendship, it adds the product of the initial friendship value `f` and the sum of the first `k` natural numbers to the result. The sum of the first `k` natural numbers is given by \(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\). This is then taken modulo `MOD`.
- `return result % MOD`: Returns the final result modulo `MOD`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**:
   - The provided code calculates the sum of friendship values for each pair over `k` excursions without considering the probability of each pair being chosen.
   - The expected value should account for the probability of each pair being chosen. Since the pairs are chosen equiprobably, the probability of any specific pair being chosen in one excursion is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - The expected value for a specific friendship pair over `k` excursions is not simply `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2)`. It should be weighted by the probability of being chosen.
   
2. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation is applied correctly in the code, but the logic for calculating the expected value is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values according to the problem description. The issue lies in the incorrect calculation of the expected value for each friendship pair.

### Incorrect Case Example:
Consider a test case with `n = 3`, `m = 1`, `k = 2`, and a friendship pair `(1, 2, 1)`. The correct expected value should take into account the probability of the pair `(1, 2)` being chosen, which is \(\frac{1}{3}\) (since there are 3 possible pairs: `(1, 2)`, `(1, 3)`, `(2, 3)`). The expected value for this pair over 2 excursions should be calculated as:
\[ \text{Expected Value} = 1 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{3} \cdot 1 + \frac{1}{3} \cdot 2 \right) = \frac{3}{3} = 1 \]
The provided code would incorrectly calculate it as:
\[ \text{Incorrect Calculation} = 1 \cdot \left( 2 \cdot 3 // 2 \right) = 3 \]

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.
