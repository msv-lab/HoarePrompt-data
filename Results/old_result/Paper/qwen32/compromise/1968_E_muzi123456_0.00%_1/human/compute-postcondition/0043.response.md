To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables `t`, `n`, and `i`.

1. **Initial State**: `t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 50, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3 for each of the `t` test cases.
2. **Loop Execution**: The loop decrements `t` by 1 in each iteration. For each value of `t`, it reads a new `n` and then runs an inner loop from `i = 1` to `i = n`, printing '1' followed by the value of `i` in each iteration. After the inner loop, it prints a space.

The loop continues until `t` becomes 0. Therefore, the final state of `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.

The value of `n` will be the last input value read from the user, and `i` will be `n + 1` after the last inner loop completes.

### Final Output State:
- `t` will be 0 because the loop runs until `t` becomes 0.
- `n` will be the last input value read from the user.
- `i` will be `n + 1` after the last inner loop completes.

Output State: **t is 0, n is the last input integer, i is n + 1.**

In natural language, this means that after all the test cases have been processed, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating no more test cases remain. The variable `n` will hold the value of the last test case's input, and the variable `i` will be one more than the last value it took in the inner loop of the last test case.
