The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates from 1 to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is such that 2 <= `i` <= `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, but it must still be less than or equal to `n`.

Given that `i` is currently in the range 2 to `n`, the next valid value for `i` should be `i + 1`, provided that `i + 1` does not exceed `n`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 49, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^3, `i` is an integer such that 3 <= `i` <= `n`**
