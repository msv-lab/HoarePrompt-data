In the given initial state, the variables `t` and `n` are defined with specific constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 49\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\)

However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state provided. Since `i` is not mentioned or initialized anywhere in the given information, it is not possible to determine its value based on the provided initial state. Therefore, the code snippet `print(i)` will result in a `NameError` because `i` is not defined.

Output: **NameError: name 'i' is not defined**
