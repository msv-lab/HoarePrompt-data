The code `t = int(input())` will read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50. After the execution of the code, `t` will hold the value of the integer input provided by the user, and this value will still satisfy the condition 1 <= t <= 50. The variable `n` and its properties are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 50, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3 for each of the `t` test cases.**
