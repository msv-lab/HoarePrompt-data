The value of `n` is reassigned to the integer value of the input provided. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the input operation. Since `t` must be greater than 0 and is now `t - 1`, and `i` is `n + 1`, these conditions still hold but with the new value of `n`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and is now `t - 1`; `n` is the integer value of the input; `i` is `n + 1`.**
