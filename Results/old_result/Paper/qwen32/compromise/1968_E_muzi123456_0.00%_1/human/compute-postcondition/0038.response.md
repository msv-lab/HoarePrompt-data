The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, and `t` is `t - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (since `i` is the loop variable that gets incremented automatically in each iteration), and `n` must be at least 2 (since `i` is currently 1 and needs to be less than `n + 1` for the loop to continue).

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2**
