The provided code snippet is a `print` statement with the string `'1'` and an `end` parameter set to a space `' '`. This means that when the `print` statement is executed, it will output the string `'1'` followed by a space, but it will not move to a new line after the space.

The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `i`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, and `i`.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

The output will be:
Output: **1 ** (where the output is the string `'1'` followed by a space)
