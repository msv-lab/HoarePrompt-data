To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`, where `n` is a given integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^3. For each iteration, the loop prints `1` followed by the current value of `i`.

After all iterations, `i` will have taken on every integer value from 1 to `n` inclusive. Since the loop runs `n` times, the final state of `i` will be `n + 1` (one past the last value it took during the loop).

The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged throughout the loop, as they are not modified in the loop body. Therefore, the final output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 49, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^3, `i` is an integer equal to `n + 1`**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the variable `t` will still be within the range from 0 to 49, the variable `n` will still be within the range from 2 to 1000, and the variable `i` will be equal to `n + 1`.
