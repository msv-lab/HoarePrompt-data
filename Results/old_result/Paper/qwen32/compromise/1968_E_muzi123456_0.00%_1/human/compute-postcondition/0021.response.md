The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The `for` loop iterates from `1` to `n` inclusive, meaning the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, which means the loop has just finished executing because `i` was incremented to a value greater than `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be reset to a value within the range `[1, n]`.

Given that `i` is `n + 1` at the end of the last iteration, we need to reset `i` to `1` to start the next iteration. The value of `n` does not need to be adjusted since it defines the range of the loop and is not modified within the loop head.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and is now `t - 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1**
