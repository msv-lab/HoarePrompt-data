Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state:

Initial State:
- `t` is `t - 1` (This expression doesn't define a value for `t`; it seems to imply that `t` is being decremented by 1, but `t` itself is not explicitly defined.)
- `n` must be at least 1 (This tells us that `n` is an integer and `n >= 1`.)
- `i` is `n + 1` (This tells us that `i` is an integer and `i = n + 1`.)

The Python code snippet is:
```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

The `print` statement in Python prints the specified message to the screen. In this case, the message is the string `'1'`. The `end=' '` argument specifies that after printing the string `'1'`, it should end with a space instead of the default newline character.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the variables `t`, `n`, or `i`, the values of these variables do not affect the output of this particular print statement.

Therefore, the output will simply be the string `'1'` followed by a space.

Output: **1 **
