Reasoning:
The provided program is designed to output `n` points for each test case, where each point is located in the first row of an `n x n` grid. Specifically, for a given `n`, the program outputs the points `(1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (1, n)`. 

However, the goal of the problem is to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. The provided solution does not achieve this goal because all points are located in the same row (the first row), resulting in only one possible Manhattan distance (the horizontal distance between points), which is not optimal.

To maximize the set \(\mathcal{H}\), the points should be distributed in such a way that they cover a wider range of Manhattan distances. For example, placing points at the corners and along the diagonals can help achieve this.

Given the execution summary, the program does not follow the optimal strategy to maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances, and thus does not solve the problem as intended.

Correctness: **False**
