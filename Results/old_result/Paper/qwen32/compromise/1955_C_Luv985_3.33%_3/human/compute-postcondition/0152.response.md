The code snippet `a[r] -= mi` subtracts the value of `mi` from `a[r]`. Given the initial state, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and `r` is `n - 1`. Therefore, `a[r]` is `a[n - 1]`, and after the operation, `a[n - 1]` will be `a[n - 1] - mi`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `l`, `ans`, `T`, and the other elements of `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `T` is 0, `a` is the list with updated integer values from the input where `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi` and `a[n - 1]` is `a[n - 1] - mi`, `mi` is `min(a[0] - mi, a[n - 1] - mi)`, and `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`.**
