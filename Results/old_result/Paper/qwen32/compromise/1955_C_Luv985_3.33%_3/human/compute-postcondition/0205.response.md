The task is to determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement given the initial state of the variables.

### Initial State:
- `n` is 5
- `k` is 0
- `l` is 2
- `r` is 3
- `ans` is 3
- `T` is 0
- `a` is [0, 0, 5, 6, 0]

From the initial state, we see that the variable `ans` is explicitly given a value of 3. The condition `if l equals r` is mentioned but it does not affect the value of `ans` in this case, as no changes are made to `ans` under that condition.

### Execution:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is 3.

### Output:
Output: **3**
