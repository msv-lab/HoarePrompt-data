Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0 or has been decreased by `mi * 2` in the if part, `l` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `a[0]` is 0, `r` is `n-1` or `n-2` depending on whether `a[r]` is 0, `a` is the list with updated integer values where `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` may have been decreased by `mi`, `mi` is recalculated as the minimum of the updated `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, and `ans` may have been incremented by 1 or 2 if `a[0]` or `a[r]` were 0 in the if part. If `mi * 2` was not less than or equal to `k`, `t` is `k % 2`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0.**
