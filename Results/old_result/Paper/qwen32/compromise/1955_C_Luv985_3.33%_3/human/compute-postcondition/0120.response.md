Output State: **`l` is 1 and `r` is at least 2, or `l` is 0 and `r` is at least 1, and `k` is greater than 0; `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, where `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`; `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`.**

Explanation: The value of `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, where `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. The values of `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the condition that `a[l]` is reduced by `mi` is also maintained.
