The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of the variable `r` by 1. Given the initial state, `r` is initially set to `n - 1`. After executing the code, `r` will be `n - 2`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **T is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; k is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15 and k is now k - mi * 2; a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, specifically a[0] is a[0] - mi and a[n-1] is a[n-1] - mi; l is 1 if a[0] was 0, otherwise l is 0; r is n - 2; ans is 2 if a[0] was 0, otherwise ans is 1; mi is min(a[0], a[n-1]) and mi * 2 <= k; the current value of a[l] is unchanged; a[r] is 0.**
