Postcondition: **`T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. If `mi * 2` (where `mi` is `min(a[0], a[n-1])`) is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is updated to `k - mi * 2`; `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - mi` and `a[n-1]` is updated to `a[n-1] - mi`; `l` is set to 1 if `a[0]` was 0, otherwise `l` remains 0; `r` is set to `n - 2` if `a[n-1]` was 0, otherwise `r` remains `n - 1`; `ans` is set to 2 if both `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` were 0, `ans` is set to 1 if only `a[0]` was 0, otherwise `ans` remains 0; `mi` is recalculated as `min(a[0], a[n-1])`. If `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, then `mi` is recalculated as `min(a[0], a[n-1])` and `mi * 2` is greater than `k`; `t` is set to `k % 2`; if `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0, then `ans` is set to 1, otherwise `ans` remains 0.**
