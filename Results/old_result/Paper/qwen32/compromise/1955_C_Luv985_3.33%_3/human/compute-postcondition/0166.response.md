Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `a` is the list with updated integer values from the input, `mi` is `min(a[0], a[n - 1])`, and `mi * 2` is greater than `k`. `t` is `k % 2`. If `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0, `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.**
