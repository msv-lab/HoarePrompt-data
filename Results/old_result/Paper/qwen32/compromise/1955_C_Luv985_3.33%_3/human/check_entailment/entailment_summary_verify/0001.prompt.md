You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers `a` and an integer `k`. For each test case, it calculates the maximum number of pairs of elements in `a` that can be reduced to zero by subtracting up to `k` from their sum, and prints the result.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the program and verify its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of ships) and `k` (the number of attacks).
   - It also reads the list of ship durabilities, `a`.

2. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - The program uses two pointers, `l` (left) and `r` (right), initialized to the start and end of the list respectively.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will count the number of sunk ships.

3. **Attacking Ships**:
   - The program enters a loop that continues as long as `l < r` and `k > 0`.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates the minimum durability between the ships at positions `l` and `r`, `mi`.
   - If `mi * 2` (the total damage that can be done in one round of attacks) is less than or equal to `k`, it means both ships can be attacked by `mi` durability points without exceeding the total attacks `k`.
     - It reduces the durability of both ships by `mi`.
     - It subtracts `mi * 2` from `k`.
     - If a ship's durability drops to 0, it increments `ans` and moves the corresponding pointer (`l` or `r`).
   - If `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, it means the Kraken can't fully attack both ships in the remaining attacks.
     - It calculates the remaining attacks, `t = k % 2`, and adjusts the durability of the ships accordingly.
     - It checks if the durability of either ship can be reduced to 0 with the remaining attacks and adjusts `ans` if necessary.
     - It breaks out of the loop as no more attacks can be made.

4. **Handling Single Ship**:
   - If `l == r` (only one ship left), it checks if the remaining attacks `k` are enough to sink the ship.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to the ship's durability, it increments `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing each test case, it prints the number of sunk ships, `ans`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the alternating attack pattern by the Kraken.
- It efficiently uses the two-pointer technique to manage the attacks on the ships.
- It correctly calculates the number of ships that can be sunk based on the given number of attacks.
- The edge cases, such as when there is only one ship or when the Kraken's attacks are insufficient to sink any ships, are handled correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description.

Correctness: **True**
