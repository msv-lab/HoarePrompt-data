Let's break down the initial state and the given Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - This tells us that `t` is within a specific range, but its exact value isn't specified.
   
2. `l1` is a list of strings.
   - We know `l1` contains strings, but we don't know how many or what they are.
   
3. `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1` and `n` equals 1.
   - This means the first element of `l1` must be the string "1", because `n` is explicitly stated to be 1.
   
4. `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
   - This means the second element of `l1` is a string representation of an integer, and `k` is the integer value of that string.

### Given Code Snippet:
```python
print(k)
```

### Analysis:
- Since `k` is defined as the integer value of the second element of `l1`, we need to know what the second element of `l1` is to determine the value of `k`.
- The initial state does not specify the exact content of `l1`, except for the first element being "1".
- Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `k` without knowing the second element of `l1`.

### Conclusion:
Based on the given information, we know that `k` is derived from the second element of `l1`, but the exact value of `k` cannot be determined because the second element of `l1` is not specified.

Thus, the output will be described in terms of `k` being the integer value of the second element of `l1`.

Output: **k (where k is the integer value of the second element of the list `l1`)**
