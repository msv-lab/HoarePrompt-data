The given code snippet only includes `l1 = input().split()`, which means that `l1` will be reassigned to a new list of strings obtained from the input, split by whitespace. This will overwrite the previous value of `l1`.

Since `n` and `k` are derived from the first and second elements of `l1` respectively, their values will also change based on the new input. However, the rest of the variables (`t`, `arr`, `ans`, `i`, `temp`, `k0`) will remain unchanged unless they are explicitly modified later in the code, which is not shown here.

Therefore, the Output State will reflect the new value of `l1` and the derived values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a new list of strings obtained from the input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`. If `n` equals 1, the program does not alter `t`, `l1`, `n`, or `k`. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list; `ans` is a list containing `n` elements, where the first two elements are `[(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1)]` and the remaining `n-2` elements are `0`; `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became greater than or equal to `k`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`; `k0` is equal to `k`. The input that controls the loop has decremented by 1.**
