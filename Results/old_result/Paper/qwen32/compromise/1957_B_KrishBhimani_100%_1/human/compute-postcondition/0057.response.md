The code snippet provided increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `ans` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `temp` is `2 * temp`; If `temp * 2 < k`, then `i` is 1, otherwise `i` is 0.

After executing `i += 1`, the value of `i` increases by 1. So, if `i` was initially 1, it becomes 2; if `i` was initially 0, it becomes 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `ans` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `temp` is `2 * temp`; `i` is increased by 1.**
