The given code snippet sets the variable `temp` to 1. No other variables are altered by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; if `n` equals 1, the program does not alter `t`, `l1`, `n`, or `k`; otherwise, `k0` remains equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `temp` is 1; `k0` is equal to `k`.**
