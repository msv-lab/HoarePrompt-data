The given code snippet modifies the value of `temp` by doubling it. The other variables remain unchanged unless they depend on `temp`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `l1` is a list of strings
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`
- `arr` is an empty list
- `k0` is equal to `k`
- `ans` is an empty list
- `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `temp * 2` is less than `k`
- `temp` is either `2 * temp` if `temp * 2` is less than `k`, otherwise `temp` remains 1

The code snippet `temp *= 2` doubles the value of `temp`. 

If initially `temp * 2` was less than `k`, then `temp` was already doubled to `2 * temp` before the code snippet was executed, and now it becomes `4 * temp` (initial value). If initially `temp * 2` was not less than `k`, then `temp` was set to 1, and now it becomes 2.

Therefore, the updated value of `temp` depends on its initial value relative to `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `temp * 2` is less than `k`; `temp` is either `4 * temp` (if initially `temp * 2` was less than `k`) or `2` (if initially `temp * 2` was not less than `k`).**
