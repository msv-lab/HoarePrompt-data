### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by reading an `n x n` grid of characters, where each character can be 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (no transition). The goal is to replace '?' with either 'F' or 'S' such that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type are seen in any permutation of the scenarios.

The program initializes two lists, `a` and `b`, to count the number of 'F' and 'S' characters for each scenario. It then reads the input grid and updates these counts accordingly.

The program then checks the counts of 'F' and 'S' for each scenario and categorizes scenarios into two lists, `sa` and `sb`, based on whether they have 'F' or 'S' transitions but not both.

The program then decides which list (`sa` or `sb`) to use based on their lengths. It appends scenarios with no transitions to either `sa` or `sb` as needed to ensure both lists have enough elements.

Finally, the program constructs the output grid by replacing '?' characters with 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions related to the elements in `sa` or `sb`.

However, there are several issues with the logic in the program:
1. The logic for deciding which list (`sa` or `sb`) to use is flawed. It does not take into account the requirement of ensuring that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type are seen.
2. The conditions for replacing '?' with 'F' or 'S' are not sufficient to guarantee the requirement of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.
3. The program does not consider all permutations of scenarios and their transitions, which is necessary to ensure the requirement is met for any order of scenarios.

Given these issues, the program does not guarantee the correct solution to the problem.

### Correctness: **False**
