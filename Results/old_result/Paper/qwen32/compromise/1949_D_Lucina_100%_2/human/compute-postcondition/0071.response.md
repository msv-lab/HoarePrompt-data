Postcondition: **`x` is the new input string, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `xx`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. If the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'F', then `a[i]` and `a[j]` are each increased by 1. If the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'S', then `b[i]` and `b[j]` are each incremented by 1. Otherwise, `b[i]` and `b[j]` remain unchanged.**
