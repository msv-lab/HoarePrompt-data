Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and an `n x n` grid of characters where each character is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', representing different types of transition videos or no transition. It processes the grid to replace '?' characters with either 'F' or 'S' based on the counts of 'F' and 'S' in each row and column, ensuring that the final grid has at most floor(n/2) 'F' or 'S' characters. The function then prints the modified grid.**
