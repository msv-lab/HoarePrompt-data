Postcondition: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` except `a[i]` which is 1 and `a[j]` which is 2 if the character at index `j - 1` in `x` is 'F'. Otherwise, `a` remains a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. `b` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` except `b[j]` which is 2 if `j` is the same as `i` or `b[j]` is 1 if `j` is different from `i` if the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'S'. If the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', `b` also remains a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, and `x` is the user's input string.**
