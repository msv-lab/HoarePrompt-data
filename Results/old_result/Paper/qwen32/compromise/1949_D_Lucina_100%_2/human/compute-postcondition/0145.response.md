Postcondition: **`sa` is the initial state, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3. If `xx[i][2]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is increased by the value of `xx[i][2]`. Otherwise, `nx` has 'F' appended to it if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`; otherwise, `nx` has 'S' appended to its initial value.**
