Postcondition: **`n` is 3, `a` is [1, 3, 4, 4], `b` is [1, 2, 3, 3], `xx` is ['', 'FSF', 'SSF', 'SFF'], `sa` is [], `sb` is [], `i` is 1, `j` is 3. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', then `nx` is 'F'. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?' and either `i` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, no changes occur. Otherwise, a NameError occurs because `nx` is not defined.**
