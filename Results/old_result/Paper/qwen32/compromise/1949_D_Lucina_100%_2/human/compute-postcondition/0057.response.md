Postcondition: **`n` is at least 3, `j` is 3. If `x[2]` is 'F', the element at index `i` in the list `a` is increased by 1, and the element at index 3 in the list `a` is increased by 1. If `x[2]` is 'S', then `b[i]` is incremented by 1 and `b[3]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `b[i]` or `b[3]`.**
