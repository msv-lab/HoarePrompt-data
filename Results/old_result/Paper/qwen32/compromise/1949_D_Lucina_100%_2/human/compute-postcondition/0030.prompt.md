Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `b` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, `x` is the user's input string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if x[j - 1] == 'F':
        a[i] += 1
        a[j] += 1
    elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
        b[i] += 1
        b[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` except `a[i]` which is 1 and `a[j]` which is 2 if the character at index `j - 1` in `x` is 'F'. Otherwise, `a` remains a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. `b` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` except `b[j]` which is 2 if `j` is the same as `i` or `b[j]` is 1 if `j` is different from `i` if the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'S'. If the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', `b` also remains a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, and `x` is the user's input string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` except `a[i]` which is 1 and `a[j]` which is 2 if the character at index `j - 1` in `x` is 'F', or `a[j]` which is 3 if the character at index `j - 1` in `x` is 'F' and the if condition is true. `b` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` except `b[j]` which is 2 if `j` is the same as `i` or `b[j]` is 1 if `j` is different from `i` if the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'S', or `b[j]` which is 3 if `j` is the same as `i` or `b[j]` is 2 if `j` is different from `i` if the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'S' and the if condition is false. If the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', `b[j]` is 1 if `j` is the same as `i` or `b[j]` remains 0 if `j` is different from `i`. If the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'S', `b[i]` is incremented by 1. `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, and `x` is the user's input string. `j` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` except `a[i]` which is either 2 or 1, and `a[j]` which is either 1, 2, 3, or 4 depending on the character at index `j` in `x`. `b` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` except `b[j + 1]` which is 2 if `j + 1` is the same as `i` or 1 if `j + 1` is different from `i` if the character at position `j` in `x` is 'S', or `b[j + 1]` which is 3 if `j + 1` is the same as `i` or 2 if `j + 1` is different from `i` if the character at position `j` in `x` is 'S' and the if condition is false. If the character at position `j` in `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', `b[j + 1]` is 1 if `j + 1` is the same as `i` or `b[j + 1]` remains 0 if `j + 1` is different from `i`. If `x[j - 1] == 'S'`, `b[i]` is incremented by 1. If `x[j - 1] == 'F'`, `a[j]` may be 3 or 4. If `x[j - 1] == 'F'` and the if condition is true, `a[j]` is 4. `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, `x` is the user's input string, and `j` is `j + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
