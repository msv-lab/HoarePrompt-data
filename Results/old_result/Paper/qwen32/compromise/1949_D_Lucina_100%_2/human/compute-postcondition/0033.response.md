Output State: **`n` is at least 1; `a` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` except `a[i]` which is incremented by the number of 'F' characters in `x` and `a[j]` which is incremented by 1 for each 'F' character at position `j - 1` in `x`; `b` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` except `b[i]` which is incremented by the number of 'S' characters in `x` and `b[j]` which is incremented by 1 for each 'S' character at position `j - 1` in `x`; `xx` is a list containing an empty string and the user's input string `x`; `x` is the new user's input string; `i` is `i + 1`**

In this state, `x` has been updated to the new user's input string, and `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous states and values.
