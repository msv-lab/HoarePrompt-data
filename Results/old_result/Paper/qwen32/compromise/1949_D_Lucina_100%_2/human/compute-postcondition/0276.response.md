Postcondition: **`n` is 3. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', then `nx` is updated to `nx` plus `xx[i][j - 1]`. Otherwise, if either `i` or `j` is in the list `sb` up to the index `n // 4 - 1`, then `nx` is updated to `nx` plus 'S'. If neither `i` nor `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is updated to include 'F' at the end.**
