The code attempts to concatenate the string 'F' to the variable `nx`. However, the initial state does not specify the initial value of `nx`. Assuming `nx` was initially a string, after the operation, `nx` will be that initial string concatenated with 'F'. Since the initial value of `nx` is not provided, we can only describe the change to `nx`.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `j` is 3, `nx` is the initial value of `nx` concatenated with 'F'**.
