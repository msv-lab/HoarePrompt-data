Postcondition: **`n` is 3, `j` is 3, and `nx` is updated based on the condition `xx[i][j - 1] != '?'`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is `nx + xx[i][2]`. Otherwise, `nx` is either the initial value of `nx` concatenated with 'F' or a string ending with 'S', depending on whether `i` or `j` is found in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`.**
