The code `b[i] += 1` increments the value at the index `i` of the list `b` by 1. The initial state does not provide the values of `b` or `i`, but we know that the value at `b[i]` is increased by 1. The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `b[i]` is incremented by 1**.
