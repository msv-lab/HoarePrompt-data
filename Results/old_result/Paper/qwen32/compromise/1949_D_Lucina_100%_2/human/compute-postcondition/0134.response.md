The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is some value (let's say `k`), and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` should be `k + 1`. Since `n` is already given to be greater than or equal to 1, no adjustment is needed for `n`.

The states of `sa`, `n`, `nx`, `xx`, `i`, and any other variables outside the loop head do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`sa` is the initial state, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `k + 1`, `nx` is set based on the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`**.

Since `j` was `k` at the end of the last iteration, it should be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration. The value of `nx` will be recalculated based on the new value of `j`.

State: **`sa` is the initial state, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `nx` is set based on the value of `xx[i][1]`**

If we assume `k` was 1 (the first iteration), then `j` should be 2 for the next iteration. The value of `nx` will be determined by `xx[i][1]`. 

Therefore, the final state before the next iteration is:
State: **`sa` is the initial state, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2**
