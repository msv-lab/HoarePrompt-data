The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was some value such that the loop just finished executing for that `j`.

To execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, provided that it is still less than or equal to `n + 1`.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` except `a[i]` which is 1 and `a[j]` which is 2 if the character at index `j - 1` in `x` is 'F'. Otherwise, `a` remains a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. `b` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` except `b[j]` which is 2 if `j` is the same as `i` or `b[j]` is 1 if `j` is different from `i` if the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is 'S'. If the character at position `j - 1` in `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', `b` also remains a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, and `x` is the user's input string. `j` is incremented by 1**
