Postcondition: **`nx` is a string that includes either the character `xx[i][j - 1]` (if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?') or 'F' or 'S' (if `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', depending on whether `i` or `j` (or both) are in the list `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`). If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` is further followed by the character `xx[i][j]` (if `xx[i][j]` is not '?') or 'F' or 'S' (if `xx[i][j]` is '?', depending on whether `i` or `j + 1` (or both) are in the list `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`). If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', `nx` is followed by 'F' if `i` or `j` (or both) are in the list `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise followed by 'S'. `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is `j + 1`.**
