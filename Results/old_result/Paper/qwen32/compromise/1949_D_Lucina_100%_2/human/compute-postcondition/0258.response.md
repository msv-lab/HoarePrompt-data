Output State: **`n` is 3, `a` is [1, 3, 4, 4], `b` is [1, 2, 3, 3], `xx` is ['', 'FSF', 'SSF', 'SFF'], `sa` is [], `sb` is [], `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `nx` is 'S'**

Explanation: The value of `nx` is updated by appending `xx[i][j - 1]`. Given `i` is 2 and `j` is 4, `xx[2][4 - 1]` is `xx[2][3]`, which is `'SFF'[3]` resulting in `'S'`. All other variables remain unchanged.
