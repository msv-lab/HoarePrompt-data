Output State: **`n` is 3, `a` is [1, 3, 4, 4], `b` is [1, 2, 3, 3], `xx` is ['', 'FSF', 'SSF', 'SFF'], `sa` is [], `sb` is [], `i` is 2, `nx` is 'S', and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'**

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. All other variables remain unchanged.
