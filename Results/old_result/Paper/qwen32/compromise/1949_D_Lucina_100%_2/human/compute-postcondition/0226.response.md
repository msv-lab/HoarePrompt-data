The code snippet provided is attempting to concatenate a substring from `xx[i][j - 1]` to `nx`. However, the initial state does not include `nx`, so we can assume `nx` is an empty string or not defined. Since `nx` is not defined, we will treat it as an empty string for the purpose of this task.

Given:
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 2
- `xx` is `['', 'FSF', 'SSF', 'SFF']`

We need to find `xx[i][j - 1]`:
- `i` is 1, so `xx[i]` is `xx[1]` which is `'FSF'`
- `j - 1` is 1, so `xx[i][j - 1]` is `xx[1][1]` which is `'S'`

Thus, `nx` becomes `'S'`.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `a` is [1, 3, 4, 4], `b` is [1, 2, 3, 3], `xx` is ['', 'FSF', 'SSF', 'SFF'], `sa` is [], `sb` is [], `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `nx` is 'S'**.
