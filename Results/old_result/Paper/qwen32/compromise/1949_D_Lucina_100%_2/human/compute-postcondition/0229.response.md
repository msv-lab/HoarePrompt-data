Postcondition: ***`n` is 3, `a` is [1, 3, 4, 4], `b` is [1, 2, 3, 3], `xx` is ['', 'FSF', 'SSF', 'SFF'], `sa` is [], `sb` is [], `i` is 1, `j` is 2. If `i` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, the program does not modify the variables further. Otherwise, a `NameError` occurs because `nx` is not defined.***

Since `n // 4 - 1` evaluates to `-1`, `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` is an empty list, making the condition `i in sb[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sb[:n // 4 - 1]` always false. Therefore, the else part is always executed, leading to a `NameError` due to the undefined variable `nx`.
