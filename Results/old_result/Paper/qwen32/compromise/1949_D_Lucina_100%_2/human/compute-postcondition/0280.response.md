The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the variable `nx`. However, `nx` is not defined in the initial state, so this operation will result in a `NameError` in Python. Since the variable `nx` is not defined, we can't provide a specific value for `nx` after the operation. The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged.

Given the task constraints, we will assume the operation was intended to be performed on a defined variable. Since `nx` is not defined, we cannot proceed with the operation as is. However, if we assume `nx` was intended to be `n` (which is an integer), the operation would not be valid because you cannot concatenate a string to an integer.

Since the operation as given leads to an error and we cannot make assumptions about undefined variables, the most accurate representation of the state remains with the initial values of `n` and `j`.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `j` is 4**
