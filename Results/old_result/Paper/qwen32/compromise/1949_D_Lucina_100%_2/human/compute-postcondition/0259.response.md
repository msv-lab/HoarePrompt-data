The code snippet provided is `nx += 'S'`. However, the initial state does not include a variable named `nx`. Therefore, it seems there might be a typo or missing information in the initial state. Assuming `nx` was intended to be `xx` (a common typo), the code would append the string 'S' to the current value of `xx[i]` since `i` is 2.

Given `i` is 2, `xx[2]` is 'SSF'. After appending 'S', `xx[2]` becomes 'SSFS'.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `a` is [1, 3, 4, 4], `b` is [1, 2, 3, 3], `xx` is ['', 'FSF', 'SSFS', 'SFF'], `sa` is [], `sb` is [], `i` is 2, `j` is 4**.
