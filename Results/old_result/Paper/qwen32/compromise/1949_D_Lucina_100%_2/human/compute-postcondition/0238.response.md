The initial state provides the values of several variables, including `n`, `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `i`, and `nx`. The specific variable of interest for the print statement is `nx`, which is given as `'FSF'`.

Given the initial state:
- `nx` is explicitly defined as the string `'FSF'`.

The `print(nx)` statement will output the value of `nx`.

Output: **FSF**
