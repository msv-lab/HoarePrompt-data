Postcondition: **`n` is 3, `a` is [1, 3, 4, 4], `b` is [1, 2, 3, 3], `xx` is ['', 'FSF', 'SSF', 'SFF'], `sa` is [], `sb` is []. The current index `i` is such that `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`.**

In this postcondition, all the initial values of the variables from the precondition are retained, and the if condition `b[i] > 0 and a[i] == 0` is now true, specifying the current state of the program after entering the if statement.
