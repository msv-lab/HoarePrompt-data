The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character at position `j - 1` of the string `xx[i]` to the variable `nx`. Given that `i` is 1 and `xx[i]` is `'FSF'`, the character at position `j - 1` will be `'F'` if `j` is 2, `'S'` if `j` is 3, and `'F'` if `j` is 4. Since the specific value of `j` is not provided, we will consider the possible outcomes based on the given conditions.

However, since the problem statement specifies that `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', we can safely assume that `j` is one of the valid indices for the string `'FSF'`.

Let's consider the possible values for `j`:
- If `j` is 2, `xx[i][j - 1]` is `'F'`.
- If `j` is 3, `xx[i][j - 1]` is `'S'`.
- If `j` is 4, `xx[i][j - 1]` is `'F'`.

Given that `nx` is initially `''`, after the operation, `nx` will be `'F'`, `'S'`, or `'F'` depending on the value of `j`.

Since the specific value of `j` is not provided, we will include all possible outcomes in the output state.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `a` is [1, 3, 4, 4], `b` is [1, 2, 3, 3], `xx` is ['', 'FSF', 'SSF', 'SFF'], `sa` is [], `sb` is [], `i` is 1, `nx` is either 'F', 'S', or 'F'**
