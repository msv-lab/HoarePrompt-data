The code snippet provided is:
```
nx += xx[i][j - 1]
```

Given the initial state:
- `sa` is the initial state
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `j` is 2

The code modifies the variable `nx` by adding the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to it. Since `j` is 2, `j - 1` is 1. Therefore, the value `xx[i][1]` is added to `nx`.

Output State: **`sa` is the initial state, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `nx` is increased by `xx[i][1]`**.
