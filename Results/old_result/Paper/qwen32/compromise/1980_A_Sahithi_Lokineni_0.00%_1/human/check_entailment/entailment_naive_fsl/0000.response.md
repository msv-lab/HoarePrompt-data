Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in the calculation of the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to come up with. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level.

The program iterates over the dictionary `d` which contains the count of each difficulty level in the input string. For each difficulty level, it checks if the count is less than or equal to `m` and then adds `m - d[val]` to the answer `ans`. However, this logic is flawed because it doesn't consider that each round requires a unique problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. Therefore, the correct approach should be to determine how many of each required difficulty level are missing for `m` rounds, not just how many are missing compared to `m`.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

### Counterexample:
**Input:**
```
1
7 2
ABCDEFG
```
**Expected Output:**
```
0
```
**Actual Output:**
```
7
```

Explanation of the Counterexample:
- Vlad has exactly one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') for one round.
- For two rounds, he needs two problems of each difficulty level.
- Since he has exactly one problem of each level, he needs one more problem of each level, totaling 7 additional problems.
- However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of additional problems needed and outputs 7, which is incorrect because he actually needs 7 additional problems, not because the logic is flawed but because the program logic is not aligned with the problem requirements.

The correct approach should be to check how many of each required difficulty level are missing for `m` rounds and sum those values.

### Corrected Logic:
For each difficulty level 'A' to 'G', calculate `max(0, m - d[val])` and sum these values to get the correct answer.

The presence of the unused function `func_1()` does not affect the correctness of the program but is unnecessary and should be removed.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
