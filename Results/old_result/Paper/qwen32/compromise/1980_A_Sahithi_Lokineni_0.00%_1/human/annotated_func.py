#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ 5) representing the number of problems in the bank and the number of upcoming rounds, respectively. Following these integers is a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G' representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.
def func_1():
    return 0
    #The program returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and always returns 0, irrespective of any input or conditions.
