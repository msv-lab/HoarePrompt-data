You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]

    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the length of the permutation p. The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) — the number of test cases. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(a)
    #This is printed: a (where a is the list formed by reversing the elements at even indices of the permutation p and keeping the elements at odd indices unchanged)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of a permutation `p`. For each test case, it creates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `n`, reverses the elements at even indices of this list, and prints the modified list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
The task is to find a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \) such that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (with \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) for which both \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

### Program Analysis
The program provided does the following:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.
3. Inside `func_1()`, it creates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to \( n \).
4. It then reverses the elements at even indices of `a`.
5. Finally, it prints the modified list `a`.

### Example Walkthrough
Let's consider the examples given in the problem description:

#### First Example (n = 4)
- Initial list: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
- After reversing even indices (0-based indexing, so 0 and 2 are even): `[4, 2, 1, 3]`
- This is equivalent to `[4, 1, 2, 3]` when 1-based indexing is considered.

#### Second Example (n = 3)
- Initial list: `[1, 2, 3]`
- After reversing even indices: `[3, 2, 1]`
- This is equivalent to `[3, 2, 1]` when 1-based indexing is considered. However, the output given in the problem example is `[1, 2, 3]`, which is also a valid permutation.

### Verification of the Solution
Let's check if the output `[4, 1, 2, 3]` for \( n = 4 \) and `[1, 2, 3]` for \( n = 3 \) satisfy the conditions of the problem:

#### For n = 4
- Check conditions:
  - \( p_1 = 4 \) and \( p_2 = 1 \): 4 does not divide 1.
  - \( p_2 = 1 \) and \( p_3 = 2 \): 1 divides 2, but \( p_3 = 2 \) and \( p_4 = 3 \): 2 does not divide 3.
  - \( p_3 = 2 \) and \( p_4 = 3 \): 2 does not divide 3.
- No pair of \( (i, j) \) satisfies the condition that both \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

#### For n = 3
- Check conditions:
  - \( p_1 = 1 \) and \( p_2 = 2 \): 1 divides 2, but \( p_2 = 2 \) and \( p_3 = 3 \): 2 does not divide 3.
- No pair of \( (i, j) \) satisfies the condition that both \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

### Conclusion
The program generates a valid permutation for the given examples. The approach of reversing the elements at even indices seems to be a strategy that avoids the forbidden conditions. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this strategy appears to work for all valid inputs.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
