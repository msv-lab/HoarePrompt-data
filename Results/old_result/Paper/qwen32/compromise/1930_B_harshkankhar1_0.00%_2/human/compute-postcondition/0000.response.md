Output State: **Each test case contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the length of the permutation p. The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) — the number of test cases. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `a` is a list containing integers from 1 to n.**

Natural Language: The variable `a` is now a list of integers starting from 1 up to `n`, where `n` is the length of the permutation `p` for the current test case. All other conditions and variables from the initial state remain unchanged.
