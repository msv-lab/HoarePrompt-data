Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing half the number of integers on a whiteboard, followed by a line containing `2n` integers (`1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7`). The function processes each test case and returns a result based on these integers.**
