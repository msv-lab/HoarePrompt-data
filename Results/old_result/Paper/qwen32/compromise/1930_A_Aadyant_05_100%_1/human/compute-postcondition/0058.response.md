The code appends the integer value of the second word in `list1` to `list2`. Given that `str` is the second word in `list1`, it is converted to an integer and added to `list2`. The initial state specifies that `list1` has at least 2 words, and `list2` is not specified, implying it could be any list. After the execution, `list2` will have an additional element, which is the integer value of `str`.

Output State: **`list1` is a list of words from `b` that must have at least 2 words, `str` is the second word in `list1`, `list2` now includes the integer value of `str`.**
