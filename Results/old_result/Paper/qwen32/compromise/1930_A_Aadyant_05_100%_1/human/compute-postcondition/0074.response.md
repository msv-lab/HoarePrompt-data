The only variable in the loop head is `fin`, which iterates over the elements of the list `final`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `fin` for the next iteration. Since `final` is a list of sums and `fin` iterates over each element of `final`, at the start of the next iteration, `fin` should be the next element in the list `final`.

Given that `final` must have at least one element and we are at the end of the previous iteration, it means that `fin` has just taken the value of the last element in `final`. For the loop to execute one more time, `final` must have more than one element, and `fin` should be the first element of `final` in the first iteration, the second element in the second iteration, and so on.

Since we are asked to describe the state at the start of the next iteration, we assume that the previous iteration was not the last one, meaning `final` has more than one element, and `fin` should now take the value of the next element in `final`.

State: **`final` is a list of n sums, where each sum is the sum of the integers at even indices of the sorted list of integers provided in each iteration, and `final` must have at least two elements, `fin` is the second element in `final`**
