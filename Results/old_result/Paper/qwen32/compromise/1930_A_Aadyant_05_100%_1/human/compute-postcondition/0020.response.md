The code snippet `s = s + int(list2[i])` will add the integer value of `list2[i]` to the current value of `s`. Given that `s` is initially the integer value of `list2[i]`, after the operation, `s` will be the sum of `list2[i]` and `list2[i+2]` because `i` is increased by 2 before this line of code is executed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `s` is the sum of the integer values of `list2[i]` and `list2[i+2]`; `list2` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `list1`, sorted in ascending order, and `list2` must have at least one element; `a` is a string provided by the user; `b` is a string provided by the user that, when split, results in a non-empty list; `list1` is a list of words obtained by splitting the string `b` and must have at least one element; `str` is the last element in `list1`.**
