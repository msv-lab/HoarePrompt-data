Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `s` is 0; `list2` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `list1`; `a` is a string provided by the user; `b` is a string provided by the user that, when split, results in a non-empty list; `list1` is a list of words obtained by splitting the string `b`, and `list1` must have as many elements as the total number of iterations; `str` is the last element in `list1`.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, `list2` will contain the integer values of all the words in `list1`, which are obtained by splitting the string `b`. The variable `s` remains 0, `n` remains within its initial bounds, and `a` and `b` retain their initial values as provided by the user.
