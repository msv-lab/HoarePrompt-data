### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum score by optimally performing n moves, where each move involves selecting two integers from the list, adding the smaller one to the score, and removing both integers from the list. The goal is to maximize the sum of the smaller integers chosen in each move.

The provided program correctly implements the optimal strategy for this problem. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the program's approach and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program handles multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted in ascending order. Sorting ensures that when we pair numbers, the smaller numbers are paired together, maximizing the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair.

3. **Summing Smaller Numbers**: After sorting, the program sums the numbers at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). This is because in a sorted list, the numbers at even indices will always be the smaller numbers in their respective pairs (since the list is sorted, the number at an even index `i` will be smaller than or equal to the number at index `i+1`).

4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated sum for each test case.

This strategy is optimal because sorting the list and summing the numbers at even indices ensures that we are always adding the smallest possible numbers to our score, which maximizes the final score.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for solving the problem, and its behavior matches the expected output for the given examples.

**Correctness: True**
