The code snippet `kq1 = kq1 + str(x)` appends the string representation of `x` to `kq1`. Therefore, `kq1` will now include the string value of `x` concatenated to its previous value. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a` is a string with at least 1 character, `b` is the string provided by the next user input, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is the minimum of the integer values at index `i` of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values at index `i` of `a` and `b`, `vt` is 1, `kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `x`.**
