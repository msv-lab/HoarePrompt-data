The code snippet `kq1 = kq1 + a[i]` concatenates the character at index `i` of string `a` to the string `kq1`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 before this operation, so the character at the new value of `i` (which was incremented) is added to `kq1`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 before the code snippet, the character at the new index `i` of string `a` is added to `kq1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a` is a string with at least 1 character, `b` is the string provided by the next user input, `i` is incremented by 1, `kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with the character at the new index `i` of string `a`.**
