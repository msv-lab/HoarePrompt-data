The code snippet `kq2 = kq2 + a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the string `kq2`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so the character at index 1 of `a` is added to `kq2`. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a non-empty string provided by the user input; `b` is the new string provided by the user input; `q` is the value of `q` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `i` is 1; `kq1` is the value of `kq1` plus the character at index 1 of `a`; `kq2` is `kq2` plus the character at index 1 of `a`.**
