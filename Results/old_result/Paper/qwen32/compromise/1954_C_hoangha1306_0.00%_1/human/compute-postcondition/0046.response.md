Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a` is a string with at least 1 character, `b` is the string provided by the next user input, `i` is incremented by 1, `kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with the character at the new index `i` of string `a`, and `kq2` is the previous value of `kq2` concatenated with the character at index `i` of string `a`. The loop continues.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `kq1`, and `kq2` are updated as described, and the loop continues to the next iteration.
