Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a new string provided by the user input; `b` is a new string provided by the user input; `kq1` is an empty string; `kq2` is an empty string; `vt` is 0; `q` is `q + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a string provided by user input with length at least 1; `b` is a string provided by user input; `q` is `q + 1`. If the characters at index `i` in `a` and `b` are equal, `kq1` is the string containing the character `a[i]` and `kq2` is the string `a[i]`; otherwise, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `vt` is 1 if it was 0, and `kq1` and `kq2` are set based on the comparison of `a[i]` and `b[i]`: `kq1` is the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is the string representation of `y` if `a[i]` is not greater than `b[i]`, otherwise `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a string provided by user input with length at least 1; `b` is a string provided by user input; `q` is `q + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i] == b[i]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated to include the character `a[i]` appended to them. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`. If `vt` was 0, then `vt` is now 1, `kq1` is concatenated with `str(x)` if `a[i] > b[i]` otherwise with `str(y)`, and `kq2` is concatenated with `str(y)` if `a[i] > b[i]` otherwise with `str(x)`. If `vt` was not 0, then `kq1` is concatenated with `str(y)` and `kq2` is concatenated with `str(x)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` and `b` are strings provided by user input with `a` having a length of at least 1; `q` and `i` are each incremented by 1. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are each concatenated with `a[i]`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`. If `vt` was 0, it is now 1, `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `x` if `a[i] > b[i]`, otherwise with the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `y` if `a[i] > b[i]`, otherwise with the string representation of `x`. If `vt` was not 0, `kq1` is concatenated with `str(y)` and `kq2` is concatenated with `str(x)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
