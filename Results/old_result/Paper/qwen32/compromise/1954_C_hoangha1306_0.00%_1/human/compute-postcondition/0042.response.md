Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a` is a string with at least 1 character, `b` is the string provided by the next user input, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are each concatenated with `a[i]`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`. If `vt` is 0, `vt` is updated to 1, `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `x` if `a[i] > b[i]` or `y` otherwise, and `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `y` if `a[i] > b[i]` or `x` otherwise. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `x`.**
