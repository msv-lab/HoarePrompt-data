Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a string provided by user input with length at least 1; `b` is a string provided by user input; `kq1` is a string containing the character `a[i]`; `kq2` is the string `a[i]`; `vt` is 0; `q` is `q + 1`. The characters at the `i`-th position of `a` and `b` are equal.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply moves to the next iteration of the loop, so all the conditions and values remain the same.
