The value of `kq1` is updated by appending the character at index `i` of string `a` to it. Since `kq1` was initially an empty string `''`, after this operation, `kq1` will be equal to the character at index `i` of `a`. The values of other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a non-empty string provided by the user input; `b` is the new string provided by the user input; `kq1` is the character at index `i` of `a`; `kq2` is ''; `vt` is 0; `q` is the value of `q` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `i` is 0; the character at index `i` of `a` is equal to the character at index `i` of `b`.**
