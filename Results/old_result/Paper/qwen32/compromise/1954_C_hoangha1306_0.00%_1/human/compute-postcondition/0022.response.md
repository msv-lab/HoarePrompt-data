Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a` is a string with at least 1 character, `b` is the string provided by the next user input, `kq1` is the string representation of the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `kq2` is the string representation of the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `vt` is 1, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and the character at position `i` in `a` is not equal to the character at position `i` in `b`. If the character at position `i` in `a` is greater than the character at position `i` in `b`, then `kq1` is the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`.**
