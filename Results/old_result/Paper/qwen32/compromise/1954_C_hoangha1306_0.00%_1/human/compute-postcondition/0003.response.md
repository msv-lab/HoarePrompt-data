The code snippet assigns the value of the next user input to the variable `b`. The value of `t` and the initial value of `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is the string provided by the user input; `b` is the string provided by the next user input.**
