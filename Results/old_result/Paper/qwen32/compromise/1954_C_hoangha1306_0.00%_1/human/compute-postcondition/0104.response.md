The provided code snippet appends the character at index `i` (which is 2) of string `a` to `kq1`. This change only affects `kq1`, and all other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the variable `kq1` is updated by appending `a[2]`. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` and `b` are non-empty strings provided by the user input; `q` is the value of `q` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `i` is 2; `kq1` is `kq1` + `a[2]`; `kq2` is unchanged; `x` and `y` are unchanged; `vt` is unchanged.**
