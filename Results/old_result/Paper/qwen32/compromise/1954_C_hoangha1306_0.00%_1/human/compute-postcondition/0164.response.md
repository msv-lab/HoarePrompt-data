The value of `kq1` is updated by appending the character at index `i` of string `a` to `kq1`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `q`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a string provided by user input with length at least 1; `b` is a string provided by user input; `q` is `q + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `kq1` is `kq1` + `a[i]`.**
