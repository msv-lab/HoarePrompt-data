Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a` is a string with at least 1 character, `b` is the string provided by the next user input, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `vt` is 1, `kq1` is the initial value of `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `x` if `a[i] > b[i]` or the string representation of `y` otherwise, `kq2` is the initial value of `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `y` if `a[i] > b[i]` or the string representation of `x` otherwise.**
