You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations. Let's analyze why:

1. **Logic Flaw**: The program attempts to find the maximum subarray sum (`maxi`) and then uses this to calculate the final sum. However, the logic for calculating the maximum subarray sum is flawed. The program does not correctly handle cases where the maximum subarray sum can be increased by including more elements or by considering different subarrays.

2. **Incorrect Formula**: The formula used to calculate the final sum, `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`, is incorrect. The idea is to maximize the sum of the array by repeatedly adding the maximum subarray sum. However, the formula does not correctly account for the number of times the maximum subarray sum can be added.

3. **Handling Negative Numbers**: The program does not correctly handle cases where all numbers in the array are negative. The maximum subarray sum in such cases should be `0` (by choosing an empty subarray), but the program might incorrectly calculate a negative value.

4. **Handling Large Values**: The program does not correctly handle large values of `k`. The formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` can lead to incorrect results due to integer overflow or incorrect logic.

Let's consider a specific test case to demonstrate the issue:

**Test Case**:
```
1
3 3
2 2 8
```

**Expected Output**:
```
96
```

**Explanation of Expected Output**:
- The maximum subarray sum is `12` (the entire array).
- After 3 operations, we can add the sum of the entire array three times, resulting in the array `[2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48]`.
- The sum of this array is `96`.

**Program Output**:
The program will likely output an incorrect value due to the flawed logic and formula.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
