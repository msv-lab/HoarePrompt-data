The provided code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the variable `maxi` to be the maximum value between `c` and the current value of `maxi`. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `ele` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, `l` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least one integer, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`, `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.**
