The code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of the current values of `c` and `maxi`. Given that `c` is 0 and `maxi` is 0, the maximum of these two values is 0. Therefore, the value of `maxi` remains 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input; `l` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least one integer; `ele` is an integer that is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`; `c` is 0; `maxi` is 0.**
