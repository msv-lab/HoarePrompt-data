Postcondition: **`ele` is the next element in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0 and `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `c`. Otherwise, `c` is increased by `ele` and `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of the updated `c` and its previous value.**
