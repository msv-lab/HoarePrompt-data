Postcondition: **`c` is 0 and `maxi` is 0 if `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is greater than `abs(ele)`. Otherwise, `c` is `ele` and `maxi` is the maximum of `ele` and 0. In both cases, `n` remains the first integer from the input, `k` remains the second integer from the input, and `l` remains a list of integers from the input with at least 3 elements, where `ele` is the third element in the list `l`.**
