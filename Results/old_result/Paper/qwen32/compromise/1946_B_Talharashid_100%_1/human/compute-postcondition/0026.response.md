The provided code snippet is `maxi = max(c, maxi)`. This line of code updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `c`. 

Given the initial state, `c` is the sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative numbers in `l` (or 0 if the last element in `l` is negative and `c` was reset), and `maxi` holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray found during the iterations.

After executing the line `maxi = max(c, maxi)`, the value of `maxi` will either remain the same if `maxi` is greater than or equal to `c`, or it will be updated to the value of `c` if `c` is greater than `maxi`. The value of `c` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`c` is the sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative numbers in `l` (or 0 if the last element in `l` is negative and `c` was reset); `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `maxi` and `c`.**
