Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a result based on the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in the list `a`, adjusted by the value of `k`, and prints the result modulo 1,000,000,007.**
