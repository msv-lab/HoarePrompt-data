The only object in the loop head is the variable `ele`, which is an element of the list `l`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `ele` to reflect the next element in the list `l` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `c` is 0
- `maxi` is 0
- `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` is not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop's execution directly)
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input (and are not part of the loop head)
- `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element

Since `ele` is the variable being iterated over in the loop, for the next iteration, `ele` should be the next element in the list `l`.

State: **`c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element**.

However, since the state should only reflect the objects in the loop head, we simplify it to:

State: **`ele` is the next element in the list `l`**.
