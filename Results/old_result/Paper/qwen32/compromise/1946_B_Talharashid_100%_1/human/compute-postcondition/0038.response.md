The value of `c` is incremented by `ele`. The other variables `maxi`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged. The precondition that `either ele is not less than 0 or c is greater than the absolute value of ele` must still hold after the code execution.

Output State: **`c` is `c + ele`, `maxi` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, and either `ele` is not less than 0 or `c + ele` is greater than the absolute value of `ele`.**
