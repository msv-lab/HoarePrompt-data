Output State: **`c` is 0; `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `maxi` and the previous `c`; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input.**

Natural Language: The variable `c` has been reset to 0. The variable `maxi` remains the maximum value it had before, which was the maximum of the previous `maxi` and the previous value of `c`. The variable `i` has been incremented by 1. The variables `n`, `k`, and `l` retain their initial values.
