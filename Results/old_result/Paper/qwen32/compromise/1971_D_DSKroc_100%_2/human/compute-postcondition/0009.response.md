Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `s` is a string of length between 2 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. If the current character at index `i` in `s` is different from the character at index `i + 1`, `count` is 1; otherwise, `count` remains 0. `flag` is 0. The current character at index `i` in `s` is '0' and the character at index `i + 1` in `s` is '1'. `count` is 1.**
