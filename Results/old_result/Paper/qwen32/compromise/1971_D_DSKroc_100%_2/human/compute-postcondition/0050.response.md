Postcondition: **`t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. `s` remains unchanged as it is only being read, not modified. `count` will be the total number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string `s`. `flag` is 0, indicating there is no occurrence of '0' followed by '1' in the string `s`. `q` is incremented by 1 as stated in the initial state.**
