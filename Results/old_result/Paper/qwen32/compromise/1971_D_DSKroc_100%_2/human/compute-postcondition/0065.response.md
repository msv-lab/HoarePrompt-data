Postcondition: **`t` remains unchanged, `s` is the input string that must have at least 1 character, `q` is incremented by 1. If the integer value of the character at index `i` in `s` is less than the integer value of the character at index `i + 1` in `s`, then `count` is 1 and `flag` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0 and `flag` remains 0.**
