Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `s` is a new input string consisting only of the characters '0' and '1' with a length of at least 2, `q` is incremented by 1. If the character at position `i` in `s` is '0' and the character at position `i + 1` is '1', then `flag` is set to 1 and `count` is set to 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0 and `count` remains 0.**
