Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that can lead to incorrect results in certain cases:

1. **Handling of Modulo Operation**: In Python, the modulo operation with a negative number can result in a negative value. For example, `(q - r) % n` can result in a negative number if `q - r` is negative. To ensure the result is always a positive number between 0 and n-1, you should use `(q - r) % n` and then add `n` if the result is negative, or use `(q - r) % n` directly and ensure the result is adjusted correctly. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.

2. **Handling of Zero in the Set**: The code checks for the presence of `0` in the set `ans` and replaces it with `n`. However, this adjustment is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. The modulo operation `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` should naturally give results in the range `[0, n-1]`. If `0` is in the set, it should correspond to player `n` (the last player), but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

To fix these issues, the code should be adjusted to ensure that all calculated positions are correctly within the range `[1, n]`. Here is a corrected version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
def func_4():
    (n, m, x) = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        (r, c) = func_1().split()
        r = int(r)
        temp = set()
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                # Ensure the result is in the range [1, n]
                temp.add((q + r - 1) % n + 1)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                # Ensure the result is in the range [1, n]
                temp.add((q - r - 1) % n + 1)
        ans = temp
    # Convert the set to a sorted list and print
    print(len(ans))
    print(*sorted(ans))
```

In this corrected version, `(q + r - 1) % n + 1` and `(q - r - 1) % n + 1` ensure that the result is always in the range `[1, n]`. This should handle all edge cases correctly.
