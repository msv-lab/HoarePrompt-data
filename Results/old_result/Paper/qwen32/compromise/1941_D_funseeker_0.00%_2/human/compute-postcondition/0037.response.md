The code snippet adds a new element to the set `temp`, which is calculated as `(q + r) % n`. Given the initial state, this new value is added to the existing elements of `temp` if `c` is '1' or '?'. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m` being greater than 0. `ans` is a set containing at least one element. `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n`, `(q - r) % n`, and `(q + r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` contains only `(q + r) % n`. `q` is the next element in the set `ans`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that `temp` now includes the additional value `(q + r) % n` in addition to any values it already contained based on the initial conditions.
