The code snippet converts the variable `r` from a string to an integer. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, and `c`) remain unchanged. Since `r` was originally the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, it is now an integer version of that value.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing the value `x`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`**.
