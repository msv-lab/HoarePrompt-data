The code snippet adds a new element `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. This means that the set `temp` will now include this new element in addition to any elements it already contains.

Based on the initial state, `temp` already contains `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?'. After executing the given code snippet, `temp` will definitely contain `(q + r) % n`, and it may or may not already contain `(q - r) % n` depending on the value of `c`.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, `c`, `_`, and `q`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m` being greater than 0; `ans` is a set containing at least one element; `r` is the first value returned by `func_1().split()` as an integer; `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`; `_` is incremented by 1; `q` is the next element in the set `ans` after the current one; `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n` and possibly `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?'.**
