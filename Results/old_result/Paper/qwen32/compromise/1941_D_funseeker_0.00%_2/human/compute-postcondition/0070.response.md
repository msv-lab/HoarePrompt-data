The code snippet assigns the value of `temp` to `ans`. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, `c`, and `_` remain unchanged. The set `ans` is now updated to contain the values calculated based on the conditions specified for `c`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m` being greater than 0; `ans` is a set containing `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans` if `c` is '?', only `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', and only `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1'; `r` is the first value returned by `func_1().split()` as an integer; `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`; `_` is incremented by 1.**
