Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `ans` is a set containing all values generated from `x` through the specified operations for `m` iterations, and `0` is not an element of `ans`.**

Explanation: The code removes `0` from the set `ans` using the `discard` method. If `0` was present in `ans`, it is now removed. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.
