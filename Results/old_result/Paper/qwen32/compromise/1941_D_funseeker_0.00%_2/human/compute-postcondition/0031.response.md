Output State: **`n`, `m` is one less than the previous value, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing at least one element, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is either '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n`**.

This means that the set `temp` now contains the single element `(q + r) % n`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
