To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's break down the loop and see how the variables `b`, `p`, and `ans` are affected.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
   - `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4.
   - `a` is a list of integers of length n where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4.
   - `s` is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
   - `b` is a list of length n containing elements from `a` in an order determined by the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`.
   - `l` is n, `r` is -1; `ans` is an empty list; `p` is 1.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over the elements of `b` in reverse order.
   - For each element `v` in the reversed `b`, the value of `p` is updated as `p = (p * v) % m`.
   - The updated value of `p` is then appended to the list `ans`.

3. **Final State**:
   - `b` remains unchanged.
   - `p` will be the product of all elements in `b` taken in reverse order, modulo `m`.
   - `ans` will contain the cumulative product values modulo `m` at each step of the loop, starting from the last element of `b` to the first.

Given the loop's behavior, the final state of `ans` will be a list of cumulative products modulo `m` in the order determined by the reversed `b`. The value of `p` at the end of the loop will be the product of all elements in `b` in reverse order, modulo `m`.

Output State: **`b` is a list of length n containing elements from `a` in an order determined by the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`; `l` is n, `r` is -1; `ans` is a list of cumulative products modulo `m` in the order determined by the reversed `b`; `p` is the product of all elements in `b` in reverse order, modulo `m`.**
