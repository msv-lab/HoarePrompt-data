The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of 'W' and 'B' characters. For each grid, it checks if all characters in the first row are the same and different from the last row, or if all characters in the first column are the same and different from the last column. If either condition is met, it outputs 'NO'; otherwise, it outputs 'YES'.
