Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the described operations. The logic in the program is flawed and does not cover all necessary cases.

The program checks two conditions:
1. If the first row has all the same elements and is different from the last row, it prints "NO".
2. If the first column (constructed by taking the first element of each row) has all the same elements and is different from the last column (constructed by taking the last element of each row), it prints "NO".
3. Otherwise, it prints "YES".

However, these conditions are not sufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made the same color. The program does not consider the possibility of making all cells the same color through a sequence of operations on subrectangles.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
3 3
WBW
BWB
WBW
```
The first row is "WBW" and the last row is "WBW", so the first condition is not met. The first column is "WBW" and the last column is "WBW", so the second condition is not met. Therefore, the program would output "YES". However, it is impossible to make all squares the same color in this grid using the described operations.

A more comprehensive approach would involve checking if there is at least one color (either 'W' or 'B') that appears in every row and every column. If such a color exists, then it is possible to make the entire grid that color. Otherwise, it is not possible.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check if there is a color that appears in every row
        color_in_all_rows = set(grid[0])
        for row in grid[1:]:
            color_in_all_rows &= set(row)
        
        # Check if there is a color that appears in every column
        color_in_all_columns = set(grid[0])
        for j in range(m):
            column_color = set(grid[i][j] for i in range(n))
            color_in_all_columns &= column_color
        
        # If there is a color that appears in every row and every column, it's possible
        if color_in_all_rows or color_in_all_columns:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

```

This corrected version checks for the presence of a color in every row and every column, which is necessary and sufficient for determining if the entire grid can be made the same color.
