The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last element in list `a` to `last_row`. Given the initial state, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in `a` repeated twice. After the execution, `last_row` will have this last character appended once more.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 1; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list containing three elements (the first element is the result of the first `input()`, the second element is the result of the second `input()`, and the third element is the result of the third `input()`); `first_row` is the first character of the last element in `a` repeated three times; `last_row` is the last character of the last element in `a` repeated three times; `i` is 1.**
