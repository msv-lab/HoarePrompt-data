Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is an input value), `first_row` is the concatenation of the first characters of all elements in `a`, and `last_row` is the last character of the last element in `a` repeated `n` times. `i` is `n-1`. If the first element of `a` consists of identical characters and is not equal to the last element of `a`, then the condition in the if part holds. Otherwise, either the length of the set of characters in `a[0]` is not equal to 1, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`. Additionally, if the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is equal to 1 and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`, then the condition in the if part holds. Otherwise, either the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not equal to 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.**
