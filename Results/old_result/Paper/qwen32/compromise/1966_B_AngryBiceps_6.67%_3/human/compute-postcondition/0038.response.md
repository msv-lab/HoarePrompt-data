The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` concatenates the first character of the last element in the list `a` to the current value of `first_row`. 

Given that `first_row` is initially the first character of the last element in `a` (which was the first element before the append), after the operation, `first_row` will be the first character of the last element in `a` repeated twice.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing two elements (the first element is the result of the first `input()`, and the second element is the result of the second `input()`), `first_row` is the first character of the last element in `a` repeated twice, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in `a` (which was the first element before the append), `i` is 0.**
