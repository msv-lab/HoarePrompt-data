Output State: **The loop has processed all `t` test cases. For each test case, it has determined whether the given grid of 'W' and 'B' characters meets the specified conditions and printed either 'YES' or 'NO'.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has run for all `t` iterations, it will have checked each of the `t` test cases. For each test case, it will have evaluated the grid of characters and printed 'YES' if the grid does not meet the specific conditions that would result in 'NO'. The conditions for 'NO' are:
1. The first row of the grid consists of identical characters and is not equal to the last row.
2. The first character of each row in the grid is the same, and this character is not the same as the last character of each row in the grid.

If neither of these conditions is met, the program prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the loop terminates, and the program ends.
