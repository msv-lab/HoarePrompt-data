The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last element in the list `a` to `last_row`. Given that `last_row` is initially the last character of the last element in `a` (which is `a[-1][-1]`), after executing the code, `last_row` will be the last character of `a[-1]` repeated twice.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing two elements (the first element is the result of the first `input()`, and the second element is the result of the second `input()`), `first_row` is the first character of the last element in `a` repeated twice, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in `a` repeated twice, `i` is 0.**
