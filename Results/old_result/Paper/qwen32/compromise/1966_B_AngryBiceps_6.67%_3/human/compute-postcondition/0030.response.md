The code snippet provided is `first_row = ''`, which reassigns the value of `first_row` to an empty string. This change impacts only the `first_row` variable, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is a string containing the last character of each input string concatenated together, `i` is `n`.**
