### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the final MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the input array `a`. The logic of the program seems to be based on the following observations:

1. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array. If there is any integer `i` from `0` to `n-1` that does not appear in `a`, then `i` is the MEX.
2. **Alice and Bob's Strategy**: Since Alice starts, she can always choose to maximize the MEX by selecting elements that do not immediately reduce the MEX. Bob, on the other hand, can minimize the MEX by selecting elements that prevent Alice from increasing the MEX.

The program iterates through the numbers from `0` to `n-1` and checks if each number is present in the array `a` using the `Counter` object `mpp`. If a number `i` is not present in `a`, it prints `i` as the MEX and breaks out of the loop. If a number `i` is present exactly once and a previous number was also present exactly once, it prints `i` as the MEX and breaks out of the loop. This logic seems to be based on the idea that if there's a number that appears exactly once, it can be used to maximize the MEX.

However, the logic in the program is not entirely correct. The program does not fully account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Specifically, the program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob and does not consider the optimal choices they would make to maximize or minimize the MEX, respectively.

### Correctness:

The program does not correctly simulate the game and the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. It only checks for the presence of numbers in the array and their counts, but it does not correctly determine the MEX based on the game's rules and the players' strategies.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
