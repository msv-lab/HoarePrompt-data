You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5), followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n). The total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        
        first = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True
        
    #State: After all iterations, `n` is the integer from the last test case, `arr` is the list of integers from the last test case, `mpp` is the Counter object created from `arr` in the last test case, and `first` is `True` if there was any integer in `arr` that occurred exactly once and was not the first such integer encountered, otherwise `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it identifies and prints the smallest integer between 0 and `n-1` that either does not appear in the list or appears exactly once, ensuring that if multiple such integers exist, the smallest one is chosen.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. Let's analyze the code and the problem requirements:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
    - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a` and appending them to `c` (Alice) or deleting them (Bob) until `a` is empty.
    - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
    - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Code Analysis**:
    - The code reads multiple test cases.
    - For each test case, it counts the occurrences of each element in `a` using `Counter`.
    - It then iterates over the range `0` to `n` and checks if the current number `i` is not in `mpp` (the counter dictionary).
    - If `i` is not in `mpp`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
    - If `i` is in `mpp` and its count is 1, it prints `i` and breaks the loop if `first` is `True`.
    - If `i` is in `mpp` and its count is 1, it sets `first` to `True`.

### Issues:
- The code does not simulate the game where both players play optimally. Instead, it directly computes the MEX based on the initial counts of elements in `a`.
- The logic for determining the MEX does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob.
- The code does not handle the strategic moves of Alice and Bob correctly. Alice should aim to maximize the MEX, while Bob should aim to minimize it. This involves a more complex strategy than simply checking the counts of elements.

### Example Case Where the Code Fails:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
4
0 0 1 2
```
- According to the optimal strategy:
  - Alice can pick `3` (not present initially) and append it to `c`.
  - Bob can then pick any element (e.g., `0`).
  - Alice can pick `3` again (if not already picked) or another element to maximize the MEX.
  - Bob continues to minimize the MEX.
- The final `c` might be `[3, 0, 1, 2]` or a similar configuration, which would have a MEX of `4`.

However, the provided code will output `3` because it directly checks the counts and does not simulate the game.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly simulate the game and determine the MEX after optimal play by both Alice and Bob. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
