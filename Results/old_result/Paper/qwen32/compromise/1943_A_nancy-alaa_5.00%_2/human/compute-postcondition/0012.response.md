Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each element in `arr`, and `first` is `True`. The current element `i` in `mpp` has a frequency of 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The values of `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `first` remain unchanged. The code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
