Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `first` is True, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `first = True` does not change the value of `first` since it is already `True`. Therefore, the values of all other variables remain unchanged.
