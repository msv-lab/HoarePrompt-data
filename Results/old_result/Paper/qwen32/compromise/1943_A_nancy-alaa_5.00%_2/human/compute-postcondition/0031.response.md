The given code snippet consists of a single line: `break`. This statement will terminate the most internal loop or if statement it is placed in. No changes are made to the values of the variables `i` and `n` by this statement. Therefore, the values of `i` and `n` remain the same as they were in the initial state. The condition `n` is greater than `i` and the condition about `i` not being a key in `mpp` leading to a break are still valid as they are preconditions and not affected by the `break` statement.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 2` and `n` is greater than `i`. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
