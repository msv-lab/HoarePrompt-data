Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- `i` is explicitly set to 0.
- `first` is a boolean variable set to False, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `n` must be greater than 0, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `mpp` is a Counter object representing the counts of each element in `arr`, but it is not used in the print statement.
- The current value of `i` (which is 0) is not a key in `mpp`, but this information is not relevant to the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(i)
```

Since `i` is explicitly set to 0, the print statement will output the value of `i`.

Output: **0**
