The code snippet initializes a boolean variable `first` to `False`. None of the other variables (`n`, `arr`, or `mpp`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is `False`.**
