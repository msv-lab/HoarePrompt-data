Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (representing the number of elements) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (where each `a_i` is between 0 and `n-1`). The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the given constraints.**
