To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the `print` statement.

### Initial State:
1. `i` is 1.
2. `first` is determined by whether `mpp[i]` is 1, but its value is not directly relevant to the `print(i)` statement.
3. `n` is greater than 0, but its exact value is not provided.
4. `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input.
5. `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the counts of each element in `arr`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly stated to be 1.
- The `print(i)` statement directly prints the value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
Since `i` is explicitly given as 1, the print statement will output the value 1.

Output: **1**
