To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`i` is `i + 2`**: This indicates that `i` is being updated to its current value plus 2. However, without knowing the initial value of `i`, we can only describe it in terms of its updated value.
2. **`n` is greater than `i`**: This tells us that `n` is some value that is larger than the updated `i`.
3. **If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of**: This implies that there is some control flow based on whether `i` exists as a key in the dictionary `mpp`. If `i` is not a key, the control flow exits the loop or if statement.

### Analysis:
- Since `i` is updated to `i + 2`, the value of `i` at the point of the `print(i)` statement is `i + 2`.
- The condition `n > i` does not directly affect the value of `i` that is printed, it only provides a constraint on the possible values of `n`.
- The condition related to `mpp` (the dictionary) does not affect the value of `i` directly either, but it controls the flow of the program, possibly preventing the `print(i)` statement from being reached if `i` is not a key in `mpp`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, the value of `i` that will be printed is `i + 2` (where `i` is its value before the increment). However, without the initial value of `i` or the context of the loop or if statement, we can only describe the printed value in terms of the updated `i`.

Output: **i + 2 (where i is the value of i before the increment)**
