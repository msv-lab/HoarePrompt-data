Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `first` is True, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is True, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
