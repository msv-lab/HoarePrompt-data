Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `n` must be greater than 0.
2. `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
3. `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each element in `arr`.
4. `first` is `True`.
5. The current element `i` in `mpp` has a frequency of 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` refers to the current element in the `mpp` Counter object.
- The `mpp` Counter object contains elements from the list `arr` as keys and their frequencies as values.
- It is given that the current element `i` in `mpp` has a frequency of 1. This means that `i` appears exactly once in the list `arr`.

### Conclusion:
Since `i` is an element from `arr` that appears exactly once, the print statement will output this specific element `i`.

### Output:
Output: **i (where i is an element in the list arr that appears exactly once)**

However, to make it more precise and match the format of the previous examples, we can state the output as:
Output: **i (where i is an element in the list `arr` with a frequency of 1 in `mpp`)**
