There are multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The function will interact with an external system to find indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized using at most 3n queries per test case. Each query involves four indices a, b, c, d (0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n) and returns the comparison result of (p_a | p_b) and (p_c | p_d). The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
