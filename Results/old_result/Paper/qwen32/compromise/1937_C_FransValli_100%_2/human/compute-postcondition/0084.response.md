To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop evolves and what conditions must be met for each iteration.

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. In each iteration, the program prints a query and reads a response. The response can be `'<'`, `'>'`, or `'='`. However, the code only updates `maxi` if the response is `'<'`. The variable `maxi` keeps track of the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`.

After all iterations, the loop will have considered all indices from `1` to `n-1`. The final value of `maxi` will be the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`. If no response was `'<'`, `maxi` will remain `0`.

The variables `arr` and `mini` are mentioned in the initial description but are not updated in the loop body provided, so their values remain unchanged throughout the loop.

Given this, the output state after all iterations will be:

- `t` remains the same as the initial value.
- `n` remains the same as the initial value.
- `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`.
- `arr` remains unchanged as per the initial description.
- `mini` remains unchanged as per the initial description.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the input integer, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, `arr` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to n-1) that received a response of `'='`, or the last index that received a `'<'` response, `mini` is the smallest index among those in `arr` for which the response was `'>'` when compared to the previous `mini`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `maxi` will be the largest index where the response was `'<'`. All other variables remain as they were initially, except for `maxi` which has been updated based on the responses received during the loop iterations.
