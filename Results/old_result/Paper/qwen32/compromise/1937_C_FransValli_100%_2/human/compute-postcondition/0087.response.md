Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
2. **`n`**: Must be greater than 1. Again, this variable is not used in the print statement, so it is irrelevant for determining the output.
3. **`maxi`**: The largest index \(i\) for which the response was `'<'`. The exact value of `maxi` is not provided in the initial state, so we will denote it as `maxi`.
4. **`arr`**: Contains only one element, which is `[0]`. Therefore, `arr[0]` is always `0`.
5. **`mini`**: The smallest index among those in `arr` for which the response was `'>'` when compared to the previous `mini`. The exact value of `mini` is not provided in the initial state, so we will denote it as `mini`.
6. **`i`**: This variable is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value. However, it appears in the print statement, so we must include it in our description.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

- **`'?'`**: This is a literal string that will be printed as is.
- **`maxi`**: This is the largest index \(i\) for which the response was `'<'`. Since the exact value of `maxi` is not provided, we will represent it as `maxi`.
- **`arr[0]`**: Since `arr` contains only one element `[0]`, `arr[0]` is always `0`.
- **`maxi`**: This is the same as the previous `maxi`, so it will also be represented as `maxi`.
- **`i`**: The value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, so we will represent it as `i`.

### Final Output:
Based on the analysis, the output will be:
Output: **? maxi 0 maxi i (where maxi is the largest index for which the response was '<' and i is an undefined variable)**
