The code snippet reads an input value and assigns it to the variable `res`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `maxi`, `mini`, or `arr`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be at least 2, `maxi` is 0, `mini` is the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`, `arr` contains all indices `i` from 1 to `n-1` for which the response was `'='`, or the last index `i` for which the response was `'<'` and all subsequent indices `i` for which the response was `'='`, `res` is the input value.**
