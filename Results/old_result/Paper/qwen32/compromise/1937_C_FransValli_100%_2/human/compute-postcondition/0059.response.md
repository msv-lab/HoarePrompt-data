To determine the output, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This variable is not used in the provided print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
2. **`n`**: An input integer. This variable is also not used in the provided print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
3. **`maxi`**: The largest index `i` (from 1 to \(n-1\)) for which the user input was `'<'`. This variable is not used in the provided print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
4. **`arr`**: A list containing indices `i` (from 1 to \(n-1\)) that received a response of `'='`, or the last index that received a `'<'` response. The list must have at least two elements.
5. **`item`**: The next element in `arr[1:]`. Since `arr` has at least two elements, `item` will be the second element of `arr`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```
However, there is a variable `mini` that is not defined in the initial state. Given the context and the structure of the print statement, it seems likely that `mini` should be `arr[0]` (the first element of `arr`).

### Deriving the Output:
1. **`'?'`**: This is a literal string.
2. **`mini`**: Assuming `mini` is `arr[0]`, this will be the first element of the list `arr`.
3. **`mini` again**: This will be the same as the first element of the list `arr`.
4. **`item`**: This is the second element of the list `arr` (i.e., `arr[1]`).
5. **`item` again**: This will be the same as the second element of the list `arr`.

### Final Output:
Given the assumptions and the structure of the print statement, the output will be:
Output: **? [arr[0]] [arr[0]] [arr[1]] [arr[1]] (where arr[0] is the first element of the list arr and arr[1] is the second element of the list arr)**
