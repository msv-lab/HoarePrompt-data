Let's break down the given initial state and analyze what is printed by the `print` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
2. **`n`**: At least 2.
3. **`maxi`**: This variable is set to `i` if `res` is `'<'`, otherwise, it remains unchanged.
4. **`mini`**: The smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`.
5. **`arr`**: 
   - Contains all indices `i` from 1 to `n-1` for which the response was `'='`.
   - Or, the last index `i` for which the response was `'<'` and all subsequent indices `i` for which the response was `'='`.
6. **`res`**: The new input value.
7. **`i`**: Incremented by 1.

### Key Points:
- `maxi` is set to `i` only if `res` is `'<'`. Otherwise, it retains its previous value.
- `mini` is defined based on the smallest index in `arr` where the response was `'>'`.
- `arr` is a list of indices based on the responses `'='` or the last `'<'` followed by `'='`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 before the `print` statement is executed.

### Print Statement Analysis:
```
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

- The first `maxi` is the value of `maxi` before the `print` statement.
- The second `maxi` is also the value of `maxi` before the `print` statement.
- The first `i` is the value of `i` before the `print` statement.
- The second `i` is also the value of `i` before the `print` statement.

### Explanation:
- Since `i` is incremented before the `print` statement, the value of `i` printed will be the value it had just before the increment.
- `maxi` remains unchanged unless `res` was `'<'` before the increment of `i`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output `'?'` followed by the current value of `maxi` twice, and the current value of `i` (before it is incremented) twice.

### Output:
Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i] (where [maxi] is the value of maxi and [i] is the value of i before it is incremented)**
