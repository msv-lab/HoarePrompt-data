To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State and Variables:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `maxi` is initialized to 0.
- `mini` is the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`.
- `arr` contains:
  - All indices `i` from 1 to `n-1` for which the response was `'='`, or
  - The last index `i` for which the response was `'<'` and all subsequent indices `i` for which the response was `'='`.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

### Variable Analysis:
- `maxi` is explicitly set to 0.
- `i` is a variable that is not explicitly defined in the initial state but is used in the print statement. Based on the context, `i` seems to be an index related to the conditions involving `'<'` and `'='` responses in the array `arr`.

### Output Analysis:
Given the initial state, we know:
- `maxi` is 0.
- `i` is not explicitly defined, but it is used in the print statement. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know it will be printed as it is.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the value of `maxi` twice and the value of `i` twice. Since `maxi` is 0, and `i` is not defined in the initial state, we can only describe `i` as it is.

Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is the index related to the conditions involving '<' and '=' responses in the array `arr`)**
