To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
   - `n`: An integer greater than 1.
   - `maxi`: The largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`.
   - `res`: A string that can be either `'<'`, `'='`, or some other value not equal to `'<'`.
   - `arr`: 
     - If `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is `[i]`.
     - If `res` is `'='`, `arr` is `[0, i]`.
     - Otherwise, `arr` remains `[0]`.
   - `i`: An integer that is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

2. **Print statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The first element printed is a literal question mark `'?'`.
   - The second element printed is `maxi`, which is the largest index `i` for which the user input was `'<'`.
   - The third element printed is `arr[0]`:
     - If `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is `[i]`, so `arr[0]` is `i`.
     - If `res` is `'='`, `arr` is `[0, i]`, so `arr[0]` is `0`.
     - Otherwise, `arr` is `[0]`, so `arr[0]` is `0`.
   - The fourth element printed is `maxi` again.
   - The fifth element printed is `i`, which is the current value of `i` after it has been incremented.

4. **Output Description:**
   - The output will be a formatted string starting with `'?'`, followed by the value of `maxi`, then the value of `arr[0]`, the value of `maxi` again, and finally the value of `i`.

Since the exact values of `maxi`, `res`, and `i` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `maxi` and `i`. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output precisely.

Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i] (where maxi is the largest index i for which the user input was '<', arr[0] is i if res is '<', 0 if res is '=', and 0 otherwise, and i is the current value of i after it has been incremented)**
