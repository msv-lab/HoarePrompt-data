To determine the output of the provided print statement, we need to understand the values of `maxi` and `mini` based on the initial state description.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This variable represents the number of test cases, but it does not directly influence the values of `maxi` and `mini` in the context of a single test case.
2. **n**: An input integer which represents the number of elements in a sequence or array.
3. **maxi**: The largest index \(i\) (from 1 to \(n-1\)) for which the user input was `'<'`.
4. **arr**: A list containing all indices \(i\) (from 1 to \(n-1\)) that received a response of `'='`, or the last index that received a `'<'` response.
5. **mini**: The smallest index among those in `arr` for which the response was `'>'` when compared to the previous `mini`.

### Understanding `maxi` and `mini`:

- **maxi**: This is straightforward. It is the largest index where the response was `'<'`.
- **arr**: This list includes indices where the response was `'='` or the last index where the response was `'<'`. The exact composition of this list depends on the responses received.
- **mini**: This is the smallest index in `arr` where the response was `'>'` compared to the previous `mini`. This means that for each index in `arr`, the response was compared to the previous `mini`, and if it was `'>'`, it became the new `mini`.

### Output Description:

The print statement outputs:
```
print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)
```

- **'!'**: A literal string.
- **maxi**: The largest index where the response was `'<'`.
- **mini**: The smallest index in `arr` where the response was `'>'` compared to the previous `mini`.

### Conclusion:

Given the initial state, the output will be:
- **'!'**: A literal string.
- **maxi**: The largest index \(i\) (from 1 to \(n-1\)) for which the user input was `'<'`.
- **mini**: The smallest index among those in `arr` for which the response was `'>'` when compared to the previous `mini`.

Therefore, the final output is:

Output: **! maxi mini (where maxi is the largest index with '<' response and mini is the smallest index in arr with '>' response compared to the previous mini)**
