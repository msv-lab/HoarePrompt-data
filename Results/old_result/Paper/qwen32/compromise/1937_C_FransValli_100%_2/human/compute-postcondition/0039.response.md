To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state provided and the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
2. **`n`**: Greater than 1 (an integer).
3. **`maxi`**: The largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`.
4. **`res`**: The value of the user input.
5. **`arr`**: A list that is modified based on the value of `res`.
6. **`i`**: An integer that is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- **`'?'`**: This is a literal string that will be printed as is.
- **`maxi`**: This is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`. Note that this value is explicitly mentioned in the initial state.
- **`arr[0]`**: This is the first element of the list `arr`. However, since the initial state does not provide the specific value of `arr[0]`, we can only say that it is the first element of `arr`.
- **`maxi`**: This value is repeated in the print statement. It is the same as described above.
- **`i`**: This is an integer that is incremented by 1 from its previous value. Again, the exact value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, so we can only describe it as the incremented value of `i`.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output a string starting with `'?'`, followed by the value of `maxi`, the first element of `arr`, `maxi` again, and the incremented value of `i`.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i] (where maxi is the largest index i (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was '<', arr[0] is the first element of arr, and i is the incremented value of i)**
