The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. In this context, the loop runs a number of times equal to the integer input `n`. The loop head does not directly involve `t`, `n`, `maxi`, `mini`, or `arr`. However, since the loop depends on the input `n`, we need to consider how the loop count is affected.

Given that the loop runs `int(input())` times, the loop will execute one more time if the input `n` is greater than the current iteration count. Since the loop variable `_` does not change the state of `n`, `t`, `maxi`, `mini`, or `arr`, we only need to ensure that `n` is such that the loop can execute one more time.

Let's assume the loop has run `k` times so far. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least `k + 1`.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is the input integer; `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`; `mini` is the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`; `arr` contains all indices `i` from `1` to `n-1` for which the response was `'='`, or the last index `i` for which the response was `'<'` and all subsequent indices `i` for which the response was `'='`.

Since the loop has just finished an iteration, let's say it has run `k` times. For the next iteration, `k` would be incremented by 1, so the loop will run `k + 1` times if `n` is at least `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is the input integer and must be at least `k + 1` where `k` is the current iteration count; `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`; `mini` is the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`; `arr` contains all indices `i` from `1` to `n-1` for which the response was `'='`, or the last index `i` for which the response was `'<'` and all subsequent indices `i` for which the response was `'='`.**
