The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration of the loop. According to the provided state, `i` has already been incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.
- The loop condition is `i` in `range(1, n)`, meaning the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
- No other variables in the loop head need adjustment because they are not part of the loop condition.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration where `i` has already been incremented, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this increment.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is `i` if `res` was `'<'`, otherwise `maxi` remains unchanged, `arr` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to n-1) that received a response of `'='`, or the last index that received a `'<'` response, `mini` is the smallest index among those in `arr` for which the response was `'>'` when compared to the previous `mini`, `res` is the input string, `i` is `i + 1`**. 

Since `i` has already been incremented, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is `i` if `res` was `'<'`, otherwise `maxi` remains unchanged, `arr` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to n-1) that received a response of `'='`, or the last index that received a `'<'` response, `mini` is the smallest index among those in `arr` for which the response was `'>'` when compared to the previous `mini`, `res` is the input string, `i` is the current value of `i` after increment**.
