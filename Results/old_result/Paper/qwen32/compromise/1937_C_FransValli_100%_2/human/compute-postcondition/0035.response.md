The code snippet appends the current value of `i` to the list `arr`. This means that the list `arr` will now include the new value of `i` as its last element. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `maxi`, `res`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`. `res` is the value of the user input. If `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is `[i]` or `[i, i]` depending on previous appends. If `res` is `'='`, `arr` is `[0, i]` or `[0, i, i]` depending on previous appends. Otherwise, `arr` is `[0, i]`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
