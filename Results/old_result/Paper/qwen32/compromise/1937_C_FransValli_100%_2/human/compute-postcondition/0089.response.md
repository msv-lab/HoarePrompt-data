Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`. The current response `res` is `'<'`, so `arr` will now contain the current index `i` in addition to its previous content `[0]`. `mini` is the smallest index among those in `arr` for which the response was `'>'` when compared to the previous `mini`.**
