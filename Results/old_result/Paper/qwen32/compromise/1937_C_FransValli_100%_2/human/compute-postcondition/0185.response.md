Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` or 0 if no such response was received, `mini` is `arr[1]` if `res` is `'>'`, otherwise `mini` remains `arr[0]`, `arr` contains at least two elements where the response was `'='`, `item` is `arr[2]`, `res` is the input response.**

In natural language, the output state means that the variable `res` has been updated to hold the value of the input response, while all other variables (`t`, `n`, `maxi`, `mini`, `arr`, and `item`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
