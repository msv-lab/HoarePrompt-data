To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **Variables and Their Descriptions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This variable is a loop counter or a limit, but it is not used in the print statement.
   - `n`: At least 2. This is the size of the array `arr` plus one, as `arr` contains indices from 1 to `n-1`.
   - `maxi`: This variable is set to `i` if `res` is `'<'`. Otherwise, it remains unchanged. `maxi` is not explicitly initialized, but we can assume it has some value before the print statement.
   - `mini`: This variable is the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`. Again, `mini` is not explicitly initialized, but it is mentioned in the context.
   - `arr`: This list contains all indices `i` from 1 to `n-1` for which the response was `'='`, or the last index `i` for which the response was `'<'` and all subsequent indices `i` for which the response was `'='`.
   - `res`: This is the input value that determines the behavior of `maxi` and `mini`.
   - `i`: This is an index that is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)`.
   - It prints a literal `'?'` followed by the value of `maxi` twice, and the value of `i` twice.

### Determining the Output:
- **Value of `maxi`:** The value of `maxi` depends on the previous responses (`res`). If `res` was `'<'` at some point, `maxi` would have been set to that `i` value. Otherwise, `maxi` retains its previous value.
- **Value of `i`:** The value of `i` is the current index being processed or the last index that met certain conditions (either `'<'` or `'='`).

Since the exact values of `maxi` and `i` are not explicitly given, we can only describe them in terms of their roles and the conditions that determine them.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output a `'?'` followed by the current value of `maxi` twice and the current value of `i` twice.

Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i] (where [maxi] is the value of maxi and [i] is the value of i)**
