To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the for loop to execute, we need to analyze the loop head:

```
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if and only if the range `(1, n)` is non-empty, which means `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 1 in the first iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is an input integer
- `maxi` is 0

We need to adjust the state such that the loop can execute. The only variables we can adjust are those in the loop head, which means `i` and `n`. However, `i` is initialized by the loop itself, so we only need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 1, `maxi` is 0**
