Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the input integer, `maxi` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`, `arr` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to n-1) that received a response of `'='`, or the last index that received a `'<'` response, `mini` is `arr[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for item in arr[1:]:
    print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '>':
        mini = item


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the input integer, `maxi` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`, `arr` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to n-1) that received a response of `'='`, or the last index that received a `'<'` response, and `arr` must have at least two elements, `mini` is `arr[0]`, `res` is the value of the input received. If `res` is `'>'`, `mini` is updated to the value of `item`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the input integer, `maxi` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`, `arr` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to n-1) that received a response of `'='`, or the last index that received a `'<'` response, and `arr` must have at least two elements. If `res` is `'>'`, then `mini` is set to `item` and `item` is updated to the next element in `arr[1:]`. Otherwise, `mini` and `item` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the input integer, `maxi` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`, `arr` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to n-1) that received a response of `'='`, or the last index that received a `'<'` response, and `arr` must have at least two elements, `item` is the next element in `arr[1:]`, `res` is the user input. If `res` is `'>'`, `mini` is set to the value of `item`. Otherwise, `mini` is not defined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
