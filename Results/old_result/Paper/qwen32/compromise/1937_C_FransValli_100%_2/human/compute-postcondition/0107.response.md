The code snippet provided appends the current value of `i` to the list `arr`. This means the list `arr` will have an additional element, which is the value of `i`. The values of other variables (`t`, `n`, `maxi`, `mini`, `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, `mini` is the smallest index among those in `arr` for which the response was `'>'` when compared to the previous `mini`, `res` is the new input string, `arr` is updated to include `i` at the end, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
