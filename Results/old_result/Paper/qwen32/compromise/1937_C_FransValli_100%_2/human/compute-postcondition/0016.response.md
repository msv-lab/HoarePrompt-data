The code snippet `res = input()` will overwrite the previous value of `res` with a new value provided by the user input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `maxi`, and `i`) remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 5, `res` is the value of the new user input, `maxi` is 4 if the previous `res` was '<', otherwise `maxi` remains 0, and `i` is 5.**
