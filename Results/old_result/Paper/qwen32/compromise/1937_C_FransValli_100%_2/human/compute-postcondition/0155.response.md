The code snippet assigns a new list `[i]` to the variable `arr`. Since the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we can only say that `arr` will now hold the value `[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` or `0` if no such response was received, `mini` is the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`, `arr` is `[i]`, `res` is the input value, and `res` equals `'<'`.**
