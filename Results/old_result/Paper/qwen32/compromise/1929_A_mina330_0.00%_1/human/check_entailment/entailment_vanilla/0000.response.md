Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array `a`, which is defined as the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`. This means we need to maximize the sum of consecutive differences in the array.

### Key Insight:
To maximize the sum of consecutive differences, we should arrange the array in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. One effective strategy is to sort the array and then alternate between the largest and smallest remaining elements. However, the provided solution takes a simpler approach by sorting the array and summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements.

### Provided Solution Analysis:
The provided solution sorts the array and then calculates the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements up to the middle of the array. This approach is not optimal for maximizing the beauty of the array. The correct approach should involve alternating between the largest and smallest elements to maximize the sum of differences.

### Correct Approach:
1. Sort the array.
2. Initialize two pointers: one at the start (`left`) and one at the end (`right`) of the array.
3. Calculate the beauty by summing the differences between the elements pointed by `right` and `left` while moving the pointers towards each other.

### Correctness of Provided Solution:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the approach needed to maximize the beauty of the array. It only sums the differences between the largest and smallest elements up to the middle of the array, which does not guarantee the maximum beauty.

### Example:
For the input `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, the correct rearrangement to maximize beauty would be `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, resulting in a beauty of `(54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57`. However, the provided solution would not yield this result.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
