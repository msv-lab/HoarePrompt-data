You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        print(kq)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on, until it has considered half of the list. It then prints this sum for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array `a`, which is defined as the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`. This means we need to maximize the sum of consecutive differences in the array.

### Key Insight:
To maximize the sum of consecutive differences, we should arrange the array in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. One effective strategy is to sort the array and then alternate between the largest and smallest remaining elements. However, the provided solution takes a simpler approach by sorting the array and summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements.

### Provided Solution Analysis:
The provided solution sorts the array and then calculates the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements up to the middle of the array. This approach is not optimal for maximizing the beauty of the array. The correct approach should involve alternating between the largest and smallest elements to maximize the sum of differences.

### Correct Approach:
1. Sort the array.
2. Initialize two pointers: one at the start (`left`) and one at the end (`right`) of the array.
3. Calculate the beauty by summing the differences between the elements pointed by `right` and `left` while moving the pointers towards each other.

### Correctness of Provided Solution:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the approach needed to maximize the beauty of the array. It only sums the differences between the largest and smallest elements up to the middle of the array, which does not guarantee the maximum beauty.

### Example:
For the input `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, the correct rearrangement to maximize beauty would be `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, resulting in a beauty of `(54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57`. However, the provided solution would not yield this result.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
