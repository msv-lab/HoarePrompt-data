Reasoning: 
The program is designed to find the maximum beauty of the array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the array. To maximize this beauty, the program sorts the array and then calculates the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest, and so on.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:
1. The program reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of elements in the array and the elements themselves.
3. It sorts the array in ascending order.
4. It calculates the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest, and so on, up to the middle of the array.
5. It prints the calculated sum as the maximum beauty for that test case.

This approach works because sorting the array ensures that the differences between the paired elements (largest with smallest, second largest with second smallest, etc.) are maximized, thus maximizing the overall beauty of the array.

Let's verify this with the example provided:
- For the array [2, 1, 3], sorting gives [1, 2, 3]. The beauty is (3-1) + (2-2) = 2.
- For the array [69, 69, 69], sorting gives [69, 69, 69]. The beauty is (69-69) + (69-69) = 0.
- For the array [100, 54, 80, 43, 90], sorting gives [43, 54, 80, 90, 100]. The beauty is (100-43) + (90-54) = 57.
- For the array [3, 4, 3, 3], sorting gives [3, 3, 3, 4]. The beauty is (4-3) + (3-3) = 1.
- For the array [2, 1], sorting gives [1, 2]. The beauty is (2-1) = 1.

All these results match the expected output, confirming that the logic of the program is correct.
