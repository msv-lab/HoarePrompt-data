Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The logic in the program seems to be attempting to maximize the sum of differences by pairing the largest and smallest elements, but it does not correctly implement the strategy to maximize the beauty as defined in the problem.

The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. To maximize this, the array should be sorted in either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order. However, the current implementation only considers a specific pairing strategy that does not guarantee the maximum beauty.

Let's consider a counterexample:

Input:
```
1
4
1 3 2 4
```

Expected Output:
```
6
```

Explanation of Expected Output:
To maximize the beauty, we can sort the array in increasing order: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The beauty is calculated as:
- (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) + (4 - 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

However, sorting in decreasing order `[4, 3, 2, 1]` gives:
- (3 - 4) + (2 - 3) + (1 - 2) = -1 -1 -1 = -3 (not valid since we need positive differences)

But sorting in decreasing order `[4, 3, 2, 1]` and taking absolute differences gives:
- (3 - 4) + (2 - 3) + (1 - 2) = -1 -1 -1 = -3 (not valid since we need positive differences)

Instead, the correct approach is to sort the array in increasing order and calculate the beauty as:
- (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) + (4 - 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

However, the given program would calculate:
- (4 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 3 + 1 = 4 (incorrect)

The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the beauty for all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

So, the Correctness is **False**.
