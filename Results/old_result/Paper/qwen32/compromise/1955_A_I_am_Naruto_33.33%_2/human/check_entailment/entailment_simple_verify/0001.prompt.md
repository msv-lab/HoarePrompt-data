You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective**: Determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts, given the individual price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts.
- **Logic**:
  - If `n` is 1, the cost is simply `a`.
  - If `n` is greater than 1, we need to consider two scenarios:
    1. **Scenario 1 (Regular Purchase)**: Buying each yogurt at the regular price `a`, resulting in a total cost of `a * n`.
    2. **Scenario 2 (Promotion Purchase)**: Buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price `b`, and then buying any remaining yogurt at the regular price `a`. The total cost in this scenario is `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
  - The minimum cost is the smaller value between `ans1` (regular purchase) and `ans2` (promotion purchase).

### Program Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating over each test case.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- If `n` is greater than 1, it calculates:
  - `ans1` as `a * n` (total cost if buying all yogurts at regular price).
  - `ans2` as `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)` (total cost if buying pairs of yogurts at promotional price and any remaining yogurt at regular price).
- It then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
- If `n` is 1, it directly prints `a` as the cost.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described above and handles all edge cases (e.g., when `n` is 1 or when `n` is even or odd).

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
