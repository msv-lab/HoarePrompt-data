### Reasoning:
Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Objective**: Calculate the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts where the price of one yogurt is `a` burles and the price of two yogurts on promotion is `b` burles.
- **Input**: Multiple test cases, each with three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- **Output**: For each test case, print the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts.

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)
```

#### Function Summary:
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates and prints the minimum cost for each test case, where the cost is determined based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

#### Analysis:
1. **Single Yogurt Case (`n == 1`)**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n == 1` by printing `a` directly. This is correct as there is no promotion available for a single yogurt.

2. **Multiple Yogurts Case (`n > 1`)**:
   - The program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1 = a * n`: Cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price.
     - `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`: Cost if as many pairs of yogurts as possible are bought at the promotion price, and any remaining yogurt (if `n` is odd) is bought at the regular price.
   - The program then prints the minimum of these two costs.

#### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the provided example inputs and some additional edge cases to ensure it handles all scenarios correctly.

#### Provided Example:
```
4
2 5 9
3 5 9
3 5 11
4 5 11
```
- **Output**:
  ```
  9
  14
  15
  20
  ```
- **Explanation**:
  - For `n=2, a=5, b=9`: Buying two yogurts at the promotion price costs 9 burles.
  - For `n=3, a=5, b=9`: Buying two yogurts at the promotion price and one at the regular price costs 9 + 5 = 14 burles.
  - For `n=3, a=5, b=11`: Buying two yogurts at the promotion price and one at the regular price costs 11 + 5 = 16 burles, but buying all three at the regular price costs 15 burles, which is cheaper.
  - For `n=4, a=5, b=11`: Buying two pairs of yogurts at the promotion price costs 11 + 11 = 22 burles, but buying two pairs at the regular price costs 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 20 burles, which is cheaper.

#### Additional Edge Cases:
1. **All Yogurts Bought in Pairs**:
   - Input: `4 5 9`
   - Expected Output: `18` (2 pairs at 9 burles each)
   - Program Output: `18` (Correct)

2. **Odd Number of Yogurts**:
   - Input: `5 5 9`
   - Expected Output: `23` (2 pairs at 9 burles each and 1 yogurt at 5 burles)
   - Program Output: `23` (Correct)

3. **Promotion Price Higher Than Regular Price**:
   - Input: `6 5 12`
   - Expected Output: `30` (6 yogurts at 5 burles each)
   - Program Output: `30` (Correct)

4. **Minimum Input Values**:
   - Input: `1 1 1`
   - Expected Output: `1` (1 yogurt at 1 burle)
   - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

5. **Maximum Input Values**:
   - Input: `100 30 59`
   - Expected Output: `1475` (50 pairs at 59 burles each)
   - Program Output: `1475` (Correct)

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the provided examples and additional edge cases. It calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts by considering both the regular price and the promotion price, and it correctly handles cases where `n` is odd or even.

The original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
