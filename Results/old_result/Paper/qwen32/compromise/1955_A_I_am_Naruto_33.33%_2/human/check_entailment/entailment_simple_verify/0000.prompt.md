You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly implements the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- **Objective**: Calculate the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts, where the price of one yogurt is `a` burles and the price of two yogurts on promotion is `b` burles.
- **Input**: Multiple test cases, each with three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- **Output**: For each test case, print the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Single Yogurt Case (`n == 1`)**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n == 1` by printing `a` directly. This is correct as there is no promotion available for a single yogurt.

2. **Multiple Yogurts Case (`n > 1`)**:
   - The program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1 = a * n`: Cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price.
     - `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`: Cost if as many pairs of yogurts as possible are bought at the promotion price, and any remaining yogurt (if `n` is odd) is bought at the regular price.
   - The program then prints the minimum of these two costs.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the provided example inputs and some additional edge cases to ensure it handles all scenarios correctly.

#### Provided Example:
```
4
2 5 9
3 5 9
3 5 11
4 5 11
```
- **Output**:
  ```
  9
  14
  15
  20
  ```
- **Explanation**:
  - For `n=2, a=5, b=9`: Buying two yogurts at the promotion price costs 9 burles.
  - For `n=3, a=5, b=9`: Buying two yogurts at the promotion price and one at the regular price costs 9 + 5 = 14 burles.
  - For `n=3, a=5, b=11`: Buying two yogurts at the promotion price and one at the regular price costs 11 + 5 = 16 burles, but buying all three at the regular price costs 15 burles, which is cheaper.
  - For `n=4, a=5, b=11`: Buying two pairs of yogurts at the promotion price costs 11 + 11 = 22 burles, but buying two pairs at the regular price costs 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 20 burles, which is cheaper.

#### Additional Edge Cases:
1. **All Yogurts Bought in Pairs**:
   - Input: `4 5 9`
   - Expected Output: `18` (2 pairs at 9 burles each)
   - Program Output: `18` (Correct)

2. **Odd Number of Yogurts**:
   - Input: `5 5 9`
   - Expected Output: `23` (2 pairs at 9 burles each and 1 yogurt at 5 burles)
   - Program Output: `23` (Correct)

3. **Promotion Price Higher Than Regular Price**:
   - Input: `6 5 12`
   - Expected Output: `30` (6 yogurts at 5 burles each)
   - Program Output: `30` (Correct)

4. **Minimum Input Values**:
   - Input: `1 1 1`
   - Expected Output: `1` (1 yogurt at 1 burle)
   - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

5. **Maximum Input Values**:
   - Input: `100 30 59`
   - Expected Output: `1475` (50 pairs at 59 burles each)
   - Program Output: `1475` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the provided examples and additional edge cases. It calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts by considering both the regular price and the promotion price, and it correctly handles cases where `n` is odd or even.

**Correctness: **True**.**

The program is correct for every potential case based on the problem description and the examples tested.
