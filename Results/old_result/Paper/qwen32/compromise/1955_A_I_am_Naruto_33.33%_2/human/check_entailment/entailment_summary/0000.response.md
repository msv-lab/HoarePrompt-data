### Reasoning:

The program's logic for calculating the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts is as follows:

1. **Single Yogurt Case (`n == 1`)**:
    - If Maxim needs to buy only one yogurt, the cost is simply `a` burles since buying two yogurts is not applicable here.

2. **Multiple Yogurts Case (`n > 1`)**:
    - **Option 1**: Buy all yogurts at the regular price of `a` burles each. The total cost for `n` yogurts in this case is `a * n`.
    - **Option 2**: Buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price of `b` burles each, and buy any remaining yogurt at the regular price of `a` burles.
        - The number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought is `n // 2`.
        - The number of remaining yogurts (if any) is `n % 2`.
        - The total cost in this case is `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.

The program then prints the minimum of the two calculated costs for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Single Yogurt Case**:
    - When `n == 1`, the program correctly prints `a` since buying two yogurts is not an option.

- **Multiple Yogurts Case**:
    - The program correctly calculates the cost for both options and selects the minimum.
    - For example, in the third test case (`n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`):
        - Option 1: `3 * 5 = 15`
        - Option 2: `11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
        - The program correctly prints `15` as the minimum cost.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost for each test case based on the given inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
