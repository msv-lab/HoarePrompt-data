You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    0 1 0
    5

    -1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1

- Program:
import math

MOD = 1000000007
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if x == 2:
        print(1)
        print(0)
        return
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
    print(len(ansv))
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer input `x`, processes it to determine a sequence of powers of 2 that sum up to `x`, and then prints the length of a derived sequence followed by the elements of that sequence. If the input is 2, it directly prints 1 and 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the construction of the array to achieve exactly X increasing subsequences. There are several issues with the logic used in the program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of X**: The program attempts to decompose X into powers of 2, but this approach does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly X increasing subsequences. The decomposition into powers of 2 is not a direct translation to the number of increasing subsequences.

2. **Array Construction**: The array construction using the subsequence lengths does not ensure that the resulting array has exactly X increasing subsequences. The way the array is constructed and the values appended do not guarantee the correct number of increasing subsequences.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, when X is a large number that cannot be represented by a combination of powers of 2 in a way that fits the problem constraints, the program may not return the correct answer or may not handle it appropriately.

4. **Output Format**: The output format is not strictly adhered to in all cases. The program should print `-1` if it is impossible to find such an array, but the current logic does not properly handle this condition.

To illustrate the issue, consider the case where X is a large number like `13`. The program might not correctly construct an array that has exactly 13 increasing subsequences. The current logic does not ensure that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly X for all possible values of X.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not meet the requirements for every potential case and does not guarantee the correct number of increasing subsequences for all values of X.
