The given code snippet is `mx = max(mx, i - 1)`. This line updates the variable `mx` to be the maximum value between its current value and `i - 1`. The variables `t`, `X`, and `x` are not affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `X`, and `x` retain their initial values. The variable `mx` is updated based on the comparison with `i - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is a non-zero integer updated to `x - 2`, `mx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `i - 1`.**
