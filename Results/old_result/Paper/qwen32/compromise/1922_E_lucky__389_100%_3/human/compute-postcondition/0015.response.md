Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` must be at least 8; `subseq_lens` is an empty list; `mx` is 0; `i` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
