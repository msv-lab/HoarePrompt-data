Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is at least 4, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value 59, `i` is 60, and `i` is not equal to 0. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The variable `subseq_lens` now contains the value 59 (which is `i - 1`), while all other variables retain their initial values and conditions. The program has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement as stated.
