The loop condition is `2 ** i <= x`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the values of `i` and `x` such that `2 ** i` is still less than or equal to `x`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000 (this does not affect the loop condition, so it remains unchanged).
- For each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18 (this also does not affect the loop condition directly, so it remains unchanged).
- `x` must be at least 4 (this affects the loop condition).
- `subseq_lens` is an empty list (this does not affect the loop condition, so it remains unchanged).
- `mx` is 0 (this does not affect the loop condition, so it remains unchanged).
- `i` is 2 (this affects the loop condition).

Currently, `i` is 2, so `2 ** i` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be at least 4 (which is already satisfied), and `2 ** (i + 1)` must be less than or equal to `x`. This means `2 ** 3` (which is 8) must be less than or equal to `x`.

Therefore, `x` must be at least 8 for the loop to execute one more time. We do not need to adjust `t`, `X`, `subseq_lens`, or `mx` because they do not affect the loop condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` must be at least 8; `subseq_lens` is an empty list; `mx` is 0; `i` is 2**
