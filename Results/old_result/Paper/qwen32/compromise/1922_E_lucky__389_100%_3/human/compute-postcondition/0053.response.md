Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is at least 4 minus 2^59, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value 59, `i` is 60, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms, `x` has been decremented by `2^59`, while all other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
