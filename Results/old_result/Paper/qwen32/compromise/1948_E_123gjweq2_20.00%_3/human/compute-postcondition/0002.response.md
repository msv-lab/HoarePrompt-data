The code calculates the value of `mid` as the integer division of the difference between `big_element` and `small_element` by 2. Given the initial state, `small_element` is `left + 1` and `big_element` is `right + 1`. Therefore, `mid` becomes `(right + 1 - (left + 1)) // 2`, which simplifies to `(right - left) // 2`.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr), `clique` is an integer representing the current clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, and `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.**
