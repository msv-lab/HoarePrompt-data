In the given task, the for loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(not_mid):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i` and the variable `not_mid` which determines the range of the loop. The loop will execute if `not_mid` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is the loop index and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts, as it will be initialized to 0 by the `range` function.

The state before the loop starts is provided as:
- `arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` are set to `small_element`, `small_element + 1`, ..., `small_element + mid - 1` respectively.
- `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all set to `clique`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Since the loop's execution depends on `not_mid`, we need to ensure that `not_mid` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The state of `arr` and `cliquess` are not relevant to the execution of this specific for loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `not_mid` is greater than 0.

State: **`arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` are set to `small_element`, `small_element + 1`, ..., `small_element + mid - 1` respectively; `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all set to `clique`; `not_mid` must be greater than 0**.
