The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a rectangle's dimensions and two distinct points within it. For each test case, it determines and prints the result of a game between Alice and Bob, based on the coordinates of the points and the rectangle's dimensions. The result can be "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw".
