You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a rectangle's dimensions and two distinct points within it. For each test case, it determines and prints the result of a game between Alice and Bob, based on the coordinates of the points and the rectangle's dimensions. The result can be "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and the logic it uses.

The code uses the following logic:
1. If Alice's row (`a`) is greater than Bob's row (`c`), it immediately prints "Draw".
2. If Alice's row is not greater than Bob's row, it calculates `x` as half the distance between Alice's and Bob's rows.
3. If the distance between Alice's and Bob's rows is odd, it calculates the range `[l, r]` where Bob can move to in the next turn and checks if Alice can move into this range in her next turn. If yes, it prints "Alice"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".
4. If the distance between Alice's and Bob's rows is even, it calculates the range `[l, r]` where Alice can move to in the next turn and checks if Bob can move into this range in his next turn. If yes, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".

However, there are several issues with this logic:
- The immediate "Draw" when `a > c` is incorrect. Alice can still win or force a draw depending on the column positions and the board dimensions.
- The calculations for `l` and `r` do not correctly account for the boundaries of the board.
- The conditions for determining the winner or a draw are not correctly implemented.

Let's consider a specific case where the code fails:
- Suppose the board is 3x3, Alice is at (1, 1), and Bob is at (3, 3).
- The code will incorrectly print "Draw" because `a < c`, but Alice can move to (2, 2) on her first turn, and then Bob will be forced to move to (2, 2) on his turn, resulting in Alice's win.

Thus, the program does not correctly determine the outcome of the game for all potential cases, making it incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
