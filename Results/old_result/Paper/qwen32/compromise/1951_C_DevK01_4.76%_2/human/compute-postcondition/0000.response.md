The provided code snippet only reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer is likely representing the number of test cases, but the rest of the input (which includes `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `a`) has not been processed yet. Therefore, only `t` has been updated, and the other variables remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer; Each test case contains three integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9)) representing the number of sale days, the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, and the number of tickets to be bought at the end, respectively. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
