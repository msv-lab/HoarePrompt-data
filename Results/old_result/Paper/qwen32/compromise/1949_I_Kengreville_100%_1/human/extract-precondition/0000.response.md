Precondition: **i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the number of disks. The variables x, y, and r are lists of length n, where x[i] and y[i] are the integer coordinates of the center of the i-th disk, and r[i] is the positive integer radius of the i-th disk. The variables visited, coef, and bipartite are lists or variables used to track the state during the depth-first search (DFS) traversal.**
