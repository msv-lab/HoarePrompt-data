Functionality: **The function reads input values, performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal on a graph constructed from the input data, and prints 'YES' if the graph is bipartite with a non-zero total, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function modifies the `visited` and `coef` lists during the traversal but does not return any value explicitly.**
