The code snippet `x = [None] * n` reassigns the list `x` to a new list of `n` elements, all initialized to `None`. This means the previous contents of `x` are discarded, and `x` now holds `n` `None` values. The other variables (`y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `x` is a list of `n` None values, `y` is a list of integers where each element satisfies -10^9 <= y[i] <= 10^9, `r` is a list of integers where each element satisfies 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9, `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to False, and `coef` is a list of None values that will be used to store coefficients during the DFS traversal.**
