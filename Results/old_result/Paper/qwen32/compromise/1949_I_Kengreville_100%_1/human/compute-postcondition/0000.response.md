The code snippet `n = int(input())` takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` was an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), but after the execution of the code, `n` will be the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables (`x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `x` and `y` are lists of integers where each element satisfies -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9, `r` is a list of integers where each element satisfies 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9, `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to False, and `coef` is a list of None values that will be used to store coefficients during the DFS traversal.**
