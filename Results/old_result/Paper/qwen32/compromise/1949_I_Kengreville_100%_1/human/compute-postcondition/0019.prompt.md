You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, x and y are lists of integers where each element satisfies -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9, r is a list of integers where each element satisfies 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9, visited is a list of boolean values initialized to False, and coef is a list of None values that will be used to store coefficients during the DFS traversal.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef = [None] * n
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `n` False values, and `coef` is a list of `n` None values.
    tot = 0
    bipartite = True
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef[i] = 1
            tot = 0
            bipartite = True
            dfs(i)
            ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0
        
    #State: `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values (some of which may be `True` after the loop), `coef` is a list of `n` integers (some of which may be `1` after the loop), `tot` is an integer (potentially modified by the loop), `bipartite` is a boolean (potentially modified by the loop), and `ok` is a boolean (potentially `True` if a bipartite condition with non-zero `tot` is met during the loop).
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values (some of which may be `True` after the loop), `coef` is a list of `n` integers (some of which may be `1` after the loop), `tot` is an integer (potentially modified by the loop), `bipartite` is a boolean (potentially modified by the loop), and `ok` is a boolean. If `ok` is `True`, the current value of `ok` remains `True`. If `ok` is `False`, the value of `ok` remains `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly but operates on the following global variables: `n` (an integer between 1 and 1000), `x` and `y` (lists of integers where each element is between -10^9 and 10^9), `r` (a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9), `visited` (a list of boolean values initialized to False), and `coef` (a list of None values used to store coefficients during a DFS traversal). The function performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal using these variables and modifies the `visited` and `coef` lists accordingly. The function does not return any value explicitly.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
