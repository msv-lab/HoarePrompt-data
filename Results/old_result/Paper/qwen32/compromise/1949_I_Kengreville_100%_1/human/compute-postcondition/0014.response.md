The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides a detailed description of various variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, `ok`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string provided in the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
2. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.
3. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state are referenced in the `print` statement, so their values do not affect the output.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
