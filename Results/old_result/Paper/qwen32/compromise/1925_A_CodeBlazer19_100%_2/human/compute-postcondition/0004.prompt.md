You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives no direct input parameters. Instead, it reads from standard input where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 676) denoting the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 26) representing the length of the strings to be formed and the number of first lowercase English alphabets to be used, respectively.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)
        
    #State: The variable `i` will have the value `t-1` after the loop completes, as it will have iterated through all values from `0` to `t-1`. The variables `n` and `k` will hold the values from the last test case input. The string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n will have been printed `t` times, each corresponding to the inputs of each test case. The initial value of `t` will remain unchanged as it is only used to control the loop iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads from standard input where the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 676) denoting the number of test cases. Each of the following `t` lines contains two integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 26) representing the length of the strings to be formed and the number of first lowercase English alphabets to be used, respectively. The function returns the number of distinct strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
