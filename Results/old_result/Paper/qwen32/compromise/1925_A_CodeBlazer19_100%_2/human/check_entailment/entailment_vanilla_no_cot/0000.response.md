Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program simply repeats the first k lowercase letters n times, which does not guarantee that all possible subsequences of length n are present in the string. 

For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `k = 2`. The correct output should be a string that contains all subsequences "aa", "ab", "ba", and "bb". The program's output for this test case would be "abab", which does not contain "ba" as a subsequence.

To solve the problem correctly, one approach is to generate a de Bruijn sequence for the alphabet of size k and length n. A de Bruijn sequence for a given alphabet size k and length n is a cyclic sequence in which every possible string of length n appears exactly once as a substring. For this problem, we need to convert the cyclic sequence to a linear sequence by repeating the first n-1 characters at the end. 

Here is a corrected version of the program that generates the required string using a de Bruijn sequence:

```python
def de_bruijn(k, n):
    a = [0] * k * n
    sequence = []

    def db(t, p):
        if t > n:
            if n % p == 0:
                for j in range(1, p + 1):
                    sequence.append(a[j])
        else:
            a[t] = a[t - p]
            db(t + 1, p)
            for j in range(a[t - p] + 1, k):
                a[t] = j
                db(t + 1, t)

    db(1, 1)
    return sequence

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        seq = de_bruijn(k, n)
        result = ''.join(chr(x + ord('a')) for x in seq) + ''.join(chr(x + ord('a')) for x in seq[:n-1])
        print(result)

func()
```

This program correctly generates the required string for each test case.
