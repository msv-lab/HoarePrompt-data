The code snippet `n = len(array)` assigns the length of the list `array` to the variable `n`. The length of `array` is the number of integers in the permutation, which is given to be between 1 and \(2 \cdot 10^5\). The variable `find` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. The list `array` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length \(n\) (1 ≤ \(n\) ≤ \(2 \cdot 10^5\)) containing distinct integers from 1 to \(n\), and `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ \(n\)) that needs to be found in the permutation; `n` is the length of `array`.**
