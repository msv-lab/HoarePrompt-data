To determine the exact output of the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the values of the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`lft`**: This list remains sorted and unchanged.
2. **`ldb`**: This list contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element.
3. **`sng`**: This list contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, and `sng` must have at least 2 elements.
4. **`sz`**: This is calculated as the minimum of `2 * len(ldb)` or `k + 1`. The value of `k` is not provided, but it's mentioned that if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
5. **`elem`**: This is defined as the second element in `sng`.

### Analysis:
- Since `sng` must have at least 2 elements, the second element (`elem`) is well-defined.
- The exact values of `lft`, `ldb`, and `sng` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `elem`. However, we know that `elem` is the second element in the list `sng`.

### Output:
Given the above analysis, the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the second element of the list `sng`, followed by a space.

Output: **elem (where elem is the second element in the list `sng`)**
