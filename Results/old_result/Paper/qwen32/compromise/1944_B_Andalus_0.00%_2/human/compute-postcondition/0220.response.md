Postcondition: **`rdb` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the next element from `rdb`. If `k - sz >= 2`, `sz` is incremented by 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to `rdb` or `elem`.**
