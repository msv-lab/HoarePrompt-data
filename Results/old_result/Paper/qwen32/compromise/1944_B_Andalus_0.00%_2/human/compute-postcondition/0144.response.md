The code snippet `ldb.append(lft[i])` appends the value of `lft[i]` to the list `ldb`. This means that the list `ldb` will have an additional element, which is `lft[i]`.

Given the initial state, `lft` is a list, `i` is `i + 2`, and `n` remains the same. The conditions about `ldb` and `sng` are not directly relevant to the execution of this specific line of code, as they pertain to different scenarios based on the values in `lft`. 

The only change in the output state is that `ldb` now includes `lft[i]` as an additional element.

Output State: **`lft` is a list, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` remains the same, `ldb` has an additional element which is `lft[i]`.**
