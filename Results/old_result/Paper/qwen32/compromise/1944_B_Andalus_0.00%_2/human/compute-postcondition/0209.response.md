The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem` and the iterable `rdb`. Since the loop iterates over `rdb`, we need to adjust the state of `elem` and ensure that `rdb` still contains elements for the loop to continue.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `lft` remains sorted and unchanged.
- `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element.
- `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors.
- `rdb` must contain at least one element.
- If `k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is now `sz + 2` (where `sz + 2` is greater than or equal to `k + 2` or `2` if `sz` was initially less than `k`). Otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged.

Since the loop is about to start the next iteration, `elem` will take the next value from `rdb`. The state of `lft`, `ldb`, `sng`, and `sz` does not directly affect the loop's continuation, only `rdb` does.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `rdb` must still contain at least one element. Since `elem` is the loop variable and takes the next value from `rdb` in each iteration, we need to ensure that `rdb` has at least one element left.

State: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, `rdb` must contain at least one element, `sz` is adjusted based on the condition `k - sz >= 2` as described, `elem` is the next element from `rdb`**.

However, since we are only adjusting states of objects in the loop head, the final state we need to specify is:
State: **`rdb` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the next element from `rdb`**.
