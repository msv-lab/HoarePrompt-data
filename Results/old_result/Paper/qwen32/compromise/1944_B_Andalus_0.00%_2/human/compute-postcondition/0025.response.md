The code snippet `ldb.append(lft[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lft` to the list `ldb`. The other variables remain unchanged unless their values depend on `i` or the contents of `ldb`.

Given the initial state, `i` is incremented by 1 before the line of code is executed, so the element `lft[i]` is appended to `ldb`. The conditions for `sng` and `rdb` are not directly affected by this single line of code, so their states remain as they were before this line, pending the next iteration or condition check.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `i` is incremented by 1, `ldb` contains the element `lft[i]` appended to it, `rdb`, and `sng` are determined based on the new value of `i` as per the loop logic. If `i < n - 1` and `lft[i] != lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` includes the element `lft[i]` which was appended to it.**
