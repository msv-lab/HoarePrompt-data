The code snippet provided increments the variable `sz` by 2. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Since the code does not alter the values of `t`, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, `sng`, or `elem`, these variables retain their initial values. The only change is in the value of `sz`, which is increased by 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them and must have at least two elements, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are unique and not at the boundaries, `elem` is the third element in `ldb`, `sz` is increased by 2.**
