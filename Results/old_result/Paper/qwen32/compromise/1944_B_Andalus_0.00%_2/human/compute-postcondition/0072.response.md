To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(elem, end=' ')`, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the context in which `elem` is defined and used.

### Given Initial State:
1. `t` and `T` are integers within the range 1 to 5000.
2. `n` is an integer greater than 1.
3. `k` is the second integer from the input.
4. `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
5. `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
6. `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`, sorted in ascending order.
7. `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them.
8. `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately preceding them.
9. `sng` contains at least two elements that are unique and not at the boundaries in `lft`.
10. `sz` is the maximum value less than or equal to `k` that is a multiple of 2, or the number of elements in `ldb` multiplied by 2, whichever is smaller, incremented by 1.
11. If `sz` (incremented by 1) is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
12. `elem` is the next element in `sng` after the previously processed element.

### Analysis:
- `sng` contains unique elements that are not at the boundaries in `lft`. This means `sng` contains elements from `lft` that are not the first or last element and are unique.
- `elem` is defined as the next element in `sng` after the previously processed element. This implies that `elem` is an element from the `sng` list.

### Output:
The statement `print(elem, end=' ')` will print the current value of `elem` followed by a space. Since `elem` is an element from the `sng` list, which contains unique elements from `lft`, the output will be one of those unique elements.

### Final Output:
Output: **elem (where elem is the next element in the `sng` list after the previously processed element)**

This output reflects the value of `elem` based on the given initial state and the context in which it is used.
