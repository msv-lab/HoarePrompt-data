Postcondition: **`sz` is either 0, 2, or 4, all elements in `sng` up to the initial value of `sz` have been printed, `rdb` must have more than one element, and if `sz` is 4, then `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2. If `sz` is not greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is not broken out of. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
