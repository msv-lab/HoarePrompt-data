The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that. According to the loop statement `for i in range(1, n)`, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 5.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are unique and not at the boundaries, and `i` is 5. If `rgt[5]` is equal to `rgt[4]`, then `rdb` contains `rgt[5]`.**
