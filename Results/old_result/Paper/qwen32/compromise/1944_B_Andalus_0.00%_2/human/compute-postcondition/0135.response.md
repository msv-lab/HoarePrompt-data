The code snippet `sng.append(lft[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `lft` to the end of the list `sng`. 

Given the initial state, the value of `lft[i]` is not specified, but it is known that `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. The other conditions about `i` and the list `lft` remain unchanged.

The only change is that the list `sng` now includes the element `lft[i]` at the end of it.

Output State: **`lft` is a list, `i` is an index such that `i` is greater than 0, `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `i` is less than `n - 1`, and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]; sng` includes `lft[i]` at the end.**
