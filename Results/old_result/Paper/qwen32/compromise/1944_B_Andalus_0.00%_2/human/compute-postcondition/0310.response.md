To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`lst`**: This is the original list of integers provided as input.
2. **`n` and `k`**: These are values provided by the input.
3. **`lft`**: This is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
4. **`ldb`**: This contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately before them.
5. **`sng`**: This contains all elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them and must have at least one element.
6. **`rgt`**: This is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order.
7. **`rdb`**: This contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately before them.
8. **`sz`**: This is the smallest multiple of 2 that is equal to or greater than `k` plus 1.
9. **`elem`**: This is the next element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Sorting and Splitting**:
   - `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
   - `rgt` is the remaining elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.

2. **Identifying Elements**:
   - `ldb` contains elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately before them.
   - `sng` contains elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them. It must have at least one element.
   - `rdb` contains elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately before them.

3. **Determining `sz`**:
   - `sz` is calculated as the smallest multiple of 2 that is equal to or greater than `k` plus 1.

4. **Determining `elem`**:
   - `elem` is the next element in `sng`.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Conclusion

The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the next element in `sng`, which is the next element in the list `lft` that does not have duplicates immediately before or after it.

Given the initial state, the exact value of `elem` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `lst`, `n`, and `k`. However, based on the structure of the problem, `elem` will be the next element in `sng`.

Output: **elem (where elem is the next element in the list `sng`, which contains elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them)**
