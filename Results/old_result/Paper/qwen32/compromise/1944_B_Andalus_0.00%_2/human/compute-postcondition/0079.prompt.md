Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are unique and not at the boundaries, and `sz` is the maximum value less than or equal to `k` that is a multiple of 2, or the number of elements in `ldb` multiplied by 2, whichever is smaller.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `sng` contains at least one element that is unique and not at the boundaries in `lft`, and `sz` is the maximum value less than or equal to `k` that is a multiple of 2, or the number of elements in `ldb` multiplied by 2, whichever is smaller, incremented by 1. If `sz` (incremented by 1) is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `sng` contains at least two elements that are unique and not at the boundaries in `lft`, `sz` is the maximum value less than or equal to `k` that is a multiple of 2, or the number of elements in `ldb` multiplied by 2, whichever is smaller, incremented by 2, `elem` is the next element in `sng` after the previously processed element. If `sz` (incremented by 1) is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `sng` contains at least two elements that are unique and not at the boundaries in `lft`, `sz` is the previous `sz` value plus 1, `elem` is the next element in `sng` after the previously processed element. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes occur based on the given else part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
