To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

Here's the breakdown of the information provided:
- `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
- `ldb` must contain at least one element that has a duplicate immediately before it.
- `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them.
- `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately before them.
- `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input.
- `lst` is a list of integers from the input.
- `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order.
- `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.

However, the variable `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since `elem` is not provided, it is not possible to determine its exact value based on the given information. Therefore, we can only describe it in terms of its role or potential value.

Given that the print statement is `print(elem, elem, end=' ')`, it will print the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, and without a newline at the end.

Since the value of `elem` is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `elem`.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is an element that is not explicitly defined in the given initial state)**
