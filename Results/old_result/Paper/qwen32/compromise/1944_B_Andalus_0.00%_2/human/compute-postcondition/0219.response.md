The value of `sz` is incremented by 2. The values of `rdb`, `elem`, and the condition regarding `sz` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rdb` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the next element from `rdb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to `rdb` or `elem`. `sz` is incremented by 2.**
