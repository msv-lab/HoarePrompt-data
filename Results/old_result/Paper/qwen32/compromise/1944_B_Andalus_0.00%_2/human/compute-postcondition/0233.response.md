The only variable in the loop head is `elem`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the `sng` list. If `sng` contains at least one more element, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sng` contains at least one more unique element in `lft` that is not the same as its immediate neighbors.

Since the loop iterates over each element in `sng`, at the start of the next iteration, `elem` will be the next element in `sng`.

State: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element, `sng` contains at least one more unique element in `lft` that is not the same as its immediate neighbors, `rdb` remains unchanged, and `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. `elem` is the next element in `sng`**
