To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State:
- `rdb` must not be empty.
- `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `sz` is less than `k`.

Code snippet:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `rdb` is a list and it is not empty.
- `k` and `sz` are integers such that `k - sz >= 2` and `sz < k`.

However, there is no information provided about the variable `elem`. The variable `elem` is not defined or initialized in the given initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `elem` based on the provided information.

Given this, the most precise description we can provide is that the print statement will output the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space, without knowing the specific value of `elem`.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the value of the variable elem)**
