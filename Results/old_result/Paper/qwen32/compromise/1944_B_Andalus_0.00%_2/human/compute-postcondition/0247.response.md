The code snippet `lft.sort()` sorts the list `lft` in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order; `ldb` is an empty list; `sng` is an empty list; `rdb` is an empty list; `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus the number of elements printed from `sng`; `n` and `k` are assigned the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers from the input; `rgt` is `lst[n:]`.**
