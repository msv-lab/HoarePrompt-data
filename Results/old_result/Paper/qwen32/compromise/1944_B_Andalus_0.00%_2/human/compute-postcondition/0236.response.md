Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`lft`**: A sorted list that remains unchanged.
2. **`ldb`**: A list containing all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element.
3. **`sng`**: A list containing at least one more unique element in `lft` that is not the same as its immediate neighbors.
4. **`rdb`**: A list that remains unchanged.
5. **`sz`**: The largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
6. **`elem`**: The next element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Explanation:
- **`elem`**: This variable holds the next element from the list `sng`. Since `sng` contains unique elements that are not the same as their immediate neighbors in `lft`, `elem` will be one of these unique elements.
- **`end=' '`**: This argument in the `print` function specifies that a space should be printed after the value of `elem`, instead of the default newline character.

### Output:
Since `elem` is the next element in the list `sng`, and `sng` contains unique elements from `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors, the printed value will be one of these unique elements.

Output: **elem (where elem is the next unique element in the list `sng` that is not the same as its immediate neighbors in `lft`)**
