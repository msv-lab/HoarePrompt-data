Postcondition: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element and must have at least 2 elements, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is 2. Otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
