The code snippet `ldb.append(lft[i])` appends the element at index `i` of `lft` to the list `ldb`. Given that `i` is 5, the element `lft[5]` is appended to `ldb`.

Let's break down the impact on the variables:
- `ldb` was initially a list containing `lft[4]` if `lft[4]` is equal to `lft[3]`, otherwise it was an empty list. After the execution, `ldb` will contain the element `lft[4]` (if it was already there) and `lft[5]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order; `ldb` is a list containing `lft[4]` and `lft[5]` if `lft[4]` is equal to `lft[3]`, otherwise it contains only `lft[5]`; `sng` is a list containing `lft[i]` if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. Additionally, `sng` contains `lft[4]` if `lft[4]` is not equal to `lft[5]`; `rdb` is an empty list; `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus the number of elements printed from `sng`; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is assigned the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers from the input; `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order; `i` is 5.**
