The code snippet `sz += 1` increments the value of `sz` by 1. The other variables (`lft`, `ldb`, `sng`, `elem`, and the condition related to `k`) remain unchanged. 

Since `sz` is incremented, the new value of `sz` will be the previous value of `sz` plus 1. The condition `if sz >= k` will be re-evaluated with the new value of `sz`.

Output State: **`lft` remains sorted and unchanged, `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element, `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors and must have at least 3 elements, `sz` is the minimum of `2 * len(ldb)` or `k` plus 2, incremented by 1, `elem` is the third element in `sng`. If the new `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change occurs in the variables.**
