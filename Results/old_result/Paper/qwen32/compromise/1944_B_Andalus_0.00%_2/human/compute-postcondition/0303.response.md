Output State: **`lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order; `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately before them; `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them and must have at least 1 element; `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately before them; `n` and `k` are assigned the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers from the input; `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order; `sz` is the smallest multiple of 2 that is equal to or greater than `k`, and `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
