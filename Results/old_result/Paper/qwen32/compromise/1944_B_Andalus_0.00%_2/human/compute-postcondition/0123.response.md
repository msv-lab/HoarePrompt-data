The code snippet `lft = lst[:n]` creates a new list `lft` that contains the first `n` elements of the list `lst`. The values of `sng`, `sz`, `T`, `n`, `k`, and `lst` remain unchanged.

Output State: **All elements of `sng` up to the index `min(k, len(sng)) - 1` are printed, `sz` is equal to `min(k, len(sng))`, `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.**
