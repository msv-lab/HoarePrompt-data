To determine the final output state after the loop has completed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables involved.

The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (exclusive), and for each iteration `i`, it checks if the current element in `rgt` (i.e., `rgt[i]`) is equal to the previous element in `rgt` (i.e., `rgt[i - 1]`). If they are equal, it appends `rgt[i]` to the list `rdb`.

After the loop finishes, `i` will have taken on all values from 1 to `n-1`. The list `rdb` will contain all elements from `rgt` that have duplicates immediately preceding them.

Here is the final output state in the required format:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, and `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are unique and not at the boundaries.**

In natural language: After the loop finishes, the variable `rdb` will contain all elements from the list `rgt` that have duplicates immediately preceding them. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states or states after the initial setup, as they are not modified by the loop.
