The provided code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `lst`. This operation does not affect the initial values of `t`, `T`, `n`, or `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
