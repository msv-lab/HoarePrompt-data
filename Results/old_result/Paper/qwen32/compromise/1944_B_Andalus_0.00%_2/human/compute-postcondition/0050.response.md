The only variable in the loop head is `elem`, which iterates over `ldb`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state of `ldb` and how `elem` would be updated.

Given that `elem` is the current element being processed in `ldb` and `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, we need to adjust `elem` to the next element in `ldb` for the next iteration.

Since the loop body is omitted, we don't know how `ldb` might be modified inside the loop. However, for the loop to execute one more time, `ldb` must still have at least one more element after the current `elem`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately preceding them and must have at least one element, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates immediately preceding them, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are unique and not at the boundaries, `sz` is unchanged or increased by 2 depending on the condition `k - sz >= 2`, `elem` is the next element in `ldb` after the current one**.
