The code appends the element `rgt[i]` to the list `rdb`. Given that `i` is 4, `rgt[i]` specifically refers to the element at index 4 of the sorted list `rgt`.

Therefore, the list `rdb` will now include this new element. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order; `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately before them; `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them; `rdb` contains the element `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]` and now also includes `rgt[4]`; `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus the number of elements printed from `sng`; `n` is at least 2; `k` is assigned the value provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers from the input; `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order; `i` is 4**
