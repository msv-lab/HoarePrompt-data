The code snippet `rdb.append(rgt[i])` appends the element `rgt[5]` to the list `rdb`. Given that `i` is 5, the element at index 5 of the sorted list `rgt` is added to `rdb`.

Output State: **`lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order; `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates immediately before them; `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have duplicates immediately before or after them; `rdb` contains the element `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, and if `rgt[4] == rgt[3]`, `rdb` also includes `rgt[4]`, and now `rdb` also includes `rgt[5]`; `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus the number of elements printed from `sng`; `n` is at least 5; `k` is assigned the value provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers from the input; `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order; `i` is 5.**
