To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the `print` statement itself.

### Given Information:
- `lft` is a sorted list and remains unchanged.
- `ldb` contains all duplicate elements from `lft` that are immediately preceded by the same element.
- `sng` contains all unique elements in `lft` that are not the same as their immediate neighbors.
- `sz` is 0 if it was less than `k` before the if statement, otherwise `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `rdb` must contain at least one element.
- The current value of `sz` is such that `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement prints the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, and ends with a space instead of a newline (due to `end=' '`).

However, the initial state provided does not explicitly define what `elem` is. Given the context and the variables mentioned, `elem` could potentially be an element from `lft`, `ldb`, `sng`, or `rdb`. Since there's no specific information about `elem`'s value in the initial state, we can only describe `elem` in terms of the sets it could belong to.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact value of `elem` is not provided, we can describe the output in terms of what `elem` could be based on the given sets.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is an element from lft, ldb, sng, or rdb)**
