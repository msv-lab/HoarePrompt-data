The code snippet appends the value of `lft[i]` to the list `ldb`. Given that `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, the value being appended to `ldb` is the same as the value at index `i` (or `i-1`) in `lft`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`; `lft` is a list; `i` is an index such that `i` is greater than 0, and the elements at index `i` and `i-1` in the list `lft` have the same value; `ldb` has an additional element which is the value of `lft[i]`.**
