You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, and two lists `p` and `a`. For each test case, it determines the maximum possible score that two players, Bodya and Sasha, can achieve within `k` steps based on the values in `p` and `a`, starting from positions `P_B` and `P_S` respectively. It then prints 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is higher, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is higher, or 'Draw' if their scores are equal.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps` (the length of the permutation, the number of turns, Bodya's starting position, and Sasha's starting position).
   - It reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Path Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the path for Bodya and Sasha separately.
   - It uses a list `vis` to track visited positions to detect cycles.
   - The path is stored in `pathb` for Bodya and `paths` for Sasha.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - For each path (Bodya's and Sasha's), it calculates the maximum possible score considering the number of turns `k`.
   - The score is calculated by summing up the values of `a` at the positions in the path, taking into account the number of turns remaining.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - It compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, and "Draw" if the scores are equal.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Cycle Handling:** The program correctly detects cycles using the `vis` list but does not handle the cycle part of the problem effectively.
- **Score Calculation:** The program calculates the score for each path considering the number of turns but does not account for the possibility of staying on the same position after entering a cycle.
- **Optimization:** The program does not optimize the calculation of scores for cycles, which is crucial given the constraints (especially `k` up to \(10^9\)).

### Correctness:
The program has a fundamental issue in how it calculates the score when players enter a cycle. It should handle the cycle by calculating the sum of the cycle and determining how many full cycles can be completed within `k` turns, along with any remaining turns.

Given the issues identified, the program is not fully correct according to the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
