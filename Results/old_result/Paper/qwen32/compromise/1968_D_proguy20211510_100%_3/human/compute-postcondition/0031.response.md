Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is an integer that points to an index already visited; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing the integers `a[pb - 1]` from the start until a cycle is detected; `paths` is a list containing the integer `a[ps - 1]`; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where `vis[ps - 1]` is 1 and all other elements are 0.**

In this output state, the list `paths` has been updated to include the integer `a[ps - 1]`. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
