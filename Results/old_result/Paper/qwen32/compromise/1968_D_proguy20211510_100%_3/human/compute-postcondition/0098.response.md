The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. Since the loop is controlled by the number of iterations specified by `int(input())`, the state of the loop head does not change in a way that we can directly adjust. However, we need to consider the state of the variables that influence the next iteration of the loop, which in this case is the input itself.

Given that the loop runs for a number of iterations specified by the input, and there are no variables in the loop head that we can adjust directly, the state of the program at the start of the next iteration will be determined by the next input value.

Therefore, the state of the program at the start of the next iteration will be the same as the provided state, except that the next input value will be read and used to determine the number of iterations for the next loop.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is an integer that points to an index already visited; `ps` is the index of the first repeated element in the cycle; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing the integers `a[pb - 1]` from the start until a cycle is detected; `paths` is a list containing the integers from `a[initial ps - 1]` to `a[ps - 1]` until the cycle is detected; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where `vis[ps - 1]` is 1 and all other elements are 0; `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `min(len(pathb), k) - 1`; `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `min(len(paths), k) - 1`; `preb` is the sum of the first `min(len(pathb), k)` elements of `pathb`; `pres` is the sum of the first `min(len(paths), k)` elements of `paths`; `i` is `min(len(paths), k)`. The final result is `resb` if `resb` is greater than `ress`, otherwise it is `ress`.**
