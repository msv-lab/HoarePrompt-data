Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `pathb` is an empty list; `paths` is an empty list; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0.**

In natural language, this means that the variable `vis` has been created and initialized as a list containing `n` zeros. All other variables retain their initial values.
