The code snippet `paths.append(a[ps - 1])` adds the value `a[ps - 1]` to the end of the list `paths`. This means that the length of `paths` increases by 1, and the new last element of `paths` is `a[ps - 1]`.

Given the initial state, the variables `vis`, `preb`, `resb`, `ress`, `pres`, `i`, and `ps` remain unchanged because the code snippet only modifies `paths`. The variable `paths` now includes an additional element, `a[ps - 1]`, at the end.

Output State: **`pathb` contains values from `a` corresponding to the nodes visited before the cycle, `pb` is the node that completes the cycle, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` and `ress` are the maximum values of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `pres` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `paths`, `i` is the smaller of `len(paths)` and `k`, `paths` now includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]` at the end, and `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`. Additionally, if `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
