The value of `curr` is updated to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`. The condition `if k < i + 1` and the associated break statement are not affected by the assignment to `curr`. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`. If `k < i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`**.
