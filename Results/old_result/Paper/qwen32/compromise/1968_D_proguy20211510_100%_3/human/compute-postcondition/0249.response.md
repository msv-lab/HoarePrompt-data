Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no action is taken. `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`**.

In this output state, the value of `curr` is calculated as `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`. The conditions regarding `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
