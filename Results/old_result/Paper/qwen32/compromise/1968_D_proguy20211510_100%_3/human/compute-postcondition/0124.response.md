The code snippet `vis[ps - 1] = 1` sets the value at the index `ps - 1` of the list `vis` to 1. This means that the element at the position corresponding to `ps` (considering 1-based indexing) in the `vis` list is now marked as visited.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the integer value from input; `k` is the integer value from input; `pb` is the value of `p[pb - 1]` when the loop terminates (i.e., the repeated node); `ps` is the integer value from input; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a new list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node; `paths` is an empty list; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1; `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `min(len(pathb), k) - 1`; `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `min(len(paths), k) - 1`; `preb` is the sum of the first `min(len(pathb), k)` elements of `pathb`; `pres` is the sum of the first `min(len(paths), k)` elements of `paths`; `i` is `min(len(paths), k)`**.
