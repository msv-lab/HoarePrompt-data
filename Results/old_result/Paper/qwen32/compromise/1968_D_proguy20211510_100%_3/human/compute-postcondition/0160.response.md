Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `k` are integer values from input; `pb` is the value of `p[pb - 1]` when the loop terminates; `ps` is the repeated node; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a new list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node and must have at least one element; `paths` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node, including the repeated node; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except the indices corresponding to visited nodes which are 1; `resb` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr`; `ress` is 0; `preb` is `preb + pathb[i]`; `pres` is 0; `i` is `i + 1` if `i + 1 < len(pathb)`; `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`. If `k < i + 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as described without breaking out of the loop.**

The value of `curr` has been updated to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`. All other variables retain their previous values and states.
