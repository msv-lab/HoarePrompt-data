Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `pathb` contains values from `a` corresponding to the nodes visited before the cycle, `pb` is the node that completes the cycle, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `preb` is 0, `resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `pres` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `paths`, `i` is the smaller of `len(paths)` and `k`, `paths` includes three additional elements `a[ps - 1]` from each iteration, and `ps` is the node that completes the cycle.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(pathb)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
    preb += pathb[i]
    resb = max(resb, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `pathb` contains at least one value from `a` corresponding to a node visited before the cycle, `pb` is the node that completes the cycle, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `preb` is `preb + pathb[i]`, `resb` is `max(0, pathb[i] * (k - i))`, `ress` is 0, `pres` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `paths`, `i` is the smaller of `len(paths)` and `k`, `paths` includes three additional elements `a[ps - 1]` from each iteration, `ps` is the node that completes the cycle. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues as specified by the else part, which in this case does nothing. `curr` is `pathb[i] * (k - i)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `i + 1`. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no action is taken. `preb` is `preb + pathb[i]`. `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`. `resb` is the maximum of the previous `resb` and `curr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `i + 1`. If `k < i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. `preb` is `preb + pathb[i]`. `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`. `resb` is `max(resb, curr)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
