Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is an integer that points to an index already visited; `ps` is the index of the first repeated element in the cycle; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing the integers `a[pb - 1]` from the start until a cycle is detected; `paths` is a list containing the integers from `a[initial ps - 1]` to `a[ps - 1]` until the cycle is detected; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where `vis[ps - 1]` is 1 and all other elements are 0; `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `min(len(pathb), k) - 1`; `ress` is 0; `preb` is the sum of the first `min(len(pathb), k)` elements of `pathb`; `pres` is 0; `i` is `min(len(pathb), k)`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(paths)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = pres + paths[i] * (k - i)
    pres += paths[i]
    ress = max(ress, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is an integer that points to an index already visited; `ps` is the index of the first repeated element in the cycle; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing the integers `a[pb - 1]` from the start until a cycle is detected; `paths` is a list containing the integers from `a[initial ps - 1]` to `a[ps - 1]` until the cycle is detected and must have at least 1 element; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where `vis[ps - 1]` is 1 and all other elements are 0; `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `min(len(pathb), k) - 1`; `ress` is the maximum of the previous `ress` and `curr`; `preb` is the sum of the first `min(len(pathb), k)` elements of `pathb`; `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`; `i` is `min(len(pathb), k)`; `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is an integer that points to an index already visited; `ps` is the index of the first repeated element in the cycle; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing the integers `a[pb - 1]` from the start until a cycle is detected; `paths` is a list containing the integers from `a[initial ps - 1]` to `a[ps - 1]` until the cycle is detected and must have at least 1 element; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where `vis[ps - 1]` is 1 and all other elements are 0; `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `min(len(pathb), k) - 1`; `ress` is the maximum of the previous `ress` and `curr`; `preb` is the sum of the first `min(len(pathb), k)` elements of `pathb`; `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`; `i` is `min(len(pathb), k) + 1` if `k < i + 1`, otherwise `i` remains unchanged; `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` if `k < i + 1`, otherwise `curr` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is an integer that points to an index already visited; `ps` is the index of the first repeated element in the cycle; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing the integers `a[pb - 1]` from the start until a cycle is detected; `paths` is a list containing the integers from `a[initial ps - 1]` to `a[ps - 1]` until the cycle is detected and must have at least 1 element; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where `vis[ps - 1]` is 1 and all other elements are 0; `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `min(len(pathb), k) - 1`; `ress` is the maximum of the previous `ress` and `curr`; `preb` is the sum of the first `min(len(pathb), k)` elements of `pathb`; `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`; `i` is `i + 1` (incremented by 1); and if `k < i + 1`, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `curr` remains unchanged; `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
