Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the integer value from input; `k` is the integer value from input; `pb` is the value of `p[pb - 1]` when the loop terminates (i.e., the repeated node); `ps` is the value of `p[ps - 1]`; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a new list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node; `paths` is a list containing the value `a[ps - 1]` and now has an additional element `a[ps - 1]` appended to it; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1; `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `min(len(pathb), k) - 1`; `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `min(len(paths), k) - 1`; `preb` is the sum of the first `min(len(pathb), k)` elements of `pathb`; `pres` is the sum of the first `min(len(paths), k)` elements of `paths`; `i` is `min(len(paths), k)`. The loop or if statement is broken out of because `vis[ps - 1]` equals 1.** 

Natural Language: The loop or if statement is exited because `vis[ps - 1]` is 1. All other variables retain their previous values as specified in the initial state.
