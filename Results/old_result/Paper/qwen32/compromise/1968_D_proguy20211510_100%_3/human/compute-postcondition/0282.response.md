Postcondition: **pathb remains the same, pb remains the same, vis remains the same, preb remains the same, resb remains the same, ress is the maximum curr value computed during the iterations, pres is the sum of the first min(len(paths), k) elements of paths, i is min(len(paths), k), paths remains the same, ps remains the same, and resb is less than or equal to ress**
