Output State: **`pathb` remains the same, `pb` remains the same, `vis` remains the same, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` up to the last iteration, `resb` is the maximum of the previous `resb` and `curr`, `ress` is the maximum of the previous `ress` and `curr`, `pres` remains the same, `i` is `i`, `paths` must have at least 1 element, `ps` remains the same, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, none of the variable values change except that the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other conditions and variable states remain as they were before the `break` statement was encountered.
