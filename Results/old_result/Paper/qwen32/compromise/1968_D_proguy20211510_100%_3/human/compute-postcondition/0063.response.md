Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is an integer that points to an index already visited; `ps` is the index of the first repeated element in the cycle; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing at least one integer (e.g., `pathb = [a[pb - 1]]`); `paths` is a list containing the integers from `a[initial ps - 1]` to `a[ps - 1]` until the cycle is detected; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where `vis[ps - 1]` is 1 and all other elements are 0; `resb` is `max(resb, curr)`; `ress` is 0; `preb` is `preb + pathb[i]`; `pres` is 0; `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`; `i` is incremented by 1; `i` is now `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

In simple terms, the values of all variables remain the same as they were in the initial state, except that the loop or if statement is exited due to the `break` statement.
