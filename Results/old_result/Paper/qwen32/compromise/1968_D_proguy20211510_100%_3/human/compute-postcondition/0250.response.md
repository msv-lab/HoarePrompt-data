The value of `preb` is updated to `preb + pathb[i]`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged, and the condition `k < i + 1` still determines whether the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. The value of `curr` is not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no action is taken. `preb` is `preb + pathb[i]`. `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`.**
