Postcondition: **`pathb` contains at least one value from `a` corresponding to a node visited before the cycle, `pb` is the node that completes the cycle, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `preb` is 0, `resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `pres` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `paths`, `i` is the smaller of `len(paths)` and `k`, `paths` includes three additional elements `a[ps - 1]` from each iteration, `ps` is the node that completes the cycle, and `k` is less than `i + 1`.**
