The given Python code snippet includes `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered data is written to the console immediately. However, this operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Since the code does not modify the value of `n` or introduce any new variables, the value of `n` remains unchanged. The precondition that `n` is greater than 0 still holds true after the code execution.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0**.
