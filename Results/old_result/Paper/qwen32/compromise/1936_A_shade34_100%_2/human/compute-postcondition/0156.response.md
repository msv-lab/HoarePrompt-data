Let's break down the given information and analyze the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is unchanged (its value is not specified).
- `n` must be at least 2 (its value is not specified but it is known to be at least 2).
- `mak2` is unchanged (its value is not specified).
- `pans` is unchanged (its value is not specified).
- `mak` is unchanged (its value is not specified).
- `i` is incremented by 1 (this means that `i` has some initial value, and now it is increased by 1).

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement outputs a literal question mark `'?'`.
- It then prints the value of `mak` twice.
- It then prints the value of `i` twice.

Given that the values of `mak` and `i` are not explicitly provided, we can only describe their values in terms of how they are defined or changed in the initial state.

- `mak` is described as "unchanged," so it retains whatever value it had before this point in the code.
- `i` is described as "incremented by 1," meaning if it initially had a value of `x`, it now has a value of `x + 1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] [i] [i] (where [mak] is the value of mak and [i] is the value of i incremented by 1)**
