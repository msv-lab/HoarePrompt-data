Postcondition: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `mak` is the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `i` is 0, and `s` is the new input string. If `s` is `'<'`, then `pans` is `[0]`. If `s` is `'<'` or `'='`, then `pans` is `[n - 1, 0]`. Otherwise, `pans` is an empty list.**
