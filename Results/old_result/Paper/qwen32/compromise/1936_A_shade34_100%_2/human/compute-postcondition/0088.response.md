To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `t` is unchanged.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `mak2` is unchanged.
- `pans` is unchanged.
- `mak` is unchanged.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement outputs a string starting with `'?'`.
- It then prints the value of `mak` twice.
- It then prints the value of `i` twice.

### Determining the Values:
- From the initial state, we know that `mak` remains unchanged, but we do not have an explicit value for it. Therefore, we will refer to it as `mak`.
- Similarly, `i` is incremented by 1, but we do not have an initial value for `i`. Therefore, if we denote the initial value of `i` as `i_initial`, the value of `i` after incrementing by 1 would be `i_initial + 1`.

### Output Description:
Given the above analysis, the output will be:
- `'?'` followed by the value of `mak`, then the value of `mak` again, then the value of `i` (which is `i_initial + 1`), and finally the value of `i` again (which is also `i_initial + 1`).

Thus, the output can be described as:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] [i_initial + 1] [i_initial + 1] (where mak is the unchanged value of mak and i_initial + 1 is the value of i after being incremented by 1)**
