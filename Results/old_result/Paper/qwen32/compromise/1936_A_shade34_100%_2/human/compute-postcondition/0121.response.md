The code snippet assigns a new list containing only the current value of `i` to `pans`. This means that any previous contents of `pans` are overwritten. The values of `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `mak`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `mak` is the current value of `i`, `s` is the new input string, `pans` is a list containing the current value of `i`, `i` is incremented by 1**.
