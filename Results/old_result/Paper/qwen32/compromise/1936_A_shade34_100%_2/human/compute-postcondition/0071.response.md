To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

- `t`, `n`, `mak2`, and `pans` are unchanged, meaning their values are not specified in the context of this problem.
- `mak` is defined as the index of the last element in `pans` for which the input was '>' when compared to the previous `mak` element, or 0 if no such comparison resulted in '>'.

Given this, we need to focus on the values of `mak2` and `pans[mak]` for the print statement:
```python
print('!', mak2, pans[mak])
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `mak2` is unchanged, so we don't have a specific value for it.
- `mak` is the index in `pans` where the last '>' comparison occurred, or 0 if no such comparison happened.
- `pans[mak]` refers to the element in the list `pans` at the index `mak`.

Since the exact values of `mak2` and the elements in `pans` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **! [mak2] [pans[mak]] (where mak2 is unchanged and pans[mak] is the element in the list pans at the index mak, which is the index of the last element in pans for which the input was '>' when compared to the previous mak element, or 0 if no such comparison resulted in '>')**
