The value of `mak` is assigned the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `s` is the string input by the user; `mak` is equal to `i`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`; `s` is the string input by the user; `mak` is equal to `i`.**
