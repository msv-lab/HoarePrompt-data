To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is unchanged.
- `n` is unchanged.
- `mak2` is unchanged.
- `pans` is a list with at least two elements.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement outputs a question mark (`?`) followed by four elements from the list `pans`.
- The elements being printed are `pans[mak]`, `pans[mak]`, `pans[i]`, and `pans[i]`.

### Key Points:
- `mak` is not explicitly mentioned as being changed or defined in the initial state, so it retains its value from wherever it was set previously.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, meaning its value depends on the loop or sequence in which this code is running.
- `pans` is a list with at least two elements, so `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]` are valid accesses to elements in the list as long as `mak` and `i` are within the bounds of the list.

### Output Description:
- The first element printed is a literal question mark (`?`).
- The next two elements printed are both `pans[mak]`.
- The last two elements printed are both `pans[i]`.

Given the lack of specific values for `mak` and `i`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where mak is an index into the list pans and i is an index into the list pans incremented by 1 from its previous value)**
