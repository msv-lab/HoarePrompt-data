The code assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. Given that `i` is 1, `mak` will now also be 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `mak` is 1, `i` is 1, `s` is the new input string, and `pans` is `[0]` if `s` is `'<'`, `[n - 1, 0]` if `s` is `'<'` or `'='`, otherwise `pans` is an empty list.**
