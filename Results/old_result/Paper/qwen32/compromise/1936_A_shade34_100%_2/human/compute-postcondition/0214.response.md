The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `mak` will now be 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, `pans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `mak` is 1, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was either `'<'` or `'='` and must have at least `n+1` elements, `i` is 1**.
