To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than `i + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Literal String**: The first argument to the `print` function is a literal string `'?'`. This means it will be printed exactly as it is.
2. **Variables**: The remaining arguments are variables `mak`, `mak2`, and `i`. However, their values are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine their exact values based on the given information.

Given the lack of specific values for `mak`, `mak2`, and `i`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Output Description:
The `print` statement will output the literal string `'?'` followed by the values of the variables `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` again.

Output: **? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] (where [mak], [mak2], and [i] are the values of the variables mak, mak2, and i respectively)**
