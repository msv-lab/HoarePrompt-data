To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state provided:

- `t` is unchanged, but its value is not specified.
- `n` must be at least 2, but its exact value is not specified.
- `mak2` is unchanged, but its value is not specified.
- `mak` is explicitly set to 0.
- `pans` is unchanged, but its value is not specified.
- The variable `i` is not mentioned in the initial state, so its value is unknown.

Given this information, we know the following:
- `mak` is 0.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `mak2`, and `pans` are not relevant to the print statement.
- The variable `i` is used twice in the print statement, but its value is not provided.

Since `mak` is explicitly set to 0 and `i` is not defined in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of the known values and the unknown variable `i`.

Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is an undefined variable)**
