The code snippet `pans.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `pans`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, and `pans` is either `[n - 1]` or `[]` depending on the value of `s`.

- If `s` is `'<'` or `'='`, `pans` initially contains `[n - 1]`. After appending `i` (which is 0), `pans` becomes `[n - 1, 0]`.
- If `s` is neither `'<'` nor `'='`, `pans` initially is `[]`. After appending `i` (which is 0), `pans` becomes `[0]`.

Other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, `mak`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `pans` is `[n - 1, 0]` if `s` is `'<'` or `'='`, otherwise `pans` is `[0]`, `mak` is the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `i` is 0, and `s` is the new input string.**
