Postcondition: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `pans` is `[n - 1, 0]` if `s` is `'<'` or `'='`, otherwise `pans` is an empty list, `mak` is the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `i` is 0, and `s` is the new input string.**
