To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head: `i` and the range it iterates over (`len(pans)`).

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is unchanged.
- `n` is unchanged.
- `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such `i` exists).
- If the input was `'>'`, `mak` is `n`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0.
- `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was either `'<'` or `'='` and must have at least `n+1` elements.
- `i` is `n`.

The loop starts with `i` initialized to 1 and iterates up to but not including `len(pans)`. Since `i` is currently `n` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `i` to the next value it should take at the start of the next iteration.

### Step-by-step reasoning:
1. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`.
2. **Loop Initialization**: The loop initializes `i` to 1 at the start.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value at the start of the loop. However, since `i` is `n` at the end of the previous iteration, it means the loop has just finished iterating over all values from 1 to `n`.
4. **Adjustment**: To start the next iteration correctly, `i` should be set to the next value in the sequence, which is `n + 1`. But since the loop condition is `i in range(1, len(pans))`, `i` should be set to 1 if the loop is starting fresh, or incremented by 1 if continuing from the previous iteration.

Since the problem specifies that `i` is `n` at the end of the previous iteration, and the loop starts with `i` as 1, we need to consider the next value in the sequence which is `n + 1` if continuing, but since the loop restarts from 1, we set `i` to 1.

However, considering the loop is continuing from where it left off, the next value of `i` should be `n + 1` if `n < len(pans) - 1`.

Given the loop condition, the correct adjustment would be to set `i` to `n + 1` if `n + 1 < len(pans)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), if the input was `'>'`, `mak` is `n`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was either `'<'` or `'='` and must have at least `n+1` elements, `i` is `n + 1` if `n + 1 < len(pans)`**

Since the loop condition is `i in range(1, len(pans))` and `i` is `n` at the end of the previous iteration, the correct state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), if the input was `'>'`, `mak` is `n`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was either `'<'` or `'='` and must have at least `n+1` elements, `i` is 1**

But considering the continuation, the correct state should be:
State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), if the input was `'>'`, `mak` is `n`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was either `'<'` or `'='` and must have at least `n+1` elements, `i` is `n + 1` if `n + 1 < len(pans)`**

Since the loop restarts from 1, the correct state is:
State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), if the input was `'>'`, `mak` is `n`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was either `'<'` or `'='` and must have at least `n+1` elements, `i` is 1**

Final Answer:
State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), if the input was `'>'`, `mak` is `n`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was either `'<'` or `'='` and must have at least `n+1` elements, `i` is 1**
