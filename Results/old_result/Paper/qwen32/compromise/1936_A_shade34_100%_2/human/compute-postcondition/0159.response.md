Postcondition: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is at least 2, `mak2` is unchanged, `pans` is unchanged, `mak` is the value of `i` after incrementing, and `i` is incremented by 1. If the input is `<`, then `mak` takes the value of `i` after the first increment; otherwise, `mak` remains unchanged from its previous value.**
