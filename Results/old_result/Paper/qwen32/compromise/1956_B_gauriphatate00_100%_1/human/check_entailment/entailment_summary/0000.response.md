Reasoning:  
The problem asks for the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally, where you get a point if the card you play has already been played on the table. Given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours, the key observation is that you can only score points when you play a card that has already been played by Nene. 

The provided solution counts the number of integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly twice in your hand. This count represents the maximum number of points you can get because each pair of identical cards can contribute at most one point to your score (when you play the second card of the pair after Nene has played the first card).

The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the provided function, which indeed counts the number of integers that appear exactly twice in the list `a`. This aligns with the optimal strategy for you, as you can only score when you have a matching pair and Nene plays the first card of that pair.

Therefore, the provided solution is correct in determining the maximum number of points you can get under the assumption that Nene plays optimally.

Correctness: **True**
