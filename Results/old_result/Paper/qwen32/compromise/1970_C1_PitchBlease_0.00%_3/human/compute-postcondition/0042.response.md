Postcondition: **`queue` is not empty (if it had more than one element), `visited` contains all reachable nodes from `start`, `current` is the first element of the tuple removed from the queue, `dist` is the second element of the tuple removed from the queue. If `current` equals `target`, the program returns `dist`, which is the second element of the tuple removed from the queue. Otherwise, the program continues without returning.**
