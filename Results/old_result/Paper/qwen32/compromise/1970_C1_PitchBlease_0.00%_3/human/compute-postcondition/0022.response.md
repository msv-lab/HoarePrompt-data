The code snippet `current, dist = queue.popleft()` will remove the first element from the `queue` and unpack it into `current` and `dist`. This means that `current` will hold the first value of the tuple, and `dist` will hold the second value of the tuple. The `queue` will be modified to no longer contain the popped tuple.

Given the initial state, `queue` is a deque containing `unvisited_node`, and `visited` is a set containing all nodes reachable from `start` and does not include `unvisited_node`. After the execution of the code, `queue` will no longer contain the first tuple that was popped, and `current` and `dist` will hold the values from that tuple.

Output State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree, `queue` is a deque not containing the first `unvisited_node` tuple that was popped, `visited` is a set containing all nodes reachable from `start` and does not include `unvisited_node`, `current` is the first value of the popped tuple from `queue`, and `dist` is the second value of the popped tuple from `queue`.**
