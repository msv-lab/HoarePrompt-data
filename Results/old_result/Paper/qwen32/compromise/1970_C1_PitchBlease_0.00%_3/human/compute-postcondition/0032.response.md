The code snippet appends a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. This means that `queue` now includes the new tuple with `neighbor` as the first element and `dist + 1` as the second element. The values of `start`, `target`, `tree`, `visited`, `current`, and `dist` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree where `tree[current]` is a non-empty list with at least one more unprocessed neighbor, `queue` includes the new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `visited` includes `unvisited_node` and `neighbor` from the previous iteration and now also includes `neighbor`, `current` is the first value of the popped tuple from `queue`, and `dist` is the second value of the popped tuple from `queue`.**
