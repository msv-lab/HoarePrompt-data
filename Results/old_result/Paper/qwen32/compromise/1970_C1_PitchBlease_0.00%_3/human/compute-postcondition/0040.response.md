The code snippet `current, dist = queue.popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the `queue` and assigns it to the tuple `(current, dist)`. This means that `current` will now hold the first element of the tuple (which was the first element of the queue), and `dist` will hold the second element of the tuple (which was the second element of the queue).

Given the initial state:
- `queue` is not empty, so it must contain at least one tuple.
- `visited` contains all reachable nodes from `start`.
- `current` is the last node processed.
- `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`.

After the execution of the code, the following changes occur:
- The `queue` will have one less element, as the leftmost element has been removed.
- `current` will be updated to the first element of the tuple that was removed from the queue.
- `dist` will be updated to the second element of the tuple that was removed from the queue.

The `visited` list remains unchanged as the code does not modify it. The `queue` is now one element shorter, and `current` and `dist` are updated to the values of the tuple that was just removed from the queue.

Output State: **`queue` is not empty (if it had more than one element), `visited` contains all reachable nodes from `start`, `current` is the first element of the tuple removed from the queue, `dist` is the second element of the tuple removed from the queue.**
