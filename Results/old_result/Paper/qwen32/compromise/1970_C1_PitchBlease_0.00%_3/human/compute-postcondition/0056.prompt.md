Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `queue` is not empty (if it had more than one element), `visited` contains all reachable nodes from `start`, `current` is the first element of the tuple removed from the queue, `dist` is the second element of the tuple removed from the queue. If `current` equals `target`, the program returns `dist`, which is the second element of the tuple removed from the queue. Otherwise, the program continues without returning.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `queue` is not empty and may or may not contain an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. `visited` contains all reachable nodes from `start`, and if `neighbor` was not already in `visited`, it is now included. `current` is the first element of the tuple removed from the queue and is a key in `tree` with `tree[current]` having at least one element. `dist` is the second element of the tuple removed from the queue.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `queue` is not empty, and if `neighbor` was not in `visited`, it is now included and `queue` contains an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. `visited` contains all reachable nodes from `start`, including `neighbor` if it was not already visited. `current` is the first element of the tuple removed from the queue and is a key in `tree` with `tree[current]` having at least two elements. `dist` is the second element of the tuple removed from the queue, and `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]` that has not yet been processed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `queue` is not empty, `visited` contains all reachable nodes from `start`, including `neighbor` if it was not already visited, `current` is the first element of the tuple removed from the queue and is a key in `tree` with `tree[current]` having at least two elements, `dist` is the second element of the tuple removed from the queue, `neighbor` is the next unprocessed element in `tree[current]`. If `neighbor` was not in `visited`, `queue` contains an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` and `visited` includes `neighbor`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
