Output State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree where `tree[current]` is a non-empty list with at least one more unprocessed neighbor, `queue` is a deque, `visited` includes `unvisited_node` and `neighbor` from the previous iteration and now also includes `neighbor`, `current` is the first value of the popped tuple from `queue`, and `dist` is the second value of the popped tuple from `queue`.**

In natural language: The `visited` set now includes the `neighbor` node, which was not previously in the set. All other variables retain their initial values and states.
