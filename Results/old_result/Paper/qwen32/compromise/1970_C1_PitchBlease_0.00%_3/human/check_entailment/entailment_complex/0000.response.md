### Reasoning:

The given problem involves determining the winner of a game played on a tree structure where the tree has exactly two leaves. The game is played by two players, Ron and Hermione, who take turns moving a stone along the tree's edges until no valid move is possible. Ron starts the game, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

The solution involves calculating the shortest path from the starting node to both leaves of the tree using Breadth-First Search (BFS). The logic for determining the winner is as follows:
- If at least one of the shortest paths from the starting node to the two leaves is even in length, Ron wins.
- If both shortest paths are odd in length, Hermione wins.

Let's break down the functions provided:

1. **func_1(n, edges, start)**:
   - This function constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree.
   - It identifies the two leaves of the tree.
   - It calculates the shortest path distances from the starting node to both leaves using the `bfs` function.
   - It checks the parity (even or odd) of these distances and determines the winner based on the rules provided.

2. **bfs(start, target)**:
   - This function performs a BFS to find the shortest path distance from the `start` node to the `target` node.
   - It uses a queue to explore the tree level by level.
   - It returns the shortest path distance if the `target` is reachable, otherwise, it returns -1.

The provided code correctly implements the BFS algorithm and uses it to calculate the required distances. The logic for determining the winner based on the parity of the distances is also correctly implemented.

### Correctness:

The program correctly constructs the tree, identifies the leaves, calculates the shortest path distances, and determines the winner based on the given rules. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
