The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree, a list of tuples `edges` representing the edges between nodes, and an integer `start` representing the starting node. It returns 'Ron' if at least one of the distances from the starting node to any two leaf nodes is even, otherwise it returns 'Hermione'.
