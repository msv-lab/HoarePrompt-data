The code appends the value of `max` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, if `x` was even, `max` is 99999999, and if `x` was odd, `max` is 100000000. Therefore, `ans` will have an additional element, which is either 99999999 or 100000000, depending on whether `x` was even or odd.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is the input integer divided by 2 if it is even, otherwise `x` is the input integer minus 1 and `x` is not equal to 1 or 0. `max` is 99999999 if `x` was even, otherwise `max` is 100000000. `min` is -99999999 if `x` was odd, otherwise `min` is -100000000. `ans` is [100000000, 99999999] if `x` was even, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000, 100000000]. `i` is incremented by 1.**
