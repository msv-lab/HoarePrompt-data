Postcondition: **`t` is 2. If the original `x` was even, `x` is now the result of the current `x` divided by 2, `max` is 99999997, `min` is 99999999, and `ans` is `[100000000, 99999999, 99999998]`. If the original `x` was odd, `x` is now the result of the current `x` decremented by 1 twice, `max` is -100000001, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is `[-100000000, -99999999, -100000000]`.**
