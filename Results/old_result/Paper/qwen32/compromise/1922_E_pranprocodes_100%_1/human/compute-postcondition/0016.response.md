Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is an input integer and must not be equal to 1, `max` and `min` are adjusted based on whether `x` is even or odd, and `ans` is set to either [100000000] if `x` is even or [-100000000] if `x` is odd. Specifically, if `x` is even, `x` is divided by 2 and `max` is set to 99999999, while if `x` is odd, `min` is set to -99999999.**

In natural language: The value of `t` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. The values of `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state.
