Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is `t + 1`.
Code of the loop:
while x != 1:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        ans.append(max)
        max -= 1
        x = x // 2
    else:
        ans.append(min)
        min += 1
        x -= 1
    t += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1, `x` is an input integer that has been modified based on its parity (`x` is divided by 2 if it was even, or reduced by 1 if it was odd), `max` is 99999999 if `x` was even and 100000000 if `x` was odd, `min` is -100000000 if `x` was even and -99999999 if `x` was odd, `ans` is [100000000] if `x` was even and [-100000000] if `x` was odd, `i` is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is 2, `x` is either `x // 2` if `x` was even or `x - 1` if `x` was odd (and `x` must not be 1), `max` is 99999998 if `x` was even and `x - 1` was even, 99999999 if `x` was even and `x - 1` was odd, 100000000 if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was even, or 100000000 if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was odd, `min` is -100000000 if `x` was even and `x - 1` was even, -99999999 if `x` was even and `x - 1` was odd, -99999999 if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was even, or -99999998 if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was odd, `ans` is [100000000, 100000000] if `x` was even, [100000000, -100000000] if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was even, or [-100000000, -99999999] if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was odd, and `i` is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is 3, `x` is `x // 2` if `x` was even, otherwise `x` remains the same and is any value other than 2, `max` is updated based on the evenness of `x` and `x - 1` as follows: 99999997 if both `x // 2` and `x // 2 - 1` are even, 99999998 if `x // 2` is even and `x // 2 - 1` is odd, 99999999 if `x // 2` is odd and `x // 2 - 1` is even, or 99999999 if `x // 2` is odd and `x // 2 - 1` is odd, and for the else case, `max` is 99999999 if both `x` and `x - 1` are even, 99999998 if `x` is even and `x - 1` is odd, 100000000 if `x` is odd and `x - 1` is even, or 100000000 if `x` is odd and `x - 1` is odd, `min` is updated similarly based on the evenness of `x` and `x - 1` as follows: -100000000 if both `x // 2` and `x // 2 - 1` are even, -99999999 if `x // 2` is even and `x // 2 - 1` is odd, -99999999 if `x // 2` is odd and `x // 2 - 1` is even, or -99999998 if `x // 2` is odd and `x // 2 - 1` is odd, and for the else case, `min` is -99999998 if both `x` and `x - 1` are even, -99999997 if `x` is even and `x - 1` is odd, -99999998 if `x` is odd and `x - 1` is even, or -99999997 if `x` is odd and `x - 1` is odd, `ans` is updated based on the evenness of `x` and `x - 1` as follows: [100000000, 100000000, `max`] if `x` was even, [100000000, -100000000, `max`] if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was even, or [-100000000, -99999999, `max`] if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was odd, and for the else case, `ans` is [100000000, 100000000, -99999999] if both `x` and `x - 1` are even, [100000000, 100000000, -99999998] if `x` is even and `x - 1` is odd, [100000000, -100000000, -99999999] if `x` is odd and `x - 1` is even, or [-100000000, -99999999, -99999998] if `x` is odd and `x - 1` is odd, `i` is 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
