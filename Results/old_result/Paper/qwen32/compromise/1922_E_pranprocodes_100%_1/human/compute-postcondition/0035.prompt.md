Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while x != 1:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        ans.append(max)
        max -= 1
        x = x // 2
    else:
        ans.append(min)
        min += 1
        x -= 1
    t += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1, `x` is an input integer and must not be equal to 1, `max` and `min` are adjusted based on whether `x` is even or odd, and `ans` is set to either [100000000] if `x` is even or [-100000000] if `x` is odd. Specifically, if `x` is even, `x` is divided by 2 and `max` is set to 99999999, while if `x` is odd, `min` is set to -99999999.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is 2, `x` is an input integer that has been either divided by 2 (if the original `x` is even) or decremented by 1 (if the original `x` is odd) and is not equal to 1. If the original `x` is even, `max` is 99999998 and `ans` is `[100000000, 99999999]`. If the original `x` is odd, `min` is -99999998 and `ans` is `[-100000000, -99999999]`. If the original `x` is even, `min` is 99999999. If the original `x` is odd, `max` is -100000000`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is 3; if the original `x` was even, `x` is now the result of the current `x` divided by 2, `max` is 99999997, `min` is 99999999, and `ans` is `[100000000, 99999999, 99999998]`. If the original `x` was odd, `x` is now the result of the current `x` decremented by 1 twice, `max` is -100000001, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is `[-100000000, -99999999, -100000000]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
