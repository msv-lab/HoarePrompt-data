The value of `x` is updated to be `x // 2`. Since `x` is an even input integer, `x // 2` will also be an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `x` is an input integer divided by 2 (and `x` is still even), `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [100000000], `i` is `t + 1`**.
