Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is any value other than 2, `max` is 99999999 if `x` was even and `x - 1` was even, 99999998 if `x` was even and `x - 1` was odd, 100000000 if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was even, or 100000000 if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was odd, `min` is -99999998 if `x` was even and `x - 1` was even, -99999997 if `x` was even and `x - 1` was odd, -99999998 if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was even, or -99999997 if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was odd, `ans` is [100000000, 100000000, -99999999] if `x` was even and `x - 1` was even, [100000000, 100000000, -99999998] if `x` was even and `x - 1` was odd, [100000000, -100000000, -99999999] if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was even, or [-100000000, -99999999, -99999998] if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was odd, `i` is 1**

Natural language explanation: The value of `x` has been decremented by 1. The values of `t`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.
