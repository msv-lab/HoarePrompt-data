The code snippet appends the value of `max` to the list `ans`. Therefore, the list `ans` will now have three elements: the original two elements followed by the value of `max`.

Given the initial state, the value of `max` can be one of four specific values depending on the parity of `x` and `x - 1`. The values of `t`, `x`, `min`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is any value other than 1, `max` is 99999998 if `x` was even and `x - 1` was even, 99999999 if `x` was even and `x - 1` was odd, 100000000 if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was even, or 100000000 if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was odd, `min` is -100000000 if `x` was even and `x - 1` was even, -99999999 if `x` was even and `x - 1` was odd, -99999999 if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was even, or -99999998 if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was odd, `ans` is [100000000, 100000000, `max`] if `x` was even, [100000000, -100000000, `max`] if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was even, or [-100000000, -99999999, `max`] if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was odd, and `i` is 1.**
