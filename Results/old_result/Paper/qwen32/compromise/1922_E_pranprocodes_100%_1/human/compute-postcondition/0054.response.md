Postcondition: **`t` is 0, `x` is the input integer divided by 2 if it is even, otherwise `x` is the input integer minus 1. `x` is not equal to 1 or 0. `max` is 99999999 if `x` was even, otherwise `max` is 100000000. `min` is -99999999 if `x` was odd, otherwise `min` is -100000000. `ans` is [100000000] if `x` was even, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000]. `i` is incremented by 1.**
