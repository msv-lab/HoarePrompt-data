The function `func` accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `X` such that 2 <= X <= 10^18. The function processes each test case individually and returns a result for each one. The specific result for each test case is not detailed in the provided information, but the functionality can be described based on the given constraints and structure.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes an integer `X` (2 <= X <= 10^18) and returns a result for each test case.**
