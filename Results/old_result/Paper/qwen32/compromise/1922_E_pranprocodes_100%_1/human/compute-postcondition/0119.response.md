Functionality: **The function processes a number of test cases, each consisting of an integer `X`. For each test case, it calculates the number of iterations required to reduce `X` to 1 by repeatedly dividing it by 2 if even or subtracting 1 if odd, and generates a sequence of values based on the operations performed. It outputs the number of iterations and the sequence for each test case.**
