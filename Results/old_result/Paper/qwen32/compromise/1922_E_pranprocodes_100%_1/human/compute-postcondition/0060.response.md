The code appends the value of `min` to the list `ans`. 

If `x` was even, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` initially is [100000000]. After appending, `ans` becomes [100000000, -100000000].

If `x` was odd, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` initially is [-100000000]. After appending, `ans` becomes [-100000000, -99999999].

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is the input integer divided by 2 if it is even, otherwise `x` is the input integer minus 1 and `x` is not equal to 1 or 0. `max` is 99999999 if `x` was even, otherwise `max` is 100000000. `min` is -99999999 if `x` was odd, otherwise `min` is -100000000. `ans` is [100000000, -100000000] if `x` was even, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000, -99999999]. `i` is incremented by 1**.
