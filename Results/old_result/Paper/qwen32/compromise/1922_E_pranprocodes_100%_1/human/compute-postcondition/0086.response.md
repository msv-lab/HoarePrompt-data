The code appends the value of `max` to the list `ans`. The value of `max` is 100000000. Therefore, the list `ans` will now contain one element, which is 100000000. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is 0, `x` is an input integer and `x` must not be 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [100000000], `i` is `t + 1`, and `x` is even**.
