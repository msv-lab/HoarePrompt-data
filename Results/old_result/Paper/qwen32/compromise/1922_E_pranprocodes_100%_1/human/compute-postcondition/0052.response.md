The code snippet increments the `min` variable by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the new value of `min` is -99999999. The other conditions and values of the variables are still valid as per the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `x` is the input integer and `x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is [-100000000], `i` is incremented by 1, and `x` is not divisible by 2.**
