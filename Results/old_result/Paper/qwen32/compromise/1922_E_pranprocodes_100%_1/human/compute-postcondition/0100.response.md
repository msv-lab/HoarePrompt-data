The code snippet increments the value of `min` by 1. Given the initial state, `min` is either -100000000 (if `x` is even) or -99999999 (if `x` is odd). After the operation, `min` becomes -99999999 (if `x` is even) or -99999998 (if `x` is odd).

Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` must not be 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` was even and 100000000 if `x` was odd, `min` is -99999999 if `x` was even and -99999998 if `x` was odd, `ans` is [100000000, -100000000] if `x` was even and [-100000000, -99999999] if `x` was odd, `i` is 1**.
