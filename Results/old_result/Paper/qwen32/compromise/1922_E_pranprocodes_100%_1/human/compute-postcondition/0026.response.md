The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is an input integer that has been either divided by 2 (if the original `x` is even) or decremented by 1 (if the original `x` is odd) and is not equal to 1.

Since `x` is not equal to 1, the loop can certainly execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is 2, `x` is an input integer that has been either divided by 2 (if the original `x` is even) or decremented by 1 (if the original `x` is odd) and is not equal to 1. If the original `x` is even, `max` is 99999998 and `ans` is `[100000000, 99999999]`. If the original `x` is odd, `min` is -99999998 and `ans` is `[-100000000, -99999999]`. If the original `x` is even, `min` is 99999999. If the original `x` is odd, `max` is -100000000**
