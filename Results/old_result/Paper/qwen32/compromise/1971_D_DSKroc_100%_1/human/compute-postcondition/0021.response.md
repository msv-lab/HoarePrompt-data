Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `s` is a string input by the user and has a length of at least 2, `i` is `i + 2`. If the integer value of the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the integer value of the character at index `i + 1` in `s`, then `flag` is 1 if the integer value of the character at index `i + 1` in `s` is less than the integer value of the character at index `i + 2` in `s`, otherwise `flag` remains 0, and `count` is incremented by 2 if the integer value of the character at index `i + 1` in `s` is not equal to the integer value of the character at index `i + 2` in `s`, otherwise `count` is incremented by 1. If the integer value of the character at index `i` in `s` is equal to the integer value of the character at index `i + 1` in `s`, then `flag` and `count` remain unchanged. If `int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1])`, then `flag` is set to 1.**
