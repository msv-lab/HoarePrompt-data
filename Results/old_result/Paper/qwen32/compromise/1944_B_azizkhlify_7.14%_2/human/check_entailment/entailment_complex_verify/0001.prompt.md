You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers. For each test case, it prints pairs of integers from the list `a` based on specific conditions related to the frequency of each integer in the list. The function ensures that it prints `k` pairs of integers that appear exactly twice in the list, and if necessary, it prints additional unique integers that appear only once to reach the required count of `k` pairs. The function maintains the input values `t`, `n`, and `a` unchanged and outputs the specified integers for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
Given an array `a` of length `2n` consisting of integers from `1` to `n` each appearing exactly twice, and an integer `k`, find two arrays `l` and `r` of length `2k` such that:
- `l` is a subset of the first `n` elements of `a`.
- `r` is a subset of the last `n` elements of `a`.
- The bitwise XOR of elements in `l` equals the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - Two arrays `l` and `r` are initialized to count occurrences of each integer in the first and second halves of `a`, respectively.

3. **Creating Subsets:**
   - The program first tries to fill `l` with pairs of identical elements from the first half of `a` (i.e., integers that appear exactly twice).
   - If `l` still needs more elements to reach length `2k`, it adds single occurrences from the first half.
   - It then attempts to mirror this process for `r` using the second half of `a`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `l` and `r` in the required format.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Initialization and Use of Arrays:**
  - The arrays `l` and `r` are initialized with length `n`, but they are used to count occurrences of each integer from `1` to `n`. This is correct.
  - However, the program then uses these arrays to store the elements of `l` and `r` directly, which is incorrect. The arrays `l` and `r` should be used for counting, and the elements of `l` and `r` should be stored in separate lists.

- **Logic of Filling `l` and `r`:**
  - The program correctly identifies pairs of identical elements and adds them to `l`.
  - However, the logic for adding single occurrences and ensuring the XOR condition is not robust. The program does not guarantee that the XOR of elements in `l` will equal the XOR of elements in `r`.

- **Output Handling:**
  - The program attempts to mirror the process for `r`, but it does not ensure that the XOR condition is met.
  - The program does not handle the case where `ul` (used length of `l`) is not equal to `ur` (used length of `r`) correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly ensure that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` equals the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`. It also mishandles the storage of elements in `l` and `r`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
