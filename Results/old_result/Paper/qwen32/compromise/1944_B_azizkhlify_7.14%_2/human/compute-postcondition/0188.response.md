To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `ul` is not equal to `ur` unless the if condition was met and the loop or if statement was broken out of, in which case `ul` and `ur` are equal.
2. `n` is a non-negative integer.
3. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2, then `ur` is increased by 2.
4. `i` is `i + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement prints `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, and does not move to the next line after printing due to `end=' '`.
- The value of `a[i]` depends on the list `a` and the current value of `i`.

### Given Information:
- The exact values of `a`, `i`, and `n` are not provided directly.
- However, we know that `i` is incremented by 1 in the initial state, which means `i` must have been set to some value before this print statement was reached.

### Conclusion:
Since we don't have the exact values of `a` and `i`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i of the list a)**
