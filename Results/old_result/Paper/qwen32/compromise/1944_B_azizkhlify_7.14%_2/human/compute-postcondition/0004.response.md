The code `r = [0] * n` creates a new list `r` with `n` elements, all initialized to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, or `l`. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element is 0, `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element is 0.**
