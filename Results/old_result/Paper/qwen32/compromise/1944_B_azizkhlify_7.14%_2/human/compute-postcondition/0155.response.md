To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. However, `t` is not directly used in the given print statement.
2. **`n`**: An integer greater than or equal to 1. Again, `n` is not directly used in the given print statement.
3. **`i`**: An integer initialized to 1.
4. **`re`**: This variable is mentioned in the context of a loop or conditional statement but its exact value and role are not provided. It is stated that if `re` equals `k`, the loop or conditional statement is broken out of. However, `re` is not directly used in the print statement.
5. **`res`**: Similar to `re`, this variable is mentioned but not directly used in the print statement.
6. **`a`**: This is presumably a list or array, but its contents are not specified in the initial state. The print statement attempts to access `a[i]`, where `i` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is trying to print the element at index `i` of the list or array `a`.
- From the initial state, we know `i` is initialized to 1.
- The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function specifies that a space should be printed after the output, instead of the default newline.

### Output Determination:
- Since `i` is 1, the statement will print the element at index 1 of the list or array `a`.
- However, the specific contents of the list `a` are not provided in the initial state, so we can only describe the output in terms of the element at index 1 of `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[1] (where a[1] is the element at index 1 of the list `a`)**
