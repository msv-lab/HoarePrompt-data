To determine what will be printed by the `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the relevant variables.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
2. **n**: An integer such that \(n \geq 2\).
3. **a**: A list of integers read from the input.
4. **l**: A list where each index \(j\) contains the count of how many times \(j+1\) appears in \(a\).
5. **r**: A list of \(n\) zeros with the value at index \(a[i] - 1\) incremented by 1 for each \(i\) from \(n\) to \(2 \times n - 1\).
6. **ul**: Either 4, 2, or 0.
7. **ur**: 0.
8. **res**: An empty list.
9. **k**: The second integer from the input.
10. **re**: 0.
11. **i**: 2.

The specific values of \(a\), \(n\), \(k\), and other variables are not explicitly provided, but we know that \(i\) is initialized to 2.

### Analysis of the `print` Statement

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```
Here, `i` is 2, so `a[i]` refers to the element at index 2 of the list `a`.

### Output Determination

Since `i` is 2, `a[i]` is `a[2]`. The `print` statement will print the value at index 2 of the list `a` twice, separated by a space, and without a newline at the end due to `end=' '`.

### Final Output

Given the above analysis, the output will be:
Output: **a[2] a[2]** (where `a[2]` is the element at index 2 of the list `a`)
