Postcondition: **`ul` is 4 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, otherwise `ul` remains 2; `ur` is 0; `re` is 0; `n` is a positive integer; `k` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `l` is a list of `n` integers where each index `j` contains the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in `a`; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each index `j` contains the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in `a` from index `n` to `2 * n - 1`; `i` is 1; and `res` is an empty list. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, the program proceeds with the if part's postcondition. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables and the program continues.**
