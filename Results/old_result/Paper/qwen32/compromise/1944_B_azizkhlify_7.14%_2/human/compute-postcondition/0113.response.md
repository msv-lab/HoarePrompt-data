The code snippet `l[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at the index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` by 1. Given that `l` is a list of `n` zeros except `l[a[i] - 1]` which is initially 2, after the operation, the value at `l[a[i] - 1]` will be 3.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `l` is a list of `n` zeros except `l[a[i] - 1]` which is 3, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `k` is the second integer from the input, `re` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1**.
