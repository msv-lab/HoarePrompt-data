Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `re` is equal to `k`, `res` is unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `re`, and `res` remain as they were, except `re` is now specifically equal to `k`. The loop or if statement we were in is exited.
