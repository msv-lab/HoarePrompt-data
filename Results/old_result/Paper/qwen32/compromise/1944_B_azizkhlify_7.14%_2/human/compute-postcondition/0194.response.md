To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `ul` and `ur` are not equal unless a specific condition is met, in which case they become equal.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (though the initial value of `i` is not provided, it is assumed to be some integer).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet prints the element at index `i` of the list `a` twice, followed by a space.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1 before the print statement, so `i` refers to the index in the list `a` that has been incremented.
- The exact value of `a[i]` depends on the contents of the list `a` and the value of `i`, which is not explicitly given in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact contents of the list `a` and the initial value of `i` are not provided, we cannot determine the specific numerical value of `a[i]`. However, we can describe the output in terms of `a[i]`.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i of the list a)**
