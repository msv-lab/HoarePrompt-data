Postcondition: **`ul` is `k * 2` if `k * 2` is reached before `n` iterations; otherwise, `ul` is `2 * n`. `ur` is 0. `re` is incremented by 1 if `l[a[4] - 1] == 1` and `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`. `n` is a positive integer. `k` is a non-zero integer and `k` is `2 * k - ul`. `a` is a list of integers read from input. `l` is a list of `n` integers where each index `j` contains the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in `a`. `r` is a list of `n` integers where each index `j` contains the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in `a` from index `n` to `2 * n - 1`. `res` contains `a[4]` and `a[5]` if `l[a[4] - 1] == 1`. `i` is 5. If `re` is equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
