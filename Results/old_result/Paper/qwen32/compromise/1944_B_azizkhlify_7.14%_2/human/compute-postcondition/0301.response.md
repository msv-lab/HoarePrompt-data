Postcondition: **`ul` is `k * 2` if `k * 2` is reached before `n` iterations; otherwise, `2 * n`. `ur` is 0. `re` is the number of unique elements with count 1 found in `a` up to `k` or `n` iterations. `n` is unchanged. `k` is unchanged. `a` is unchanged. `l` is unchanged. `r` is unchanged. `res` is unchanged. `i` is the last element in `res`. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, the program does not modify any of the variables.**
