Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000 (This variable is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `l` is a list where each index `j` contains the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`.
- `r` is a list of `n` zeros with the value at index `a[i] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`.
- `ul` is either 2 or 0.
- `ur` is 0.
- `res` is an empty list.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `re` is 0.
- `i` is 1.

The condition `If ul equals k * 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of` does not affect the provided print statement, so we can ignore it for this specific print statement.

### Code Snippet
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- The print statement prints the element at index `i` of list `a` twice, separated by a space, and does not end the line after printing (due to `end=' '`).

### Output
Since `i` is 1, the print statement will output the element at index 1 of the list `a` twice.

### Final Answer
Output: **a[1] a[1] (where a[1] is the second element of the list `a`)**
