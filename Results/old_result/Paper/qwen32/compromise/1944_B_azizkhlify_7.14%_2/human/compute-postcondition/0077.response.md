Postcondition: **t remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n remains the first integer read from the input, a remains the list of n integers read from the input, l remains a list of n integers where each element at index a[i] - 1 is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of a[i] in a, r is a list of n integers where each element at index a[i] - 1 has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of a[i] in the range from a[n] to a[2*n - 1], ul is either k * 2 if the loop broke or less than k * 2 if the loop completed all iterations, ur remains 0, res is an empty list, k is updated to 2 * k - ul if non-zero, re is the number of times l[a[i] - 1] was equal to 1 before the loop broke or until all iterations were completed, and ul is not equal to ur.**
