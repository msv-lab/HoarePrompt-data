Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1`
- `k` is -2
- `b` is `p[b] - 1`
- `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input
- `sp` is `3 * a[s]`
- `bp` is `3 * a[b]`
- `sm` is `a[s]`
- `bm` is `max(bm, a[b])`
- `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input
- We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Code to Execute:
```python
sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
```

Now, let's break down the code snippet:
- The variable `sm` is updated. It is incremented by the maximum value between `sm` and the expression `a[s] * k + sp`.

Given `k` is -2 and `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, the expression `a[s] * k + sp` simplifies to:
- `a[s] * (-2) + 3 * a[s]`
- `-2 * a[s] + 3 * a[s]`
- `a[s]`

Therefore, `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` simplifies to `max(sm, a[s])`.

So, `sm` becomes `sm + max(sm, a[s])`, which simplifies to:
- If `sm >= a[s]`, then `sm` remains `sm + sm` or `2 * sm`.
- If `sm < a[s]`, then `sm` becomes `sm + a[s]`.

Since the exact values of `sm` and `a[s]` are not provided, we can only express the output state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`, `sm` is `2 * sm` if `sm >= a[s]` else `sm + a[s]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b])`, `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
