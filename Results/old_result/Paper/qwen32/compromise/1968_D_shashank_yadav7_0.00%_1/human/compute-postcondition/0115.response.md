Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is 0 (as per the if condition), `b` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `s` is the fourth integer from the input minus 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `min(n-1, initial_k - 1) + 1`, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `sm` is `a[s] * k`, `bm` is `a[b] * k` (which simplifies to 0 since `k` is 0), and `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input. Since `k` is 0, `bm` is equal to `sm`, which is also 0.**
