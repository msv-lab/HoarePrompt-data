Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a` are as defined in the initial state.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b -= 1
    s -= 1
    sp = a[s]
    bp = a[b]
    bm = a[b] * k
    sm = a[s] * k
    for i in range(n):
        k -= 1
        if k == 0:
            break
        b = p[b] - 1
        s = p[s] - 1
        bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
        sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
        sp += a[s]
        bp += a[b]
    if bm > sm:
        print('Bodya')
    elif bm < sm:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. `i` is `n` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise it is the value of `i` when `k` becomes 0. `n` is the number of iterations the loop was supposed to run. `k` is 0 if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise it is the value of `k` when the loop breaks. `s` is updated based on the values in the list `p` for `n` iterations or until `k` becomes 0. `b` is updated based on the values in the list `p` for `n` iterations or until `k` becomes 0. `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input. `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input. `sp` accumulates the values from the list `a` for `n` iterations or until `k` becomes 0. `bp` accumulates the values from the list `a` for `n` iterations or until `k` becomes 0. `bm` accumulates the maximum values based on the current `bp` and `sp` along with the values from the list `a` and the current value of `k` for `n` iterations or until `k` becomes 0. `sm` accumulates the maximum values based on the current `bp` and `sp` along with the values from the list `a` and the current value of `k` for `n` iterations or until `k` becomes 0. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `min(n-1, initial_k - 1)`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is `max(0, initial_k - i - 1)`, `b` is updated `i` times based on `p`, `s` is updated `i` times based on `p`, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `a[s] * (i + 1)`, `bp` is `a[b] * (i + 1) - 1`, `sm` is updated based on the maximum of its current value and a calculated expression for each iteration, `bm` is updated based on the maximum of its current value and a calculated expression for each iteration, `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` remains greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is equal to `sm`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is 0, `b` is the result of `k_initial` iterations of `b = p[b] - 1`, `s` is the result of `k_initial` iterations of `s = p[s] - 1`, `sm` is the accumulated maximum value after `k_initial` iterations, `bm` is the accumulated maximum value after `k_initial` iterations, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` repeated `k_initial` times, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` repeated `k_initial` times`, `n`, `t`, `a`, `p`, `i` remain unchanged. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is strictly greater than `sm`. If `bm` is less than `sm`, then `bm` is strictly less than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is equal to `sm`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
