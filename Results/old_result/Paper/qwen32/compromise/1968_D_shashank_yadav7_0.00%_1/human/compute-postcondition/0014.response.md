Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, `s-1` are integers obtained from the input, `b` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `bp * (k - 1)`, `sm` is `sp * (k - 1)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
