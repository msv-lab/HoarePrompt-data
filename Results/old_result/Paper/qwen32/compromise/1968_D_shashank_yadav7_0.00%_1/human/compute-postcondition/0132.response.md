The code snippet `sp += a[s]` increments the value of `sp` by the value of `a[s]`. Given the initial state, `sp` was initially `2 * a[s]`. After the operation, `sp` becomes `2 * a[s] + a[s]`, which simplifies to `3 * a[s]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i`, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`, `sm` is `a[s]`, `bm` is `max(bm, bp - a[b])`, and `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
