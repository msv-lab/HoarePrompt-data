The code snippet `bp += a[b]` increments the value of `bp` by the value of `a[b]`. Given the initial state, `bp` was initially set to `a[b]`. After the operation, `bp` will be `a[b] + a[b]`, which simplifies to `2 * a[b]`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `min(n-1, initial_k - 1) + 1`, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`, `sm` is `a[s]`, `bm` is `a[b]`, and `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
