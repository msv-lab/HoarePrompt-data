The code snippet `k -= 1` decrements the value of `k` by 1. Given the initial state, `k` is 0, so after the operation, `k` will be -1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b] - 1`, `sm` is `a[s] * (k + 1) + max(a[s] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp)`, `bm` is `a[b] + max(a[b], bp)`**
