To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the provided code snippet on the variables. Here is the code snippet again:

```python
bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
```

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1`
- `k` is -2
- `b` is `p[b] - 1`
- `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input
- `sp` is `3 * a[s]`
- `bp` is `3 * a[b]`
- `sm` is `a[s]`
- `bm` is `max(bm, bp - a[b])`
- `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input
- We break out of the most internal loop or if statement

This code snippet updates the value of `bm` by adding to it the maximum of its current value and the expression `a[b] * k + bp`. Let's break this down:

1. **Expression Calculation**: The expression `a[b] * k + bp` is calculated where `k` is -2 and `bp` is `3 * a[b]`. Therefore, the expression becomes `a[b] * (-2) + 3 * a[b]`, which simplifies to `a[b] * (-2 + 3)`, or `a[b] * 1`, which is simply `a[b]`.

2. **Updating `bm`**: `bm` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `a[b]`. So, `bm` becomes `max(bm, a[b])`.

Now, let's update the output state:
- `n` must still be greater than `i + 1`
- `k` is still -2
- `b` is `p[b] - 1`
- `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`
- `t` is still a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `i` is still `i + 1`
- `a` is still a new list of integers obtained from the input
- `sp` is still `3 * a[s]`
- `bp` is still `3 * a[b]`
- `sm` is still `a[s]`
- `bm` is now `max(bm, a[b])`
- `p` is still a new list of integers obtained from the input
- We still break out of the most internal loop or if statement

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`, `sm` is `a[s]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b])`, `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
