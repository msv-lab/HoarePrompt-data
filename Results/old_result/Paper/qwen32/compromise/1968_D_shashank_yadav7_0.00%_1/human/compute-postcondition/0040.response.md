The code snippet provided is `sp += a[s]`. This line adds the value of `a[s]` to the current value of `sp`. Let's determine the updated state of the variables after this operation.

Initial State: 
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `i` is 2
- `n` is greater than 2
- `k` is `k - 2`
- `s-1` are integers obtained from the input
- `b` is `p[p[original_b] - 1] - 1`
- `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `sp` is `3 * a[s]`
- `bp` is `3 * a[b]`
- `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`
- `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + 3 * a[s])`
- `s` is `p[s] - 1`
- If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

After executing `sp += a[s]`, the value of `sp` changes. Specifically, `sp` becomes `3 * a[s] + a[s]`, which simplifies to `4 * a[s]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 2; `k` is `k - 2`; `s-1` are integers obtained from the input; `b` is `p[p[original_b] - 1] - 1`; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `4 * a[s]`; `bp` is `3 * a[b]`; `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + 3 * a[s])`; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
