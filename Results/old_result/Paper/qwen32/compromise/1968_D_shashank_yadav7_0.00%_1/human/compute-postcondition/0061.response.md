The code snippet provided updates the value of `sm` to be the product of `a[s]` and `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `b` is the third integer from the input minus 1, `s` is the fourth integer from the input minus 1, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`, `sm` is `a[s] * k`, `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.**
