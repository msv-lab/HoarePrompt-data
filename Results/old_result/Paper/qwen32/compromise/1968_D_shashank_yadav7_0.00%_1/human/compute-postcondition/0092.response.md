Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `3 * a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b] - 1 + a[b]`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `bm` is `2 * bm`.**

In this output state, the only variable that has been changed is `bp`. It is now equal to its previous value plus `a[b]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
