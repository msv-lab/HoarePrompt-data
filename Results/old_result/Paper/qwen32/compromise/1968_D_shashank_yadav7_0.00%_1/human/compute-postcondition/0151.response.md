The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Draw'`. The initial state describes several variables (`k`, `b`, `s`, `sm`, `bm`, `sp`, `bp`, `n`, `t`, `a`, `p`, `i`) and their relationships, but these details do not affect the output of the `print` statement itself.

Since the `print` statement is simply outputting the string `'Draw'`, we do not need to evaluate the values of the variables described in the initial state to determine the output.

Output: **Draw**
