Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `3 * a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`, `sm` is `2 * sm` if `sm >= a[s]` else `sm + a[s]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b])`, `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms:
- `n` remains greater than `i + 1`.
- `k` remains -2.
- `b` remains `p[b] - 1`.
- `s` remains `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`.
- `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `i` remains `i + 1`.
- `a` remains the new list of integers obtained from the input.
- `sp` is now `4 * a[s]` (since `sp` was originally `3 * a[s]` and then `a[s]` was added to it).
- `bp` remains `3 * a[b]`.
- `sm` remains `2 * sm` if `sm >= a[s]` else `sm + a[s]`.
- `bm` remains `max(bm, a[b])`.
- `p` remains the new list of integers obtained from the input.
- The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
