The code snippet provided updates the value of `sp` by adding `a[s]` to it. Other variables remain unchanged unless their values are directly dependent on `sp`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `i` is 0
- `n` is greater than 0
- `k` is 0 if the if condition was met, otherwise `k` retains its original value
- `s-1` are integers obtained from the input
- `b` is `p[original_b] - 1` where `original_b` is the initial value of `b`
- `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `sp` is `a[s]`
- `bp` is `a[b]`
- `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`
- `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`
- `s` is `p[s] - 1`

The line `sp += a[s]` modifies `sp` by adding the value of `a[s]` to it. Therefore, the new value of `sp` is `a[s] + a[s]`, which simplifies to `2 * a[s]`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0 if the if condition was met, otherwise `k` retains its original value, `s-1` are integers obtained from the input, `b` is `p[original_b] - 1` where `original_b` is the initial value of `b`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`.**
