You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n, k, P_B, and P_S are positive integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. The permutation p is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive, and the array a is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    #State: After all iterations, `t` remains unchanged, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` are updated based on the input for each iteration, and the result of each comparison between `bm` and `sm` is printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the scores for Bodya and Sasha. Specifically, the logic for updating the scores and handling the moves is incorrect.

Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Score Calculation Logic**:
   - The scores are not being updated correctly in each iteration. The lines `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` are incorrect. The scores should simply be incremented by the value at the current position in each turn.
   - The variables `bp` and `sp` are not used correctly. They seem to be intended to store the initial scores, but they are not needed if the scores are updated correctly in each iteration.

2. **Loop Control**:
   - The loop control logic is flawed. The loop should run exactly `k` times, and the scores should be updated in each iteration. The current code uses a decrementing `k` and breaks out of the loop when `k` reaches 0, which is correct, but the score updates are incorrect.

3. **Position Update**:
   - The positions `b` and `s` are updated correctly by moving to `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1`, but the score updates are not handled properly.

Here is a corrected version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        bm = a[b]
        sm = a[s]
        for _ in range(k - 1):  # k-1 because we already counted the initial positions
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm += a[b]
            sm += a[s]
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

In this corrected version, the scores `bm` and `sm` are incremented by the value at the new position in each iteration, and the loop runs exactly `k-1` times to account for the initial positions already counted. This ensures that the scores are calculated correctly for both players after exactly `k` turns.
