Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem description to determine its correctness.

The problem states that Bob can form a different rectangle if he can cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then combine them to form a new rectangle with different dimensions (ignoring rotation).

The program logic in the given code is flawed and does not correctly follow the problem's requirements. Here is a breakdown of the issues:

1. The condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` is incorrect. It only checks if both dimensions are even, which is not a sufficient condition for forming a different rectangle. For example, a 2x2 rectangle can be cut into two 1x2 rectangles, which can form a 1x4 rectangle, so the output should be "Yes" for 2x2, not "No".

2. The condition `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):` is syntactically incorrect and does not make logical sense. The expression `(a - b == -a, a)` evaluates to a tuple `(False, a)` or `(True, a)` depending on the values of `a` and `b`, and similarly for the other part of the condition. This part of the code does not correctly check for any valid condition.

3. The condition `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:` is also incorrect. This condition will always evaluate to `True` for any pair of integers `a` and `b` except when `a == b`. This does not correctly determine if a different rectangle can be formed.

4. The `else` block will execute when none of the above conditions are met, which includes cases where a different rectangle can indeed be formed.

The correct logic should be to check if either `a` or `b` can be divided into two parts that can form a new rectangle with different dimensions. Specifically, if either `a` or `b` is even, then it is possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged into a new rectangle. This is because if `a` is even, we can cut it into two rectangles of size `a/2 x b`, and similarly for `b`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

Given this analysis, the original program is incorrect.

Your response:
Correctness: **False**
