Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the problem description in all cases.

The logic in the provided program is flawed. Here are a few issues:

1. The condition `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)` is incorrect and does not make logical sense. It seems like the intention is to check if `a` and `b` are the same, but the way it is written, it will not work as expected. It will always evaluate to `True` because `a - b == -a, a` will always be a tuple and thus truthy.

2. The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` will always be `True` for any non-zero `a - b`. This condition does not correctly determine if Bob can form another rectangle.

3. The logic for determining if Bob can form another rectangle is incorrect. According to the problem description, Bob can form another rectangle if at least one of the dimensions of the original rectangle is even. This is because he can cut the rectangle into two equal parts along the even dimension and then form a new rectangle.

Let's consider a counterexample:
- For the input `2 2`, the program should output `Yes` because Bob can cut the rectangle into two `2x1` rectangles and then form a `1x4` rectangle.
- For the input `3 3`, the program should output `No` because both dimensions are odd, and he cannot form another rectangle by cutting it into two equal parts.

However, the provided program will not handle these cases correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Here is a corrected version of the program for reference:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```
This corrected version checks if either `a` or `b` is even, which correctly determines if Bob can form another rectangle.
