Let's analyze the given program and compare it to the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires determining if Bob can cut a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) into two smaller rectangles and then form a new rectangle from those two smaller rectangles. The key points are:
- If \(a \times b\) can be cut into two rectangles of equal size, and those can form a new rectangle, then the answer is "Yes".
- Otherwise, the answer is "No".

### Conditions for a "Yes":
- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new one. For example, a \(4 \times 4\) rectangle can be cut into two \(4 \times 2\) rectangles, which can form an \(8 \times 2\) rectangle.
- If \(a\) and \(b\) are both odd, it is impossible to cut it into two equal smaller rectangles.
- If one of \(a\) or \(b\) is even and the other is odd, it is possible to cut it into two smaller rectangles and form a new one. For example, a \(3 \times 4\) rectangle can be cut into two \(3 \times 2\) rectangles, which can form a \(6 \times 2\) rectangle.

### Conditions for a "No":
- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the answer is "No".

### Program Analysis:
Let's examine the logic of the provided program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```
#### Issues in the Program:
1. The condition `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)` is incorrect. The expression is a tuple comparison, which is not what we need here.
2. The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is also incorrect. This condition will always be true for any non-zero difference between \(a\) and \(b\), which doesn't cover the correct logic for determining if a new rectangle can be formed.
3. The program does not correctly handle the case when one of \(a\) or \(b\) is even and the other is odd.

### Correct Logic:
- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, print "yes".
- If one of \(a\) or \(b\) is even and the other is odd, print "yes".
- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, print "no".

### Correct Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to logical errors in handling the conditions. The correct program should handle the cases where at least one of the dimensions is even.

**Correctness: False**
