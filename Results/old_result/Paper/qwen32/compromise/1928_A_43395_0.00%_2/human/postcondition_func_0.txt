The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of a rectangle. It then prints 'yes' if the rectangle can be divided into smaller rectangles of equal size where each smaller rectangle has both dimensions as even numbers, or if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd. Otherwise, it prints 'no'.
