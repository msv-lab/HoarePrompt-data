To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to consider the effect of the loop on the variables `n` and `k` and the printed outputs for each iteration.

The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the values of `n` and `k` are read, and the following logic is applied:

1. If `k == 1`, the output is `1`.
2. If `k <= 2 * n`, the output is `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
3. If `k > 2 * n`, the output is `k // 2 + 1`.

The values of `n` and `k` are local to each iteration and do not affect the state between iterations. Each iteration prints a result based on the current values of `n` and `k`.

Since the loop does not modify any external variables and only prints results, the state of the variables `n` and `k` after each iteration is irrelevant to the state of the variables before the next iteration. The only thing that changes is the printed output.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations will be a series of printed results, one for each test case, based on the logic described above. The variables `n` and `k` will be in their final state as read from the input for the last test case, but this does not affect the overall output state.

Output State: **A series of printed results, one for each test case, based on the given logic.**
