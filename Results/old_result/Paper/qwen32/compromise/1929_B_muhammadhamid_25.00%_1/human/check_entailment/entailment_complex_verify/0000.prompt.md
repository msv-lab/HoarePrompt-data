You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^8 and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        
    #State: A series of printed results, one for each test case, based on the given logic.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. If `k` is 1, it prints 1. If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, it prints the ceiling of `k / 2`. Otherwise, it prints `k // 2 + 1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
- The grid has \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total.
- We need to handle multiple test cases.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by considering the following logic:
- If \( k = 1 \), only one cell needs to be colored.
- If \( k \leq 2n \), the minimum number of cells to color is \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).
- If \( k > 2n \), the minimum number of cells to color is \( \lfloor \frac{k}{2} \rfloor + 1 \).

### Correctness Check:
Let's verify this logic with a few test cases and edge cases.

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: \( n = 3, k = 4 \)
- Expected Output: 2
- Program Output: 2 (Correct)

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: \( n = 3, k = 3 \)
- Expected Output: 2
- Program Output: 2 (Correct)

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: \( n = 3, k = 10 \)
- Expected Output: 6
- Program Output: 6 (Correct)

#### Test Case 4:
- Input: \( n = 3, k = 9 \)
- Expected Output: 5
- Program Output: 5 (Correct)

#### Test Case 5:
- Input: \( n = 4, k = 7 \)
- Expected Output: 4
- Program Output: 4 (Correct)

#### Test Case 6:
- Input: \( n = 7, k = 11 \)
- Expected Output: 6
- Program Output: 6 (Correct)

#### Test Case 7:
- Input: \( n = 2, k = 3 \)
- Expected Output: 2
- Program Output: 2 (Correct)

### Edge Case Analysis:
- **When \( k = 1 \):** The program correctly returns 1.
- **When \( k \leq 2n \):** The program correctly computes \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).
- **When \( k > 2n \):** The program correctly computes \( \lfloor \frac{k}{2} \rfloor + 1 \).

### Conclusion:
After analyzing several test cases and edge cases, the program appears to correctly compute the minimum number of cells to color for the given problem description. The logic handles all specified conditions and produces the expected results.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
