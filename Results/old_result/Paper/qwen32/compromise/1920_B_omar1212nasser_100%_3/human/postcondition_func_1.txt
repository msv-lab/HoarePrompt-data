The function `func_2` calculates and returns the maximum value from a list of computed sums based on the input parameters `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. The list `pos` is constructed by iteratively adjusting the sum of the elements in `elements` according to the specified rules, and the function ultimately returns the highest value in this list.
