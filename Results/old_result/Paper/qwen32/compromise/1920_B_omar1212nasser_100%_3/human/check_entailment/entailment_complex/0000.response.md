### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided functions and see if they correctly solve the problem as described.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x` which are the number of elements in the array, the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, and the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, respectively.
   - It then reads the array `a` of `n` positive integers.
   - The array `a` is sorted in ascending order.
   - The function `func_2` is called with the arguments `k`, `x`, and `a`.
   - The result from `func_2` is printed.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - `removals` is the maximum number of elements Alice can remove.
   - `negatives` is the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1.
   - `elements` is the sorted array of integers.
   - The function calculates the initial sum `s` of all elements in `elements`.
   - It calculates `s2`, the sum of the `negatives` largest elements in `elements`.
   - It initializes `pos` with the value `s - 2 * s2`. This value represents the sum if no elements are removed by Alice and `negatives` elements are multiplied by -1.
   - It iterates from `1` to `removals` (inclusive), adjusting the sum `s` by subtracting the `i`-th largest element in `elements` (since the array is sorted, the `i`-th largest element is at index `-i`).
   - It also adjusts `s2` by subtracting the `i`-th largest element and adding the `(negatives + i)`-th largest element if it exists.
   - It appends the adjusted sum `s - 2 * s2` to `pos` for each iteration.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from the `pos` list.

### Analysis:
- The logic in `func_2` is designed to consider all possible scenarios where Alice removes `0` to `removals` elements and Bob multiplies `0` to `negatives` elements by -1.
- The key idea is to compute the sum of the array after each possible removal and negation combination and return the maximum possible sum.
- The sorting of the array allows us to efficiently compute the sum of the largest elements, which are the ones Bob would want to negate to minimize the sum.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. They consider all possible moves by Alice and Bob and compute the optimal result based on these moves.

**Correctness: True**
