To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in the given code is:

```python
for i in range(1, removals + 1):
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `removals`. The loop will execute if `removals` is at least 1, because `range(1, removals + 1)` will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to `removals` inclusive. If `removals` is 0, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

The state of `i` is set automatically by the `range` function, so we do not need to adjust `i` manually. The only variable we need to ensure is properly set is `removals`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `removals` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`removals` must be greater than 0, `negatives` are non-negative integers, `elements` is a list of non-negative integers, the length of `elements` is at least the maximum of `removals` and `negatives`, `pos` is a list containing one element `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`, `s` is the sum of `elements`, `s2` is the sum of `elements[-negatives:]`**
