You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice has n books. The 1 -st book contains a_1 pages, the 2 -nd book contains
a_2 pages, \ldots , the n -th book contains a_n pages. Alice does the
following:

  * She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.
  * Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile.

Alice loves reading very much. Help her find the maximum total number of pages
she can read by dividing the books into two piles.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 100
) — the number of books Alice has.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the number of pages in each book.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of pages
Alice can read.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1 1
    
    4
    
    2 3 3 1

    2 2 3 2 2
    
    2
    
    10 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    2
    4
    5
    13
    5
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can put book number 1 in the first pile, and
book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2
pages.

In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first
pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read
the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the
highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 =
4 pages.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
        
    #State: The output state consists of `t` lines, each containing the sum of the maximum value in the first `n-1` elements and the last element of the list for each respective test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the maximum value from the first `n-1` integers and the last integer in the list, then outputs this sum.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

The task requires dividing the books into two non-empty piles and selecting the book with the maximum number of pages from each pile. The goal is to maximize the total number of pages read from the two selected books.

### Program Analysis

The provided program reads the input for multiple test cases and for each test case:
1. It reads the number of books `n`.
2. It reads the list of pages in each book `nums`.
3. It calculates the maximum number of pages in the list except the last book (`max(nums[:-1])`) and adds the number of pages in the last book (`nums[-1]`).
4. It prints the result.

### Flaws in the Program

The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the total number of pages read. Here is why:

- The program simply takes the maximum of all books except the last and adds the last book's pages. This does not guarantee that the two books selected are from two non-empty piles.
- It does not consider all possible ways to divide the books into two piles and select the maximum pages from each pile.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Find the two largest numbers in the list of pages.
2. The sum of these two largest numbers will give the maximum total number of pages Alice can read, as these two books can be in separate piles.

### Correct Implementation

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Find the two largest numbers in the list
        nums.sort()
        max1 = nums[-1]
        max2 = nums[-2]
        print(max1 + max2)

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
