Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program takes the maximum value from all elements except the last one and adds it to the last element, which does not necessarily give the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles.

To solve the problem, Alice should divide the books into two piles in such a way that the sum of the maximum pages in each pile is maximized. The correct approach would be to sort the list of pages and then take the two largest values, as these will give the maximum total number of pages she can read.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nums.sort()
        print(nums[-1] + nums[-2])

func()
```

This corrected version sorts the list of pages and then sums the two largest values, which is the optimal solution for the problem.
