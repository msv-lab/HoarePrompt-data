You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program aims to determine the minimum number of screens required to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid (15 cells total).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program logic:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads `x` and `y`.
2. **Space Calculation**:
    - `space_x` is calculated as `x * 1`, which is just `x`.
    - `space_y` is calculated as `y * 4`, representing the total cells occupied by 2x2 icons.
    - `total_space` is the sum of `space_x` and `space_y`.
3. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons**:
    - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`.
    - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`.
4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
    - `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, which represents the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.
5. **Screen Requirement for 1x1 Icons**:
    - If `space_x` (remaining 1x1 icons) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, then the total screens required is `screen_require_for_y`.
    - Otherwise, it calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons and adds them to `screen_require_for_y`.

### Edge Cases to Consider

1. **No Icons** (`x = 0`, `y = 0`):
    - Expected Output: `0` screens.
    - Program Output: `0` screens.
2. **Only 1x1 Icons** (`y = 0`):
    - Expected Output: `ceil(x / 15)` screens.
    - Program Output: Correctly calculates the screens.
3. **Only 2x2 Icons** (`x = 0`):
    - Expected Output: `ceil(y / 2)` screens.
    - Program Output: Correctly calculates the screens.
4. **Mixed Icons** (`x > 0`, `y > 0`):
    - Expected Output: Properly accounts for both 1x1 and 2x2 icons, ensuring no overlap and minimum screens.
    - Program Output: Needs verification for various combinations.
