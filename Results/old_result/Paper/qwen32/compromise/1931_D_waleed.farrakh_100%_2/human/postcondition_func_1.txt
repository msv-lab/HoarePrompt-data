The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes it to extract multiple test cases, and then calls another function `func_1` with these test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and a list `arr` of `n` integers. The function prints the results returned by `func_1` for each test case.
