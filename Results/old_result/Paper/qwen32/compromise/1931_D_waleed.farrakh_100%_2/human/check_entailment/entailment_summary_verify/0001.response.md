### Reasoning:

To verify the correctness of the provided program, we need to scrutinize both `func_1` and `func_2` against the problem description and the given function summaries.

#### Function `func_1`:

- **Objective**: To count the number of beautiful pairs `(i, j)` where `1 ≤ i < j ≤ n` such that `(a_i + a_j) % x == 0` and `(a_i - a_j) % y == 0`.

- **Approach**:
  - The function iterates through the array `arr` and for each element `a`, it calculates `rx` and `ry` which are the remainders that would make a pair with `a` a beautiful pair.
  - The condition `(a_i + a_j) % x == 0` translates to `(a_i % x + a_j % x) % x == 0`. Since `a_i % x + a_j % x` should be divisible by `x`, we can rewrite it as `(a_i % x) == (-a_j % x + x) % x`.
  - Similarly, the condition `(a_i - a_j) % y == 0` translates to `(a_i % y == a_j % y)`.
  - The function uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a_i % x, a_i % y)` encountered so far.
  - For each element `a`, it checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`. If it does, it increments the count by the frequency of that pair.
  - It then updates the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in the dictionary.

- **Verification**:
  - The logic for calculating `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x` is correct. This ensures that `rx` is always a non-negative integer within the range `[0, x-1]`.
  - The logic for checking if a pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq` and incrementing the count accordingly is also correct.
  - The update of the frequency dictionary is correct as well.

#### Function `func_2`:

- **Objective**: To read input, parse it into test cases, and call `func_1` to compute the results for each test case.

- **Approach**:
  - The function reads the input from standard input, splits it into lines, and processes each test case.
  - For each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
  - It then calls `func_1` with the list of test cases and prints the results.

- **Verification**:
  - The parsing logic is correct. It correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
  - The function correctly passes the list of test cases to `func_1` and prints the results.

### Conclusion:

Both `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly implemented according to the problem description. The logic for determining beautiful pairs in `func_1` is sound, and the input parsing and result printing in `func_2` are accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
