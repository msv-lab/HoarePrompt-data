### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the logic of `func_1` to ensure it correctly identifies beautiful pairs according to the problem statement.

#### Key Logic in `func_1`:
1. **Calculation of `rx` and `ry`**:
   - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` is used to ensure that `-a % x` is non-negative. This is necessary because Python's modulo operation can return negative results.
   - `ry = a % y` is straightforward and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Frequency Dictionary `freq`**:
   - The frequency dictionary `freq` keeps track of how many times each pair `(a % x, a % y)` has been seen.
   - The logic `if (rx, ry) in freq: count += freq[rx, ry]` suggests that for each element `a`, the program checks how many times the pair `(rx, ry)` has been seen before. This is intended to count the number of previous elements that can form a beautiful pair with the current element `a`.

3. **Updating the Frequency Dictionary**:
   - The current pair `(a % x, a % y)` is then added to the frequency dictionary.

#### Verification of Logic:
1. **Correctness of `rx` Calculation**:
   - The calculation of `rx` ensures that the result is non-negative, which is necessary for correctly checking if `a[i] + a[j]` is divisible by `x`.

2. **Correctness of `ry` Calculation**:
   - The calculation of `ry` is straightforward and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Frequency Dictionary Usage**:
   - The frequency dictionary is used to efficiently count the number of beautiful pairs by checking if the complement pair `(rx, ry)` has been seen before.
   - However, there is a subtle issue with the logic. The program checks for `(rx, ry)` in the frequency dictionary, which corresponds to the condition `a[i] + a[j]` being divisible by `x` and `a[i] - a[j]` being divisible by `y`. But the condition `a[i] + a[j]` being divisible by `x` translates to `(a[i] % x + a[j] % x) % x == 0`, which is not directly checked by `(rx, ry)`. Instead, `rx` should be `(x - a % x) % x` to correctly represent the condition `a[i] + a[j]` being divisible by `x`.

#### Correcting the Logic:
- The correct way to check for the condition `a[i] + a[j]` being divisible by `x` is to use `(x - a % x) % x` for `rx`. This ensures that `rx` correctly represents the required condition.
- The current implementation uses `(-a % x + x) % x`, which is equivalent to `(x - a % x) % x` and is correct for the condition `a[i] + a[j]` being divisible by `x`.

Given the above analysis, the logic in `func_1` is indeed correct. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
