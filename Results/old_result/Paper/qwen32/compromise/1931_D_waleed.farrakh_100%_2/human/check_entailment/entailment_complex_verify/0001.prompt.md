You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

The function returns a list of these counts, one for each test case. If the input list of test cases is empty, the function returns an empty list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that it accurately computes the number of beautiful pairs in the array `a` for each test case. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function processes each test case and calculates the number of beautiful pairs. It uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a_i % x, a_i % y)` as it iterates through the array. For each element `a` in the array, it calculates the required remainders `rx` and `ry` that would make a pair with the current element `a` a beautiful pair. The condition for a pair `(i, j)` to be beautiful is that `(a_i + a_j) % x == 0` and `(a_i - a_j) % y == 0`. This can be transformed into checking if there exists a previous element `a_i` such that `(a_i % x, a_i % y)` matches `((-a_j % x + x) % x, a_j % y)`. If such a pair exists, it increments the count by the frequency of that pair. It then updates the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads the input from standard input, parses it into test cases, and calls `func_1` to compute the results. It then prints the results for each test case.

The logic in `func_1` is correct for determining the number of beautiful pairs. The use of the dictionary `freq` ensures that the solution is efficient, with a time complexity of O(n) for each test case, which is suitable given the constraints (the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5).

The parsing and handling of input in `func_2` also appear to be correct based on the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
