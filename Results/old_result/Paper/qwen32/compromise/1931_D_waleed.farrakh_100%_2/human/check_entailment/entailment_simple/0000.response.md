### Reasoning:

The given Python program consists of two main functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. The program reads input data, processes each test case, and prints the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

1. **Function `func_2`**:
    - This function reads the input from standard input.
    - It parses the number of test cases (`t`).
    - For each test case, it extracts the values `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
    - It stores these values in a list of tuples called `test_cases`.
    - It then calls `func_1` with `test_cases` as an argument.
    - After receiving the results from `func_1`, it prints each result.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
    - This function takes a list of test cases as input.
    - For each test case `(n, x, y, arr)`, it initializes an empty dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
    - It initializes a counter `count` to zero.
    - For each element `a` in the array `arr`, it calculates `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` as `a % y`.
    - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the `freq` dictionary. If it is, it adds the frequency of this pair to `count`.
    - It then updates the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in the `freq` dictionary.
    - After processing all elements in the array, it appends the final count for the current test case to the `results` list.
    - Finally, it returns the `results` list.

### Verification:

The logic in `func_1` is correct for the problem description. Here's a step-by-step verification:

- The calculation of `rx` ensures that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` by considering the negative modulo.
- The calculation of `ry` ensures that `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
- The use of a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequencies of pairs `(a % x, a % y)` allows efficient counting of beautiful pairs.
- The program correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
