The code snippet appends a new tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the existing list `test_cases`. None of the other variables (`input`, `data`, `t`, `idx`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`) are modified by the code. Therefore, the updated state includes the new tuple in `test_cases`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list containing two tuples `((n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr))`; `input` is a string containing the entire input; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a line from the `input`; `t` is 1; `idx` is 3; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from splitting and converting `data[3]` to integers; `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values from `data[4]` to integers.**
