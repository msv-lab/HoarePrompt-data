The code snippet provided appends the value of `count` to the `results` list. The other variables (`test_cases`, `freq`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer), `x` (an integer), `y` (an integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers); `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each unique pair `(a % x, a % y)` encountered in `arr`; `count` is the sum of the frequencies of the pairs `(rx, ry)` encountered during the iterations.**
