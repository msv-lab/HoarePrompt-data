Functionality: **The function processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n`, two favorite integers `x` and `y`, and an array `arr` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a count based on the frequency of certain pairs derived from the elements of `arr` and the values of `x` and `y`. The function returns a list of these counts, one for each test case. If the input list of test cases is empty, the function returns an empty list.**
