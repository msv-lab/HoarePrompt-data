Postcondition: **`test_cases` contains at least one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` has at least one element; `results` contains the final value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary that includes the key `(rx, ry)`; `count` is 0; `rx` is `(-arr[0] % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `arr[0] % y`. The current value of `(rx, ry)` is a key in the `freq` dictionary.**
