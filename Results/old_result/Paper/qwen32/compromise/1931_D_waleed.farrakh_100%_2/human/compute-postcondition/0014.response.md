The value of `idx` is incremented by 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list containing two tuples `((n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr))`; `input` is a string containing the entire input; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a line from the `input`; `t` is 1; `idx` is 5; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from splitting and converting `data[3]` to integers; `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values from `data[4]` to integers.**
