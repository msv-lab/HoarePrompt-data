Output State: **`test_cases` is an empty list. `input` is a string containing the entire input. `data` is a list of strings, each representing a line from the `input`. `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of `data[0]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet only initializes an empty list `test_cases` and does not modify any other variables. Therefore, the values of `input`, `data`, and `t` remain unchanged.
