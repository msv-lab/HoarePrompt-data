Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer representing the size of the array), `x` (an integer representing Polycarp's first favorite integer), `y` (an integer representing Polycarp's second favorite integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers representing the elements of the array). `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    freq = {}
    count = 0
    for a in arr:
        rx = (-a % x + x) % x
        ry = a % y
        if (rx, ry) in freq:
            count += freq[rx, ry]
        current_pair = a % x, a % y
        if current_pair in freq:
            freq[current_pair] += 1
        else:
            freq[current_pair] = 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer), `x` (an integer), `y` (an integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers); `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each unique pair `(a % x, a % y)` encountered in `arr`; `count` is the sum of the frequencies of the pairs `(rx, ry)` encountered during the iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` contains the final value of `count`, `freq` contains the frequency of all pairs `(a % x, a % y)` encountered, `count` is the total count of pairs `(rx, ry)` found in `freq`, and `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` reflect the values of the last tuple in the original `test_cases` list. The `results` list now includes the final value of `count`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` contains at least one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` has `n` elements; `results` contains the final value of `count` which is the sum of all previous occurrences of each `(rx, ry)` pair encountered, and now includes the new value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each unique `(a % x, a % y)` pair in `arr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
