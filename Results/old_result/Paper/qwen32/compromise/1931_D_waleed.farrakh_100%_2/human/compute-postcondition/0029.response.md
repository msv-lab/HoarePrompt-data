Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), integers `x` and `y` (where 1 <= x, y <= 10^9), and a list `arr` of `n` integers (where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided constraints and relationships.**
