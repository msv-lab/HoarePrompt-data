You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17

    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of three integers n, a, and b (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9) where n is the number of buns, a is the usual price of a bun, and b is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum profit for all test cases. Let's analyze the logic and identify the potential issue.

The program attempts to determine the maximum profit by considering three scenarios:
1. If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, all buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
2. If the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, all buns are sold at the modified price, and the sum of the modified prices is calculated.
3. Otherwise, it calculates the profit by selling `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining at the usual price.

However, there is a logical error in the third scenario. The program does not correctly determine the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit. Instead, it incorrectly calculates the profit by using `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n`, which is not the correct formula to determine the maximum profit for a given `k`.

To correctly determine the maximum profit, we need to iterate through possible values of `k` (from 0 to `n`) and calculate the profit for each `k`. The correct approach involves calculating the sum of the first `k` modified prices and adding the profit from the remaining buns sold at the usual price `a`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        
        for k in range(n + 1):
            # Calculate profit for selling k buns at modified price
            modified_price_profit = sum(b - i for i in range(k))
            # Calculate profit for selling remaining buns at usual price
            usual_price_profit = (n - k) * a
            # Total profit for this k
            total_profit = modified_price_profit + usual_price_profit
            # Update max_profit if the current total_profit is higher
            max_profit = max(max_profit, total_profit)
        
        print(max_profit)

# Example usage
# func()
```

This corrected version iterates through all possible values of `k`, calculates the profit for each, and keeps track of the maximum profit obtained. This ensures that the program works correctly for all potential cases.
