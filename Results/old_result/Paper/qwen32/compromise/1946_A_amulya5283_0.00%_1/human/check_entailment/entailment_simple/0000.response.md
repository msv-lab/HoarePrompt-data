### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of an array. Let's analyze the approach and the logic used in the program.

1. **Sorting the Array**: The program sorts the array to easily find the median. This is correct because the median is defined based on the order of elements in the array.

2. **Finding the Median**: The median is determined by the element at the index `n // 2` (for even `n`, this is the lower middle element, but since the problem specifies the median as `ceil(n / 2)`, this is sufficient because the median for even `n` will be the larger of the two middle elements after incrementing).

3. **Using a Min-Heap**: The program uses a min-heap to efficiently find and increment the smallest elements from the median index onward. This is a valid approach because increasing the smallest values from the median onward will eventually increase the median itself.

4. **Incrementing Elements**: The program repeatedly extracts the smallest element from the heap, increments it by 1, and pushes it back into the heap. It counts the number of operations required to make the smallest element in the heap greater than the current median.

5. **Correctness of Logic**: The logic correctly identifies that to increase the median, we need to increase the smallest values from the median position onward until the smallest value in this part of the array is greater than the current median. This ensures that the median itself increases.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as arrays with a single element, arrays where all elements are the same, and arrays with an even number of elements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Therefore, the program is correct based on the given problem description and the provided examples.
