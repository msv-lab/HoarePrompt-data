Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the program only considers the median index and the elements to the right of it, which is insufficient to determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.

The median of an array is the middle element in the sorted array. For an array of odd length, it is the middle element, and for an array of even length, it is the higher of the two middle elements. The program only modifies the elements starting from the median index, which means it does not consider the need to increase elements to the left of the median if they are smaller than the current median.

For example, consider the test case:
```
1
4
3 1 2 1
```
The current median is 2 (for the sorted array [1, 1, 2, 3]). To increase the median, we need to increase one of the 1s to at least 3, which requires 2 operations. However, the program will only consider the elements starting from the median index (i.e., [2, 1, 3]) and will incorrectly conclude that it only needs 1 operation (increasing the 1 to 2).

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not handle cases where the elements to the left of the median need to be increased to properly increase the median.
