### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median of an array. Here's a detailed breakdown of the provided program and its correctness based on the problem description:

1. **Median Calculation**: The program correctly identifies the median of the array. For an array of length `n`, the median is the element at index `n // 2` in the sorted array. If `n` is odd, this is the middle element. If `n` is even, it still refers to the lower middle element in the context of the problem, as the median is defined as `ceil(n/2)`.

2. **Heap Usage**: The program uses a min-heap to efficiently track and modify the smallest elements in the array starting from the median position. This is a reasonable approach for incrementing elements to surpass the current median.

3. **Increment Operations**: The program iteratively pops the smallest element from the heap, increments it by 1, and pushes it back into the heap. It counts these operations until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median.

4. **Correctness of Operations Count**: The logic for counting the number of operations is sound. The program ensures that all elements from the median position onwards are greater than the initial median by incrementing the necessary elements.

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program processes multiple test cases as described in the input format, storing the results for each test case and printing them at the end.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as arrays of length 1 and arrays where the median is already the maximum element in the array.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The execution summary aligns with the intended functionality of the program.
