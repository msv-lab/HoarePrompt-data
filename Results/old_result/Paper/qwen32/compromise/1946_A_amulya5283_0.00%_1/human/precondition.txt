t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array a, and a list a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the array a. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
