Output State: **`heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed, `operations` is 2, `results` contains the value of `operations`, `i` is `k + 1`, `t` is `t`, `n` and `arr` are assigned the values from `test_cases[k + 1]` with `arr` sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` must be greater than or equal to `smallest + 1`, `smallest` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before the operation and has now been removed from `heap`.**

In simple terms, the smallest element has been removed from `heap`, and `smallest` now holds the value of that element. All other variables remain unchanged.
