To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all possible iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the `heap` and `operations` variables.

### Loop Analysis

The loop continues as long as the smallest element in the `heap` is less than or equal to the `current_median`. When this condition is met, the smallest element is removed from the `heap`, incremented by 1, and then pushed back into the `heap`. Each time this operation is performed, `operations` is incremented by 1.

### Key Observations

1. **Heap Property**: The `heap` is a min-heap, meaning the smallest element is always at the root.
2. **Median**: The `current_median` is the middle element of the sorted list `arr`. If `n` (the number of elements in `arr`) is odd, `current_median` is the middle element. If `n` is even, `current_median` is the lower middle element.
3. **Loop Termination**: The loop terminates when the smallest element in the `heap` is greater than `current_median`.

### Final Output State

The loop will continue until every element in the `heap` is greater than `current_median`. Since the `heap` initially contains elements from `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end of `arr`, and these elements are sorted in ascending order, the loop will increment the smallest elements in the `heap` until they exceed `current_median`.

- **Heap**: All elements in the `heap` will be greater than `current_median`.
- **Operations**: `operations` will be equal to the total number of increments performed to make all elements in the `heap` greater than `current_median`.

### Calculation

Let's denote the number of elements in the `heap` as `k`. Initially, `k = n - median_index`. The loop will perform an increment operation for each element in the `heap` until it is greater than `current_median`. The exact number of operations depends on the initial values and the value of `current_median`.

### Final State

The final state of the variables after the loop has executed all iterations is:

- `heap`: All elements are greater than `current_median`.
- `operations`: The total number of increments performed.

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the loop, the final state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **heap contains elements all greater than current_median, operations is the total number of increments performed to achieve this state.**

In simpler terms, the `heap` will have all its elements greater than the `current_median`, and `operations` will reflect the total number of times an element was incremented to achieve this condition.
