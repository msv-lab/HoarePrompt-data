The code snippet increments the value of `operations` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state of `operations` is 3, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and `smallest + 1` added, `operations` is 3, `results` contains the value of `operations`, `i` is `k + 1`, `t` is `t`, `n` and `arr` are assigned the values from `test_cases[k + 1]` with `arr` sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` must be greater than or equal to `smallest + 1`, `smallest` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before the operation and has now been removed from `heap`.**
