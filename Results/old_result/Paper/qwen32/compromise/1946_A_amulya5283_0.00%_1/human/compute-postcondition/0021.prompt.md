Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of n integers a_i such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the first element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of the second element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is the element at index `median_index` in `arr`; `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]`; `operations` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while heap[0] <= current_median:
    smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
    heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
    operations += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_i` such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the first element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of the second element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is the element at index `median_index` in `arr`; `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]` with one less element and now includes `smallest + 1`; `operations` is 1; `smallest` is the smallest element that was in the heap.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_i` such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the first element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of the second element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is the element at index `median_index` in `arr`; `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]` with one less element and now includes the next smallest element after the popped one plus one; `operations` is 2; `smallest` is the smallest element that was at the root of the heap.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_i` such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the first element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of the second element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is the element at index `median_index` in `arr`; `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]` with one less element and now includes the next smallest element after the popped one plus one, excluding the smallest element that was just removed, and now includes `smallest + 1`; `operations` is 3; `smallest` is the smallest element that was at the root of the heap; `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median` (assuming the heap property is maintained after the pop operation)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
