Output State: **`heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`, `operations` is 2, `results` contains the value of `operations`, `i` is `k + 1`, `t` is `t`, `n` and `arr` are assigned the values from `test_cases[k + 1]` with `arr` sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[n // 2]`, `smallest` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before the operation.**

In simple terms, the number of operations has been incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
