The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer value provided by user input (2 <= n <= 500). At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an integer value provided by user input (2 <= n <= 500), `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting the string `line`, `line` is the new string input by the user, `a` is `[1000, 1000 + T[0]]`, `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`, `i` is 2**
