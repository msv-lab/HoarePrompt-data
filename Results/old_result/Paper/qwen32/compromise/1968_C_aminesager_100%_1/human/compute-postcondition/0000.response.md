`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`n`, `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 500), `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n` are a list of n-1 integers (1 <= x_i <= 500)**.
