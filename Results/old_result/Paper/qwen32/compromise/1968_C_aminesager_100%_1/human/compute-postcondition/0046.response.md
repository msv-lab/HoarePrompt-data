To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the initial state and how the loop modifies the variables over time. The loop runs `t` times, and during each iteration, it reads a new value of `n`, a new list of integers `T`, and computes a new list `a` based on these inputs. The variable `t` is decremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, and the loop terminates when `t` becomes 0.

Let's break down the final state:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t`: An input integer representing the number of iterations.
   - `n`: An integer (2 <= n <= 500).
   - `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n`: A list of n-1 integers (1 <= x_i <= 500).

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each iteration:
     - `t` is decremented by 1.
     - `n` is read from user input.
     - `line` is read from user input.
     - `T` is derived from `line` by splitting it into a list of integers.
     - `a` is initialized to `[1000]`.
     - For `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is computed as `a[i-1] + T[i-1]`.
     - `result` is the space-separated string of the elements in `a`.
     - `result` is printed.

3. **Final State:**
   - After `t` iterations, `t` will be 0.
   - `n`, `T`, and `a` will be based on the last iteration's inputs.
   - The final `result` will be the space-separated string of the elements in `a` from the last iteration.

Given the loop's behavior, the final output state will be:

- `t` will be 0.
- `n`, `T`, and `a` will reflect the values from the last iteration.
- The output will be the `result` from the last iteration.

Since the problem does not specify the exact values of `n` and `T` for the last iteration, we can only describe the final state in terms of the last iteration's inputs. Therefore, the output state after all iterations will be:

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the integer value provided by user input in the last iteration (2 <= n <= 500), `T` is the list of integers derived from splitting the string `line` in the last iteration, `a` is `[1000, 1000 + T[0], (1000 + T[0]) + T[1], ..., 1000 + sum(T[0] to T[n-2])]`, and `result` is the space-separated string of the elements in `a` from the last iteration.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes, `t` will be 0, `n` and `T` will be the values from the last iteration, and the output will be the final computed list `a` as a space-separated string.
