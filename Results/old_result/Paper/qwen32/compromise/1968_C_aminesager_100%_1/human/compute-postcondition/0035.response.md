The provided code snippet updates the list `T` by mapping the integers from the newly input string `line`. This means `T` will now contain the integers derived from splitting the new `line`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1
- `n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 500)
- `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting the string `line`
- `line` is the new string input by the user
- `a` is a list calculated based on the initial `T`
- `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`

After executing the code `T = list(map(int, line.split()))`, `T` is updated to the new list of integers from the new `line`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `result` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 500), `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting the new string `line`, `line` is the new string input by the user, `a` is [1000, 1000 + T[0], (1000 + T[0]) + T[1], ..., (1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]) + T[n-1]], `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`**
