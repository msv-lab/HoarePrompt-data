Let's reason through the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to determine the maximum possible value that can be achieved in the array after performing the given operations. The operations allow us to choose a subarray, find its median, and set all elements in that subarray to that median value. The process continues until all elements in the array are the same.

### Key Insight

The key observation is that the maximum value that can be achieved in the array is the median of any subarray of length 3. This is because the median of a subarray of length 3 is the middle element when the subarray is sorted. By repeatedly applying the operation to subarrays of length 3, we can eventually make the entire array equal to the maximum median found in any subarray of length 3.

### Explanation of the Program

The provided program follows this insight. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.
2. **Handling Small Arrays**: If the array length is 2, the program directly prints the minimum of the two elements, as this is the only possible median.
3. **Finding Maximum Median**: For arrays longer than 2, the program iterates over all possible subarrays of length 3, calculates their medians, and keeps track of the maximum median found.
4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the maximum median for each test case.

### Correctness Check

The program correctly implements the logic based on the key insight. It handles the edge case where the array length is 2 and correctly finds the maximum median for longer arrays. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **True**
