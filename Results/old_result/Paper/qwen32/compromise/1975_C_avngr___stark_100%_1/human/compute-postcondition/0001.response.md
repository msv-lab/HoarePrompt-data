The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in Python to indicate that the loop variable is intentionally unused. The loop will execute `t` times if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is already given as an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), no adjustment is needed for `_` as it is not used in the loop body. The only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `t` is within the specified range to allow the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500)**

Since `t` is already defined within the specified range, no further adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.
