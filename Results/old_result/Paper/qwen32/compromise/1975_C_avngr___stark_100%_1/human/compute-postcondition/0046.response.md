The code snippet `temp = a[i:i + 3]` slices the list `a` starting from index `i` up to but not including index `i + 3`, and assigns this slice to the variable `temp`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The variable `temp` is now a new list containing the elements from `a` at positions `i`, `i + 1`, and `i + 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (0 ≤ t ≤ 499), `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `i` is `i + 1`, `temp` is a list containing the elements `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, and `a[i + 2]`.**
