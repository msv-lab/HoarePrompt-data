The `continue` statement in Python does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables `t`, `n`, or `a`.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500); `n` is an input integer, and the current value of `n` is 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
