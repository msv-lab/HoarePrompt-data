The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` would have been incremented by 1. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we only need to adjust `_`.

Given that `_` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, if `_` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration. The other variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `max` do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head.

Let's assume `_` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration. Then at the start of the next iteration, `_` will be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (0 ≤ t ≤ 499), `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, and `max` is the maximum value of the second smallest element in any triplet of consecutive elements in `a`. `_` is `x + 1`**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `x` from the previous iteration, we can just denote the new value of `_` as `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (0 ≤ t ≤ 499), `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, and `max` is the maximum value of the second smallest element in any triplet of consecutive elements in `a`. `_` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration.**

For a more concrete example, if `_` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `_` will be 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (0 ≤ t ≤ 499), `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, and `max` is the maximum value of the second smallest element in any triplet of consecutive elements in `a`. `_` is 1**.

But generally, we denote it as:

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (0 ≤ t ≤ 499), `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, and `max` is the maximum value of the second smallest element in any triplet of consecutive elements in `a`. `_` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration.**
