The code snippet `temp = a[i:i + 3]` updates the value of `temp` to be a slice of the list `a` starting at index `i` and ending at `i + 3`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `temp` will be updated to the sublist of `a` from index 1 to index 4 (not inclusive).

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (0 ≤ t ≤ 499), `n` is 3, `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the new input, `_` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, `temp` is `a[1:4]`, `max` remains unchanged.**

In natural language: The variable `temp` is now the sublist of `a` from index 1 to 3. All other variables retain their previous values.
