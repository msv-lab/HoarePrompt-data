Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (0 ≤ t ≤ 499), `n` is 3, `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the new input, `_` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, `temp` is the sorted list `a[1:4]`. If `temp[1]` (the second smallest element in `a[1:4]`) is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to be the second smallest element in `a[1:4]`. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.**
