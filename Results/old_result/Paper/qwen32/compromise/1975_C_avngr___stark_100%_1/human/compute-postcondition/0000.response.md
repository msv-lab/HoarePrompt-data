Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500). The initial state for the array length `n` and the array elements `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remains unchanged as the code snippet only reads the number of test cases.**

This means that the variable `t` now holds the number of test cases, while the information about the array length `n` and the array elements `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is still pending to be input and is not yet affected by the given code snippet.
