The code snippet provided initializes an empty deque named `tree`. This action does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, or the structure of the tree represented by the edges. The starting node for each round, represented by the list of integers `(u_1, ..., u_t)`, also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `tree` is an empty deque.**
