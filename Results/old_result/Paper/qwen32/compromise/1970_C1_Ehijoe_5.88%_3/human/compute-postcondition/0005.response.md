The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `start`. The previous state of `tree` and `empty` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`tree` is a deque containing all `n` nodes in a single path from one leaf to the other, `empty` is False, `start` is an input integer.**
