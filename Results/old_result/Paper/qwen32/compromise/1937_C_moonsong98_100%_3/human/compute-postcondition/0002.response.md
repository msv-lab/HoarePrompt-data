To determine the output state, we need to understand the function `func_2` and how it affects the variables. However, since the function `func_2` is not provided in the code snippet, we can only infer that it is called with the arguments `0` and `1`, but we cannot determine its internal behavior or how it affects the variables `n` or any other variables.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, and without additional information about `func_2`, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not directly modified in the provided code.

Output State: **`n` is 2.**
