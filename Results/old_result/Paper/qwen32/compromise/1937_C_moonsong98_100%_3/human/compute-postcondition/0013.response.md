To determine the output state, let's analyze the given loop and the conditions:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2.
   - `max_index` is `n-1`.
   - `min_indices` is a list containing all indices that are considered equal to `max_index` by `func_1`.
   - `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices`.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `i` in `min_indices`.
   - If `i` is equal to `max_index`, the loop skips the current iteration using `continue`.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` and checks the result.
   - If the result of `func_1` is `'='`, it updates `min_index` to `i`.

3. **Key Points:**
   - The loop only modifies `min_index` based on the results of `func_1`.
   - If `i` is not `max_index` and `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` returns `'='`, `min_index` is set to `i`.
   - Since `min_indices` contains indices that are considered equal to `max_index` by `func_1`, and the loop skips `max_index`, the only way `min_index` can change is if there is another index `i` in `min_indices` (other than `max_index`) for which `func_1` returns `'='`.

Given these points, the loop will iterate through all indices in `min_indices` and update `min_index` only if `func_1` returns `'='` for some index `i` other than `max_index`. If no such index exists, `min_index` remains unchanged.

**Output State:**
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `max_index` remains unchanged.
- `min_indices` remains unchanged.
- `min_index` will either remain the same (if no other index in `min_indices` causes `func_1` to return `'='`) or be updated to the first index `i` in `min_indices` (other than `max_index`) for which `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` returns `'='`.

Since the problem does not specify the behavior of `func_1` or provide more details about the contents of `min_indices`, we can only conclude that `min_index` will be updated based on the condition described.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2; `max_index` is n-1; `min_indices` is a list containing all indices that are considered equal to `max_index` by `func_1`; `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices` or the first index `i` in `min_indices` (other than `max_index`) for which `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` returns `'='`.**
