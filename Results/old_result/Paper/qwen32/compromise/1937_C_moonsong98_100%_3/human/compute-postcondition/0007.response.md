To determine the output state, we need to analyze the loop and the function `func_1`. However, the function `func_1` is not provided, and its behavior is crucial to determine the final value of `max_index`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(0, n):
    res = func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)
    if res == '<':
        max_index = i
```

Let's assume `func_1` returns `<` when the fourth argument `i` is less than the second argument `max_index` (this is a common behavior for comparison functions).

1. Initially, `max_index` is 0.
2. In the first iteration (`i = 0`), `res = func_1(0, 0, 0, 0)`. If `func_1` returns anything other than `<`, `max_index` remains 0.
3. In the second iteration (`i = 1`), `res = func_1(0, 0, 0, 1)`. If `func_1` returns `<`, `max_index` would be updated to 1.
4. In subsequent iterations, `max_index` will only be updated if `func_1` returns `<` for the current `i`.

If `func_1` consistently returns `<` for all `i > 0`, `max_index` will be updated to the last value of `i` in the loop, which is `n-1`.

However, without knowing the exact behavior of `func_1`, we can only make assumptions. Let's assume `func_1` behaves as described above and returns `<` for all `i > 0`.

Therefore, the final value of `max_index` would be `n-1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2; `max_index` is n-1.**
