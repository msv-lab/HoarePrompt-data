The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state provides information about two variables, `n` and `k`, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state mentions that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
2. It also states that the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`.
3. The `print` statement is `print(1)`, which directly outputs the integer `1`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference `n` or `k`, their values do not influence the output.

Output: **1**
