The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `h`. The other variables `n`, `k`, and `costs` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, and `n` is not equal to `k`. Additionally, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. `costs` is a list containing `[n - k + 1, 1]`. `h` is 0.**
