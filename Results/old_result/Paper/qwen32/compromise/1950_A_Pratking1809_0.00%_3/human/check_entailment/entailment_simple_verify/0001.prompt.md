You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: - The values of `t`, `mn`, and the state of any variables not involved in the loop remain unchanged.
    #   - The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the values from the last iteration of the loop, as they are overwritten in each iteration.
    #   - The loop prints 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each iteration based on the input values, but these print statements do not affect the state of the variables.
    #
    #Given the above analysis, the output state will be:
    #
    #Output State:



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The given program is intended to determine whether a set of three digits forms a "stair", a "peak", or neither, based on the conditions provided in the problem description. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`, from the input.
2. It then enters a loop that will process each test case.
3. For each test case, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
4. It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a "stair". If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR".
5. It checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a "peak". If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK".
6. If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints "NONE".

The logic in the program correctly identifies the conditions for a "stair" and a "peak" and handles the case where neither condition is met. 

However, there is a logical error in the `else` clause. The `else` clause is currently associated with the second `if` statement (checking for a "peak"), which means it will print "NONE" whenever the digits do not form a "peak", even if they form a "stair". To fix this, the `else` clause should be associated with the first `if` statement (checking for a "stair"). We can do this by using `elif` for the second condition.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

Since the original program does not have this correction, it will incorrectly print "NONE" for cases that should print "STAIR". Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
