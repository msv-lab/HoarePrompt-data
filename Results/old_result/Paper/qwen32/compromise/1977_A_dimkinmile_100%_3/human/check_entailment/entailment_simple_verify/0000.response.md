### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies the logic needed to determine whether it is possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The key condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is accurately explained and matches the problem requirements.

1. **`(n - m) % 2 == 0`**: This ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even. Since each move changes the number of cubes by 1, an even difference means that we can reach `m` cubes from 0 cubes by an even number of moves.
2. **`n - m >= 0`**: This ensures that the number of moves is sufficient to reach the desired number of cubes, as we cannot end up with more cubes than the number of moves.

The annotated code confirms that the program reads the input correctly, processes each test case by checking the condition, and prints the correct output based on the condition.

### Verification with Examples:
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 3`, `m = 3` -> `(3 - 3) % 2 == 0` and `3 - 3 >= 0` -> "Yes"
- **Test Case 2**: `n = 2`, `m = 4` -> `(2 - 4) % 2 != 0` -> "No"
- **Test Case 3**: `n = 5`, `m = 3` -> `(5 - 3) % 2 == 0` and `5 - 3 >= 0` -> "Yes"

These examples match the expected output, and the program's behavior aligns with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases based on the problem description. There are no edge cases or inputs that the program fails to handle correctly.

**Final: True**
