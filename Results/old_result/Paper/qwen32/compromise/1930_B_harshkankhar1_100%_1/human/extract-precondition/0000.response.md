Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) — the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the length of the permutation p. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
