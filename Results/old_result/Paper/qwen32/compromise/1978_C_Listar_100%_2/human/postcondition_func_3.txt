The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input. It returns `(0, 0)` if `k` is odd or if `k` is greater than the maximum possible value of `k` based on `n`. Otherwise, it returns the tuple `(n, k)` where `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative even integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
