Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly in the way it calculates and constructs permutations to achieve the desired Manhattan value `k`.

### Issues:
1. **Handling of Odd `k` Values**: The program immediately returns `(0, 0)` if `k` is odd, which is incorrect. The Manhattan value can indeed be odd for certain permutations. For example, a permutation of length 2 can have a Manhattan value of 1, as shown in the example with `n=2` and `k=1` (permutation `[2, 1]`).

2. **Maximum `k` Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` as `(n^2 - 1) // 2` for odd `n` and `n^2 // 2` for even `n`. However, this calculation is incorrect. The maximum Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is actually `n * (n - 1) // 2`. This is because the maximum deviation for each element `p_i` from its position `i` is `n - 1`, and there are `n` elements, but the sum of deviations is maximized when each element is placed at the opposite end, leading to a sum of `n * (n - 1) // 2`.

3. **Permutation Construction**: The logic in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` for constructing the permutation to achieve the desired Manhattan value `k` is not robust and may not cover all cases. The approach seems to be based on swapping elements to increase the Manhattan value, but it does not guarantee that it can achieve every possible `k` value.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the case `n=2` and `k=1`. The correct output should be:
```
YES
2 1
```
However, the program will return `NO` because it incorrectly handles odd `k` values.

### Conclusion:
Given these issues, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.
