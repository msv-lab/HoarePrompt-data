Let's analyze the given program and determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that its Manhattan value is equal to \( k \).
- The Manhattan value of a permutation \( p \) is calculated as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} |p_i - i| \).
- If no such permutation exists, we should output "No". Otherwise, we should output "Yes" followed by the permutation.

### Analysis of the Program:

#### Function 4 (`func_4`):
- This function reads input values \( n \) and \( k \).
- It checks if \( k \) is odd. If so, it returns `(0, 0)` because the Manhattan value of any permutation is always even.
- It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length \( n \):
  - If \( n \) is odd, the maximum Manhattan value is \( \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \).
  - If \( n \) is even, the maximum Manhattan value is \( \frac{n^2}{2} \).
- If \( k \) exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value, it returns `(0, 0)`.
- Otherwise, it returns the pair `(n, k)`.

#### Function 1 (`func_1`):
- This function attempts to construct a permutation with the given Manhattan value \( k \).
- It divides \( k \) by 2 because the Manhattan value is always even.
- It initializes a list `l` as the identity permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
- It then iterates from \( n \) down to 2, adjusting the permutation to increase the Manhattan value.
- If \( k \) becomes 0, it returns the current permutation.
- If \( k \) is less than the current gap, it calls `func_2` to adjust the permutation.
- It updates \( k \) and calls `func_3` to swap elements in the permutation.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`):
- This function swaps two elements in the permutation to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
- It swaps the elements at positions `-c` and `-c - k` in the list `l`.

#### Function 3 (`func_3`):
- This function swaps two elements in the permutation.
- It swaps the elements at positions `c - 1` and `-c` in the list `l`.

#### Function 5 (`func_5`):
- This function prints "YES" followed by the permutation.

#### Function 6 (`func_6`):
- This function orchestrates the process:
  - It calls `func_4` to read input and validate \( k \).
  - If `func_4` returns `(0, 0)`, it prints "NO".
  - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then `func_5` to print it.

### Issues and Corrections:
1. **Even \( k \) Check**: The program correctly checks if \( k \) is odd, but the logic for constructing the permutation is not well-explained or verified for correctness.
2. **Maximum \( k \) Calculation**: The maximum Manhattan value calculation is correct.
3. **Permutation Construction**: The logic in `func_1` for constructing the permutation is complex and not clearly justified. The approach of dividing \( k \) by 2 and iteratively adjusting the permutation is not straightforward and may not guarantee a correct permutation for all valid \( k \).

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for constructing the permutation is not explained or verified for correctness, and the approach may not work for all valid inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program cannot be guaranteed based on the provided code.

**Correctness: False**
