You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

    #State: 
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `n` (a positive integer between 1 and 200,000) and `k` (a non-negative integer between 0 and 1 trillion). It returns a list `l` which is initially a range from 1 to `n`. The function modifies this list based on the value of `k` and returns it. If `k` is reduced to zero during the process, the current state of the list `l` is returned. If `k` is less than `i - 1` at any point, the function calls `func_2` with the current count `c`, the remaining `k`, and the list `l`. The list `l` is also modified by calling `func_3` with the count `c` in each iteration of the loop. The final state of the program is the returned list `l` after all modifications.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: c and k are non-negative integers, and l is a list of integers with a length sufficient to support indexing with -c and -c-k without going out of bounds.
def func_2(c, k, l):
    x, y = l[-c], l[-c - k]

    return l
    #The program returns the list `l` which contains integers and has a length sufficient to support indexing with `-c` and `-c-k` without going out of bounds.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes three parameters: `c` and `k`, which are non-negative integers, and `l`, which is a list of integers. It swaps the elements at the positions `-c` and `-c-k` in the list `l` and returns the modified list.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a positive integer, and l is a list of integers such that 0 < c <= len(l).
def func_3(c, l):
    x, y = l[-c], l[c - 1]
    l[c - 1], l[-c] = x, y
    return l
    #The program returns the list `l` of integers such that 0 < `c` <= len(`l`).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `c` and a list of integers `l` such that `0 < c <= len(l)`. It returns the list `l` with the elements at positions `c-1` and `-c` swapped.

    #The program returns a tuple containing the positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and the even non-negative integer `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12), where `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input. It returns `(0, 0)` if `k` is odd or if `k` is greater than the maximum possible value of `k` based on `n`. Otherwise, it returns the tuple `(n, k)` where `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative even integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.

    print()
    #This is printed: (newline)
    return
    #The program returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts a list `l` of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, where each integer is distinct and in the range from 1 to `n`. It prints the integers in the list `l` in the same order, separated by spaces, followed by a newline. The function returns `None`.

#Function 6:

        #The program returns None
    #State: `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`. `n` is not equal to 0.
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_5(l)
    return
    #The program returns nothing (None)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` retrieves values `n` and `k` from `func_4()`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and returns `None`. Otherwise, it processes these values using `func_1(n, k)` and then calls `func_5()` with the result, ultimately returning `None`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly in the way it calculates and constructs permutations to achieve the desired Manhattan value `k`.

### Issues:
1. **Handling of Odd `k` Values**: The program immediately returns `(0, 0)` if `k` is odd, which is incorrect. The Manhattan value can indeed be odd for certain permutations. For example, a permutation of length 2 can have a Manhattan value of 1, as shown in the example with `n=2` and `k=1` (permutation `[2, 1]`).

2. **Maximum `k` Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` as `(n^2 - 1) // 2` for odd `n` and `n^2 // 2` for even `n`. However, this calculation is incorrect. The maximum Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is actually `n * (n - 1) // 2`. This is because the maximum deviation for each element `p_i` from its position `i` is `n - 1`, and there are `n` elements, but the sum of deviations is maximized when each element is placed at the opposite end, leading to a sum of `n * (n - 1) // 2`.

3. **Permutation Construction**: The logic in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` for constructing the permutation to achieve the desired Manhattan value `k` is not robust and may not cover all cases. The approach seems to be based on swapping elements to increase the Manhattan value, but it does not guarantee that it can achieve every possible `k` value.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the case `n=2` and `k=1`. The correct output should be:
```
YES
2 1
```
However, the program will return `NO` because it incorrectly handles odd `k` values.

### Conclusion:
Given these issues, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.
