You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 6 : The function `func_6` retrieves values `n` and `k` from `func_4()`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and returns `None`. Otherwise, it processes these values using `func_1(n, k)` and then calls `func_5()` with the result, ultimately returning `None`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify if it correctly solves the problem of finding a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value equal to `k`, or determining that no such permutation exists.

Let's break down the program and analyze its logic step by step:

### Key Points of the Problem:
1. **Manhattan Value Calculation**: The Manhattan value of a permutation `p` is the sum of `|p_i - i|` for all `i` from 1 to `n`.
2. **Objective**: For given `n` and `k`, find a permutation `p` such that the Manhattan value is `k` or determine that no such permutation exists.
3. **Constraints**: `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4` (number of test cases), `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5` (length of permutation), `0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12` (required Manhattan value).

### Program Analysis:

#### Function 4 (`func_4`):
- Reads `n` and `k` from the input.
- Checks if `k` is odd. If it is, it returns `(0, 0)` because the Manhattan value of any permutation is always even.
- Calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`. This is `(n^2 - 1) // 2` if `n` is odd and `n^2 // 2` if `n` is even.
- If `k` is greater than the maximum possible Manhattan value, it returns `(0, 0)`.
- Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

#### Function 1 (`func_1`):
- This function is responsible for constructing the permutation.
- It divides `k` by 2 (since the Manhattan value is always even).
- It initializes the list `l` as a permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
- It iterates from `n` down to `1` in steps of 2, adjusting the permutation to increase the Manhattan value.
- If `k` becomes `0`, it returns the current permutation.
- If `k` is less than `i - 1`, it calls `func_2` to make the final adjustments.
- It calls `func_3` to swap elements and increase the Manhattan value.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`):
- Swaps two elements in the list to adjust the Manhattan value to the exact value of `k`.

#### Function 3 (`func_3`):
- Swaps two elements in the list to increase the Manhattan value.

#### Function 5 (`func_5`):
- Prints "YES" and the permutation if a valid permutation is found.

#### Function 6 (`func_6`):
- Calls `func_4` to get `n` and `k`.
- If `n` is `0` (indicating no valid permutation exists), it prints "NO".
- Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to get the permutation and prints it using `func_5`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Even Manhattan Value**: The program correctly checks if `k` is even. If not, it returns "NO".
- **Maximum Manhattan Value**: The program correctly calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`.
- **Permutation Construction**: The program attempts to construct a permutation by iteratively swapping elements to increase the Manhattan value. However, the logic for swapping and adjusting `k` is complex and not straightforward to verify without a detailed mathematical proof.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases like `n = 1` and `k = 0` correctly.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided code and problem constraints, the program appears to have a logical approach to solving the problem. However, without a detailed mathematical proof of the correctness of the permutation construction logic, it is challenging to conclusively state that the program is correct for all possible inputs. Given the complexity and the absence of a formal proof, we should consider the possibility of edge cases or specific input scenarios where the program might fail.

Thus, while the program seems to follow a logical approach, we cannot definitively state its correctness without further rigorous testing and proof.
