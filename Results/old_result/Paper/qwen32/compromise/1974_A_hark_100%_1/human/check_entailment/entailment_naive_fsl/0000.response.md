Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code contains a logical error and a syntax error. The function `func_1()` is called before it is defined, which will lead to a `NameError` during execution. Moreover, the logic for calculating the minimum number of screens is incorrect.

Let's analyze the logic of the provided code:
1. It calculates `bxsfory` as the number of screens needed for `2x2` icons, assuming that each screen can fit up to 2 `2x2` icons (which is correct).
2. It then adjusts the number of `1x1` icons by subtracting the space occupied by the `2x2` icons (`bxsfory * 15`), where `15` is the number of `1x1` cells occupied by `2x2` icons (4 cells per icon, but it seems to be treating it as 15 for some reason).
3. It then calculates `bxsfory1` as the number of screens needed for the remaining `1x1` icons.
4. The final result is the sum of screens needed for `2x2` and `1x1` icons.

The main issue is the incorrect handling of the remaining `1x1` icons after placing `2x2` icons. The code incorrectly subtracts `bxsfory * 15` from `x` instead of `bxsfory * 4`. This can lead to incorrect calculations.

Let's consider a test case:
- Input: `x = 13, y = 2`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Actual Output: `3`

Explanation of the test case:
- For `y = 2`, we need `1` screen to place both `2x2` icons (since each screen can fit up to 2 `2x2` icons).
- After placing `2x2` icons, we have `13 - 2*4 = 5` `1x1` icons left.
- We need `1` more screen to place the remaining `5` `1x1` icons (since each screen can fit up to `15` `1x1` icons, but we only need `1` screen for `5` icons).

However, the code incorrectly calculates the remaining `1x1` icons as `13 - 2*15 = -17`, which leads to an incorrect result.

Thus, the code is incorrect.
