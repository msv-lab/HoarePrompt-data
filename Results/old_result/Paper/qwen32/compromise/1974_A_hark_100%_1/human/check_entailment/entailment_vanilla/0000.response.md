Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to determine the minimum number of 5x3 screens required to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons. Each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns).

### Key Observations:
1. **2x2 Icons**: Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. Since a 5x3 screen can fit a maximum of 2 non-overlapping 2x2 icons (as placing 3 would require 12 cells, leaving no space for the 15th cell), we need at least `ceil(y / 2)` screens to place all 2x2 icons.
2. **Remaining Cells**: After placing the 2x2 icons, the remaining cells can be used to place 1x1 icons. Each screen can fit up to 15 cells. If `y` is even, we can place `y / 2` 2x2 icons, which occupy `4 * (y / 2) = 2y` cells. If `y` is odd, we can place `(y - 1) / 2` 2x2 icons and 1 additional 2x2 icon, which occupies `4 * ((y - 1) / 2) + 4 = 2y` cells.
3. **1x1 Icons**: After placing the 2x2 icons, the remaining cells on the screens used for 2x2 icons can be used for 1x1 icons. If `y` is even, we have `2 * ceil(y / 2) = y` 2x2 icons, which occupy `4y` cells, leaving `15 * ceil(y / 2) - 4y` cells for 1x1 icons. If `y` is odd, we have `2 * ceil(y / 2) = y + 1` 2x2 icons, which occupy `4y` cells, leaving `15 * ceil(y / 2) - 4y` cells for 1x1 icons.
4. **Additional Screens for 1x1 Icons**: If the remaining 1x1 icons do not fit on the screens used for 2x2 icons, we need additional screens. The number of additional screens required is `ceil((x - remaining_cells) / 15)`.

### Code Analysis:
Let's go through the code and see if it correctly implements the above logic.

```python
import math

func_1()

def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        if x > 0 and y > 0:
            bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)  # Screens needed for 2x2 icons
            remaining_cells = 15 * bxsfory - 4 * y  # Remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
            x = x - remaining_cells  # Remaining 1x1 icons after using the remaining cells
            bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)  # Additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
            print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        elif x == 0 and y > 0:
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))  # Only 2x2 icons
        elif x > 0 and y == 0:
            print(math.ceil(x / 15))  # Only 1x1 icons
        else:
            print(0)  # No icons
```

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Cells**: The calculation `remaining_cells = 15 * bxsfory - 4 * y` is incorrect because it assumes all screens used for 2x2 icons are fully utilized, which is not always the case. For example, if `y = 1`, we need 1 screen for the 2x2 icon, which leaves 11 cells, not `15 - 4 = 11`.
2. **Incorrect Adjustment of `x`**: The line `x = x - remaining_cells` is incorrect because `remaining_cells` can be negative if more cells are occupied by 2x2 icons than the total cells available on the screens used for 2x2 icons.
3. **Simplification Needed**: The logic can be simplified by directly calculating the total number of cells required and then determining the number of screens needed.

### Corrected Approach:
1. Calculate the total number of cells required for 2x2 icons: `4 * y`.
2. Calculate the total number of cells required for 1x1 icons: `x`.
3. Calculate the total number of cells required: `4 * y + x`.
4. Calculate the number of screens needed: `ceil((4 * y + x) / 15)`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
import math

def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        total_cells_needed = 4 * y + x
        screens_needed = math.ceil(total_cells_needed / 15)
        print(screens_needed)

func_1()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of screens required. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
