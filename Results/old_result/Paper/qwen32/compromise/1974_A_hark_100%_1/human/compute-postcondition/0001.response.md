To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is `k` and `ap`.

The for loop statement is:
```
for k in range(ap):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Here, `k` is the loop variable, and `ap` determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, `ap` must be at least 1 because `range(ap)` generates numbers from 0 to `ap-1`. If `ap` is 0, the loop will not execute.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **`ap`**: This variable determines the number of iterations of the loop. For the loop to execute, `ap` must be greater than 0.
2. **`k`**: This is the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is automatically assigned the values from `range(ap)` during each iteration.

The other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

So, the state needs to be adjusted such that `ap` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `x` and `y` are integers (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99), `ap` must be greater than 0**
