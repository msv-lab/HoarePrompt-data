Let's analyze the problem and the given program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
- We start with a fully connected graph of n islands, meaning there are \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) bridges.
- Dominater can destroy at most k bridges.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of islands Everule can visit starting from island 1.

### Key Observations:
1. If \(k = 0\), no bridges are destroyed, and Everule can visit all \(n\) islands.
2. If Dominater can destroy enough bridges to disconnect island 1 from all other islands, Everule can only visit island 1. This happens when \(k \ge n-1\).
3. If \(0 < k < n-1\), Dominater cannot completely disconnect island 1 from all other islands, but can disconnect it from some of them. However, as long as \(k < n-1\), there will still be a path from island 1 to some other islands.

### Correctness of the Program:
The provided program uses the logic:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
```
Let's break down the logic:
- `n - k <= 1` is true when \(k \ge n-1\). In this case, Dominater can destroy enough bridges to disconnect island 1 from all other islands, so Everule can only visit island 1.
- If `n - k > 1`, it means \(k < n-1\), and Dominater cannot disconnect island 1 from all other islands. In this case, Everule can visit all \(n\) islands.

However, there is a mistake in the logic:
- The condition `n - k <= 1` should be `k >= n-1` to correctly determine when island 1 can be disconnected from all other islands.
- The correct condition should be `k < n-1` for Everule to be able to visit all \(n\) islands.

### Corrected Logic:
The correct condition should be:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(n if k < n-1 else 1)
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of islands Everule can visit. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
