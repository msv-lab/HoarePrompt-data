To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's analyze the loop and its effect on the variables.

The loop iterates over all integers `i` from 1 to the integer square root of `x` (inclusive). For each `i`, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `x` (i.e., `x % i == 0`). If `i` is a divisor, it then checks two conditions:
1. If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `i`.
2. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i`.

The variable `ans` is initialized to 0 and is updated based on the above conditions.

The purpose of the loop is to find the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or the largest corresponding `x // i` that is less than or equal to `n`.

Let's summarize the output state in a natural language format:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `x` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `ans` will be the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or the largest `x // i` that is less than or equal to `n`.

Given the initial state and the loop, the output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= x; `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or the largest `x // i` that is less than or equal to `n`.**
