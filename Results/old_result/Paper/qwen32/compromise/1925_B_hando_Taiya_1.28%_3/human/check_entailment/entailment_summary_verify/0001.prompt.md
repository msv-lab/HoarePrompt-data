You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads two integers `x` and `n` for each of `t` test cases. For each test case, it calculates and prints the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or the largest `x // i` that is less than or equal to `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to break a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that:
1. Each sub-problem has a positive integer difficulty.
2. The sum of the difficulties of the sub-problems equals `x`.
3. The balance of the problemset, defined as the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of all sub-problems, is maximized.

### Solution Approach:
The solution provided attempts to find the maximum possible GCD by iterating over possible divisors of `x` and checking if they can be used to partition `x` into `n` sub-problems.

### Detailed Reasoning:
1. **Iterating Over Divisors**:
   - The program iterates over all integers `i` from 1 to the integer square root of `x` (`isqrt(x) + 1`).
   - For each `i`, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `x` (`x % i == 0`).

2. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - If `i` is a divisor, it checks two conditions:
     - **Condition 1**: If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it means we can partition `x` into `n` sub-problems where each sub-problem has a difficulty of `i` (since `n * i <= x`).
     - **Condition 2**: If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it means we can partition `x` into `n` sub-problems where one sub-problem has a difficulty of `x // i` and the rest have a difficulty of 1 (since `i >= n`).

3. **Updating the Answer**:
   - If either condition is satisfied, it updates the maximum possible GCD (`ans`) to be the maximum of the current `ans` and `i` (or `x // i` depending on the condition).

4. **Printing the Result**:
   - After iterating through all possible divisors, it prints the maximum GCD found (`ans`).

### Verification Against Test Cases:
Let's verify the solution against the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - **Input**: `10 3`
   - **Output**: `2`
   - **Explanation**: The problem can be divided into sub-problems with difficulties `4, 2, 4` (GCD = 2).

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - **Input**: `5 5`
   - **Output**: `1`
   - **Explanation**: The problem can be divided into sub-problems with difficulties `1, 1, 1, 1, 1` (GCD = 1).

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - **Input**: `420 69`
   - **Output**: `6`
   - **Explanation**: The problem can be divided into sub-problems with difficulties that include `6` (GCD = 6).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance (GCD) of the problemset by iterating over possible divisors and checking feasibility conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
