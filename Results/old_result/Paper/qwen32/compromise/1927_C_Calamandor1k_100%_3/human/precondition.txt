t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case in the list 'cases' is a tuple containing three elements: n, m, and k, where n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, and k is an even integer such that 2 <= k <= 2 * min(n, m). The fourth element of each tuple is a list 'a' of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. The fifth element of each tuple is a list 'b' of m integers where each integer b_j satisfies 1 <= b_j <= 10^6. The sum of all n and m across all test cases does not exceed 4*10^5.
