Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it evaluates whether certain conditions related to the elements in `a` and `b` and the value of `k` are satisfied. It returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' responses, one for each test case, indicating whether the conditions are met.**
