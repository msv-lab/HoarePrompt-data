Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^3. For each test case, it accepts two integers `x` and `n` such that 1 <= n <= x and 1 <= x <= 10^8. The function returns the result for each test case based on the provided values of `x` and `n`.**
