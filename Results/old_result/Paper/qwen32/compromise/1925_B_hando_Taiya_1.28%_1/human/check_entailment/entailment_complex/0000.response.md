Reasoning: 
The program aims to find the maximum balance (GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems) that Yash can achieve by breaking up a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems. The core logic of the program is to find the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or its corresponding pair divisor `x // i` that is also less than or equal to `n`. This divisor represents the maximum possible balance because it ensures that the difficulties of the sub-problems can be distributed in such a way that their GCD is maximized.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the integers `x` and `n`.
3. It then iterates through all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
4. For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` or `x // i` (the corresponding pair divisor) is less than or equal to `n`.
5. It keeps track of the maximum divisor found that satisfies the condition.
6. Finally, it prints the maximum divisor found, which represents the maximum balance.

The provided example cases are correctly handled by the program:
- For `x = 10` and `n = 3`, the largest divisor of `10` that is less than or equal to `3` or its pair divisor that is also less than or equal to `3` is `2`.
- For `x = 5` and `n = 5`, the only divisor of `5` that is less than or equal to `5` is `1`.
- For `x = 420` and `n = 69`, the largest divisor of `420` that is less than or equal to `69` or its pair divisor that is also less than or equal to `69` is `6`.

Given that the logic correctly handles the example cases and is consistent with the problem statement, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
