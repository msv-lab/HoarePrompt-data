Let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state.

Initial State:
- `x` is increased by 1, so `x` is now some value `x_new`.
- `n` must be at least `((x_new + 1) * x_new)`.
- `y` is 1.
- `m` must be at least `(x_new + 1)`.
- The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1 (which is trivially true since `y` is 1).

Code Snippet:
```python
cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

Given that `y` is 1, the expression simplifies to:
```python
cnt += min(n // ((x + 1) * x), m // (x + 1))
```

Let's denote:
- `a = n // ((x + 1) * x)`
- `b = m // (x + 1)`

Then, `cnt` is incremented by `min(a, b)`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not specified, we can only express the new value of `cnt` in terms of `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`x` is increased by 1, `n` must be at least `((x + 1) * x)`, `y` is 1, `m` must be at least `(x + 1)`, the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, and `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // ((x + 1) * x), m // (x + 1))`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is:
- `x` has been incremented by 1.
- `n` still must be at least `((x + 1) * x)`.
- `y` remains 1.
- `m` still must be at least `(x + 1)`.
- The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is still 1.
- `cnt` has been increased by the minimum of `n // ((x + 1) * x)` and `m // (x + 1)`.
