To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop:

```
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
    # the loop body is omit
```

From this, we can see that the loop will continue as long as both `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 6
- `x` is 1
- `y` is 3
- `cnt` is calculated based on the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`

Let's evaluate the conditions:
1. `(x + y) * x <= n`
   - Substituting the values: `(1 + 3) * 1 = 4`
   - This means `4 <= n`
   - Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, it already satisfies `4 <= n`.

2. `(x + y) * y <= m`
   - Substituting the values: `(1 + 3) * 3 = 12`
   - This means `12 <= m`
   - Since `m` must be greater than or equal to 6, it does not necessarily satisfy `12 <= m`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `m` so that `12 <= m`.

Therefore, the state needs to be modified such that `m` is at least 12.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `m` must be greater than or equal to 12, `x` is 1, `y` is 3, and `cnt` is `min(n // 2, m // 2) + min(n // 3, m // 6)` if the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains `min(n // 2, m // 2)`**
