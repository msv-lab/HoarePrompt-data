Output State: **`x` is `a + 1`, `y` is 4, `n` must be at least \((x + 3) * x\), `m` must be at least \((x + 3) * 3\). If `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, then `cnt` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing it from 3 to 4. All other variables (`x`, `n`, `m`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
