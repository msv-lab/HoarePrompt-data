The code snippet `y = 1` sets the variable `y` to 1. This affects the value of `y` directly, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is increased by 1, `y` is 1, `n` must be at least `(x + 1) * (x + 1)`, `m` remains unchanged, and `cnt` is incremented based on the GCD condition for each valid pair `(x, y)`**

In natural language: The value of `y` is now 1. The value of `x` has already been increased by 1, `n` must still be at least the square of the new value of `x` plus one, `m` remains the same, and `cnt` continues to be incremented based on the GCD condition for each valid pair `(x, y)`.
