In this case, the loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable, meaning it is not used within the loop body. The loop runs based on the value of `t`. Since the loop has just finished an iteration, the value of `t` would have been decremented (or the loop condition would have been checked against `t`). 

Given that the loop ran once with `t` being 1, `t` would now be 0, and the loop would not execute again because the range function would not generate any further iterations.

However, if we are to adjust the state such that the loop can execute one more time, we need to increment `t` back to 1.

State: **`t` is 1**
