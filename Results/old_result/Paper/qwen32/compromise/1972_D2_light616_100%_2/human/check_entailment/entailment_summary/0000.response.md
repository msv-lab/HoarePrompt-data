### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its functionality against the problem statement.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

#### Code Analysis:

**Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
- This function is designed to process a single test case.
- It reads two integers `n` and `m`.
- It initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
- It iterates over possible values of `x` starting from 1 up to the square root of `n`.
- For each `x`, it iterates over possible values of `y` starting from 1, ensuring that \((x + y) * x \leq n\) and \((x + y) * y \leq m\).
- If `x` and `y` are coprime (\(\gcd(x, y) = 1\)), it increments the counter `cnt` by the minimum of the integer divisions `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.
- Finally, it prints the count of valid pairs.

However, there are some issues with this approach:
- The condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` is not directly checked.
- The loop structure and the way pairs are counted do not align with the problem requirements.

**Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
- This function handles multiple test cases.
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it calls `func_1`.

#### Issues Identified:
- The logic in `func_1` does not correctly implement the problem's requirement to check whether \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
- The nested loops and the counting mechanism are not appropriate for solving the problem as described.

#### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
