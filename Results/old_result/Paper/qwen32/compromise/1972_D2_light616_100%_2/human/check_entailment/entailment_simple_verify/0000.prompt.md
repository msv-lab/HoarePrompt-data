You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
  - \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
  - \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
  - \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function calculates the number of valid pairs for a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.

#### Function `func_1()`:
- It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
- It reads the values of `n` and `m` from the input.
- It iterates through possible values of `x` and `y` to find valid pairs.
- For each pair `(x, y)`, it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) and if \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
- If the conditions are met, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.
- Finally, it prints the count of valid pairs.

#### Function `func_2()`:
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- It calls `func_1()` for each test case.

### Issues in the Provided Program:
The provided program seems to have a logical flaw. Specifically, it only considers pairs where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). However, the problem statement does not restrict the pairs to only those with a greatest common divisor of 1. Therefore, the program will miss valid pairs where \(\gcd(a, b) > 1\).

### Counterexample:
Consider the test case:
```
1
2 2
```
The valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\). Let's check each pair:
- For \((1, 1)\): \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\) which is a multiple of \(1 + 1 = 2\) (False).
- For \((1, 2)\): \(2 \cdot \gcd(1, 2) = 2\) which is a multiple of \(1 + 2 = 3\) (False).
- For \((2, 1)\): \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\) which is a multiple of \(2 + 1 = 3\) (False).
- For \((2, 2)\): \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 4\) which is a multiple of \(2 + 2 = 4\) (True).

The only valid pair is \((2, 2)\), so the output should be 1. However, the provided program will not consider \((2, 2)\) because \(\gcd(2, 2) = 2 \neq 1\).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not handle all cases correctly, specifically it misses pairs where \(\gcd(a, b) > 1\).

Correctness: **False**.
