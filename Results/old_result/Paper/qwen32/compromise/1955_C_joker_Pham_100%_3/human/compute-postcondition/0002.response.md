To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the state of the variables `l` and `r` in the loop condition `while l <= r:`.

Given:
- `l` is initialized to 0.
- `r` is initialized to `n - 1`.

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `l <= r` must be true. Since `l` is initialized to 0 and `r` is initialized to `n - 1`, the condition `l <= r` is true as long as `n` is at least 1, which is already ensured by the problem constraints (`1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`).

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to `l` and `r` for the loop to execute the first time. The state right before the loop is already valid for the loop to start.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`. `sunks` is 0.**
