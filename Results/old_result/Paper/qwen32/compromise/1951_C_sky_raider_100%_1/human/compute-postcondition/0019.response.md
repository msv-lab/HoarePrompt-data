The code snippet provided modifies the variable `c` by adding the product of `s` and the sum of `l[i]` and `t` to its current value. The values of `n`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged according to the given conditions.

Given:
- `n` must be greater than `i`.
- `i` is `i + 1` (this seems to be a description of the state before the code snippet, not part of the code itself).
- `s` is `min(m, k)`.

The code modifies `c` as follows:
- `c += s * (l[i] + t)`

Since `i` is described as `i + 1` before the code snippet, it implies that the value of `i` used in `l[i]` is already incremented from its previous value. Therefore, the output state reflects this increment in `i` and the updated value of `c`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i`; `i` is `i + 1`; `s` is `min(m, k)`; `c` is `c + s * (l[i] + t)`**.

In natural language: The value of `c` is updated by adding the product of `s` and the sum of `l[i]` and `t` to it. The values of `n`, `i`, and `s` remain as per their initial conditions, with `i` being incremented by 1 as described.
