Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). Additionally, a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l.sort()
    t = 0
    s = 0
    c = 0
    for i in range(n):
        s = min(m, k)
        c += s * (l[i] + t)
        t += s
        k -= s
    print(int(c))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the sum of `min(m, k)` over all iterations; `c` is the cumulative sum of `min(m, k) * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration; `k` is the initial `k` minus the total `min(m, k)` accumulated over all iterations; `i` is `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the accumulated sum of `s` over all iterations; `c` is the accumulated cost `sum(s_i * (l[i] + t_i))` for all iterations; `k` is the remaining `k` after all iterations; `i` is the number of iterations completed; `n`, `m`, and `k` are the integers read from the input; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `s` is `min(m, k)` in the last iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the sum of all `s` values, `c` is the cumulative sum of `s * (l[j+4] + t)` for each iteration `j`, `k` is the initial `k` minus the sum of all `s` values, `i` is `4 + n`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are the integers read from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` in each iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
