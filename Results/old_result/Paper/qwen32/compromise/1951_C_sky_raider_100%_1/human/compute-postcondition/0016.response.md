The code snippet `k -= s` means that the value of `k` is decreased by the value of `s`. Given that `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, and `k` is initially an integer read from the input, the new value of `k` will be `k - s`.

Other variables remain unchanged. Here's the updated state:

Output State: **`t` is `2 * s`; `n` must be greater than 0; `m`, `k` are integers read from the input, now `k` is `k - s`; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`; `c` is `c + s * l[i] + s^2`; `i` is `i + 1`**.

In simpler terms, `k` has been reduced by `s`, while all other variables retain their previous values or expressions.
