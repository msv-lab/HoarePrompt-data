To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(c))` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand how the variables `t`, `c`, `k`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `l` are defined and used.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Input Variables:**
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input.
   - `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.

2. **Derived Variables:**
   - `t` is the sum of all `s` values.
   - `c` is the cumulative sum of `s * (l[j+4] + t)` for each iteration `j`.
   - `k` is the initial `k` minus the sum of all `s` values.
   - `i` is `4 + n`.

3. **Iteration Variable:**
   - `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` in each iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Sum Calculation (`t`):**
   - `t` is the sum of all `s` values over the iterations. Since `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` in each iteration, `t` accumulates these minimum values.

2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation (`c`):**
   - `c` is calculated as the cumulative sum of `s * (l[j+4] + t)` for each iteration `j`.
   - For each iteration `j`, `s` is determined as `min(m, k)`.
   - `l[j+4]` accesses an element in the sorted list `l` starting from the 5th element (index 4).
   - `t` is the accumulated sum of `s` values up to the current iteration.

3. **Final Value of `k`:**
   - `k` is initially read from the input and then reduced by the sum of all `s` values (`t`).

4. **Index `i`:**
   - `i` is simply `4 + n`, but it does not directly influence the calculation of `c`.

### Output Explanation:

Given the above analysis, the `print(int(c))` statement will output the final value of `c` after all iterations are completed. Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `l` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `c`. However, we can describe it precisely based on the given information.

### Final Output:

Output: **c (where c is the cumulative sum of s * (l[j+4] + t) for each iteration j, with s being the minimum of m and k in each iteration)**
