Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly generate the required array for each test case. The function `func_1` is supposed to generate a sequence such that the number of increasing subsequences is equal to the given number `X`. However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not achieve this goal.

The function attempts to recursively build the sequence by determining the appropriate size and overlap of subsequences, but it does not correctly calculate the number of increasing subsequences that the generated sequence will have. As a result, the output sequences do not correspond to the required number of increasing subsequences `X`.

To solve this problem correctly, a different approach is needed. One such approach is to use a binary representation of `X` to determine the structure of the array. Specifically, the number of increasing subsequences in an array of the form `[1, 2, ..., k, 1, 2, ..., k, ..., 1, 2, ..., k]` (repeated `m` times) can be related to the binary representation of `X`. However, the provided program does not implement such a strategy.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
