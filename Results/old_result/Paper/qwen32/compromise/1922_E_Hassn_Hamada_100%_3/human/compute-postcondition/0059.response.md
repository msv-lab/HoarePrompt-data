The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `size - overlap`. If `i` is less than `size - overlap`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, and `size` is greater than `overlap`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `size - overlap` after it has been incremented.

Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be the previous value of `i` plus 1. We need to ensure that this new value of `i` is still less than `size - overlap` for the loop to continue.

So, if `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be `i + 2` (since `i` was already incremented by 1).

State: **`size` is greater than `overlap`; `sequence` has an additional element equal to `(i + 1) + overlap`; `i` is `i + 2`**
