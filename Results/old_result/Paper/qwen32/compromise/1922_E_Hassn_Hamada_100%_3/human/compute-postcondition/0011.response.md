The value of `size` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `size` was 2, so the new value of `size` is 3. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`number` must be at least 7, `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one element, `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `size` is 3, `i` is 0, `value` is 3**.
