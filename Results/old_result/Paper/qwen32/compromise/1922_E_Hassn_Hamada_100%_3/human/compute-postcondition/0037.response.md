The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates from `max(sequence, default=0)` down to `0` with a step of `-1`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` according to the loop's decrement step.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `0`.
- The loop decrements `i` by `1` in each iteration.

Since `i` is `0` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop would terminate if it were to decrement `i` again because the loop condition is `i` down to `-1` (inclusive), but it would not start with `i` as `-1` in the next iteration because the loop would have already stopped.

Therefore, to execute one more time, `i` should be set to the starting value of the loop, which is `max(sequence, default=0)`. However, since we do not have the value of `sequence`, we can only infer that `i` should be set to a value that is one more than `0` (the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration) to simulate the start of a new iteration.

State: **`size` is 60, `value` is 1152921504606846976, and `i` is 1**
