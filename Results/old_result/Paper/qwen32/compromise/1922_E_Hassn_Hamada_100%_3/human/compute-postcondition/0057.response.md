The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `size - overlap`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was such that `i + 1` would be the next value it should take. Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value such that `i + 1` is the next value it should take.
- Since `sequence` has an additional element equal to `i + overlap`, this element was added during the previous iteration.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`.

State: **`size` is greater than `overlap`; `sequence` has an additional element equal to `i + overlap`; `i` is `i + 1`**
