The given code snippet updates the value of the variable `value` based on the bitwise shift operations. Let's calculate the new value of `value`.

Given:
- `size` is 4
- `value` is 6 (initially, but this will change)
- `i` is 1
- `number` must be at least 14 (this condition is not affected by the code snippet)

The expression `(1 << size) - (1 << i)` can be evaluated as follows:
- `1 << size` is `1 << 4`, which is `16` (since 1 shifted left by 4 positions is 10000 in binary, which is 16 in decimal).
- `1 << i` is `1 << 1`, which is `2` (since 1 shifted left by 1 position is 10 in binary, which is 2 in decimal).
- Therefore, `(1 << size) - (1 << i)` is `16 - 2`, which equals `14`.

Thus, `value` is updated to `14`.

Output State: **`size` is 4, `value` is 14, `i` is 1, and `number` must be at least 14.**
