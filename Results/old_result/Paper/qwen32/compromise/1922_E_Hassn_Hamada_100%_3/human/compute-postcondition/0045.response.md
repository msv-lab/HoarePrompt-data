To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition:

```
while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:
```

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `size` is 4
- `value` is 14
- `i` is 1
- `number` must be at least 14

First, let's compute the loop condition with the current values of `size` and `i`:

\[
(1 << \text{size} + 1) - (1 << \text{i}) = (1 << 4 + 1) - (1 << 1) = (1 << 5) - (1 << 1) = 32 - 2 = 30
\]

The loop condition is:

\[
30 \leq \text{number}
\]

Since `number` must be at least 14, we need to ensure that `number` is at least 30 for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, the state of `number` needs to be adjusted to be at least 30. No other states (`size` and `i`) need to be adjusted because the loop condition only depends on these three variables.

State: **`size` is 4, `value` is 14, `i` is 1, and `number` must be at least 30**
