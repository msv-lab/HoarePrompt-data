The code snippet assigns values to `size` and `value` based on the expression involving `i`. However, `i` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine specific numerical values for `size` and `value`. We can express `size` and `value` in terms of `i`.

- `size` is assigned the value `i + 1`.
- `value` is assigned the value `(1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)`, which simplifies to `2**(i + 1) - 2**i`, and further simplifies to `2**i`.

Therefore, the Output State will include the new values of `size` and `value` in terms of `i`, while `number`, `sequence`, and `size_overlap` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one element, `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `size` is `i + 1`, `value` is `2**i`**.
