The code appends a new element to the `sequence` list, which is the value of `i + overlap`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 before this operation, we need to account for that in the new element being added. The value of `i` is now `i + 1` from the initial state, so the new element added to `sequence` will be `(i + 1) + overlap`.

Output State: **`size` is greater than `overlap`; `sequence` has an additional element equal to `(i + 1) + overlap`; `i` is `i + 1`**.
