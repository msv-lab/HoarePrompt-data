The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `c` with a length between 1 and 18, where each integer is between 0 and 10^7. It prints specific lines based on whether the list `c` is exactly `[2]` or not. If `c` is `[2]`, it prints "4 1" followed by "1 2". Otherwise, it prints "13 0". The function does not return any value.
