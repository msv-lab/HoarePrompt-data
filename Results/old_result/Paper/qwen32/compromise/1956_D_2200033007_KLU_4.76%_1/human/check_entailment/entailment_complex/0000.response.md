Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The function `func_1` only checks if the length of the array `c` is exactly 2 and prints a fixed output based on this condition. However, the problem requires finding the maximum sum of the array by performing a series of operations that change the values of subarrays to their MEX (minimum excluded value). The program does not perform any operations on the array and does not calculate the MEX for any subarray. Therefore, it fails to provide the correct output for all possible inputs as described in the problem statement.

Examples:
- For the input `2\n0 1`, the program should output `4 1\n1 2` because the MEX of `{0, 1}` is `2`, and setting both elements to `2` results in the maximum sum of `4`.
- For the input `3\n1 3 9`, the program should output `13 0` because the initial sum `1 + 3 + 9 = 13` is already the maximum possible sum.
- For the input `4\n1 100 2 1`, the program should output `105 2\n3 3\n3 4` because setting `a[3]` to `0` (MEX of `{2}`) and then setting `a[3]` and `a[4]` to `2` (MEX of `{0, 1}`) results in the array `[1, 100, 2, 2]` with a sum of `105`.

Since the program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
