### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing the MEX operation. Here is a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Handling of Input:**
   - The program reads the input but does not convert the elements of the array `a` to integers. This will cause issues when performing operations that involve arithmetic or comparisons.
   - The program incorrectly handles the input by only checking the length of the array `c` in `func_1`, without processing the actual values in the array.

2. **Logic Implementation:**
   - The program only handles two specific cases:
     - When the length of the array is 2, it outputs `4 1` followed by `1 2`.
     - For all other lengths, it outputs `13 0`.
   - This hardcoded behavior does not consider the actual values in the array or perform any operations to maximize the sum using the MEX operation.

3. **Expected vs Actual Output:**
   - **First Example:**
     - Input: `2\n0 1`
     - Expected Output: `4 1\n1 2`
     - Actual Output: `4 1` (without performing any operations)
     - The program correctly handles this specific case but does not perform the operation.
   - **Second Example:**
     - Input: `3\n1 3 9`
     - Expected Output: `13 0`
     - Actual Output: `13 0`
     - The program correctly handles this specific case but does not perform any operations.
   - **Third Example:**
     - Input: `4\n1 100 2 1`
     - Expected Output: `105 2\n3 3\n3 4`
     - Actual Output: `13 0`
     - The program incorrectly outputs `13 0` without performing any operations.
   - **Fourth Example:**
     - Input: `1\n0`
     - Expected Output: `1 1\n1 1`
     - Actual Output: `13 0`
     - The program incorrectly outputs `13 0` without performing any operations.

4. **Function Summary:**
   - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the program, which is to output fixed results based on the length of the array without considering the actual values or performing any operations.

### Conclusion:
The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description as it fails to compute the correct maximum sum and the sequence of operations for all potential cases. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

**Final: False**
