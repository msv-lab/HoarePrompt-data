Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. The program only handles two specific cases (when the length of the array is 2 and for all other lengths) and does not implement the logic to compute the MEX and maximize the sum of the array elements as described in the problem statement. The program should dynamically compute the MEX for different subarrays and apply the operations to maximize the sum, which is not done in the current implementation.
