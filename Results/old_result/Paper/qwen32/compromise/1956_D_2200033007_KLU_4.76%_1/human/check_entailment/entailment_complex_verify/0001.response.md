### Reasoning:

The original assessment accurately identifies several critical flaws in the provided program. Let's break down why the program is incorrect and why the original assessment is valid.

1. **Input Conversion**: The program reads the input array as strings and does not convert them to integers. This is crucial because the operations described in the problem statement involve numerical comparisons and calculations. Without converting the strings to integers, the program cannot correctly compute the MEX or perform the required operations.

2. **Fixed Output for Specific Cases**: The function `func_1` only provides hardcoded outputs based on the length of the array. Specifically:
   - If the length of the array is 2, it outputs `4 1` and `1 2`. This is only correct for the specific case of the array `[0, 1]`. For any other array of length 2, this output is incorrect.
   - For any other array length, it outputs `13 0`. This is only correct for the specific example `[1, 3, 9]`. For all other cases, this output is incorrect.

3. **Lack of MEX Calculation and Operations**: The program does not implement the logic to compute the MEX of any subarray or to perform the operations as described in the problem statement. It does not attempt to maximize the sum of the array based on the given rules. The MEX operation is a key part of the problem, and the program does not even attempt to calculate it.

4. **General Solution**: The program does not provide a general solution that works for all possible input cases. It only handles a few specific cases with hardcoded outputs.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible input cases. It fails to convert input strings to integers, provides hardcoded outputs for specific cases, and does not implement the required logic to compute the MEX and perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
