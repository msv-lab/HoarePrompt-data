Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when `n` is 1. According to the problem statement, if `n == 1`, there should be a string of length 2 with exactly one special character. The program incorrectly prints "NO" for `n == 1` instead of providing a valid string.

For example, for `n == 1`, a valid output could be:
```
YES
AB
```
Here, 'A' is a special character because it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors ('B'). Similarly, 'B' is also a special character, but the problem only requires one special character.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where `n` is odd correctly. The program should be able to generate a string with exactly `n` special characters for any `n` within the given constraints.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import string

def func():
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('YES')
            print('AB')
        else:
            ans = 'AAA'
            x = 1
            for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                ans += s[x] * 2
                x += 1
            if n % 2 == 0:
                ans += s[x]
            print('YES')
            print(ans)

func()
```

This version correctly handles the case when `n == 1` and ensures that the generated string has exactly `n` special characters.
