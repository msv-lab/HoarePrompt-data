### Reasoning:

The given program aims to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Logic for Constructing the String:**
   - If `n == 1`, the program correctly outputs "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly one special character in a string of uppercase letters.
   - For `n > 1`:
     - If `n` is even, the program constructs a string by repeating pairs of consecutive letters from 'A' onwards. For example, for `n = 6`, the string "AAABAACC" is constructed, which indeed has 6 special characters.
     - If `n` is odd, the program starts with "AAA" and then repeats pairs of consecutive letters from 'B' onwards. For example, for `n = 3`, the string "AAA" is constructed, which has 3 special characters.

3. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints "YES" followed by the constructed string when a valid string can be formed.
   - It correctly prints "NO" when no valid string can be formed (only when `n == 1`).

### Checking the Example:
- For `n = 6`, the output is "YES" followed by "AAABAACC", which is correct.
- For `n = 1`, the output is "NO", which is correct.
- For `n = 2`, the output is "YES" followed by "MM", which is correct (though "AA" or "BB" would also be valid).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the provided test cases and adheres to the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
