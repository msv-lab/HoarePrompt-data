Output State: **`t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50); `n` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to 1, and `n` is greater than 4; `ans` is a string containing `s[x] * 6`; `x` is 2; `s` is undefined; `j` is 2**

The value of `ans` has been updated to include `s[x] * 2` more times, making it `s[x] * 6`. The other variables remain unchanged.
