The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n // 2`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. Also, `n // 2` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50); `n` is at least 4; `x` is 2; `ans` is the first character of `s` repeated twice followed by the second character of `s` repeated twice; `j` is 2**
