The given Python code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` attempts to concatenate to the string `ans` the character at index `x` of the string `s`, repeated twice. However, the initial state provided does not include a definition or value for the variable `s`. Since `s` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the specific characters that will be added to `ans`. 

Given the information provided, we can only state that `ans` will now contain the character at index `x` of `s`, repeated twice, and `x` remains unchanged. The variables `t` and `n` are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50); `n` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to 1, and `n` is even; `ans` is a string containing `s[x] * 2`; `x` is 0; `s` is undefined.**
