The value of `x` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `x` was 3, so after the operation, `x` becomes 4. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `ans`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50); `n` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to 1, and `n` is odd, `n` must be at least 5; `ans` is `'AAA' + s[1] * 2 + s[2] * 2 + s[3] * 2`; `x` is 4; `j` is 2**
