The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the expression `n // 2`. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` for the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the current iteration index, and `n` is at least 2. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n // 2`. 

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- `n` remains unchanged as it determines the loop's boundary.

Given that `ans` and `t` do not influence the loop's execution directly, they remain the same.

Let's assume `j` was `0` at the end of the previous iteration. Then, for the next iteration, `j` should be `1`.

State: **`t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50); `n` is at least 2; `x` is 1; `ans` is the first character of `s` repeated twice; `j` is 1**
