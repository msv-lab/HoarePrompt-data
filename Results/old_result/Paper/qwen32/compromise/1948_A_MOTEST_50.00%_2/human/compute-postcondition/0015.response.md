The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends `s[x] * 2` to the existing value of `ans`. Given that `ans` initially contains `s[x] * 2` and `x` is 1, the new value of `ans` will be `s[x] * 2` concatenated with `s[x] * 2`, which results in `s[x] * 4`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, and `j`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50); `n` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to 1, and `n` is even; `ans` is a string containing `s[x] * 4`; `x` is 1; `s` is undefined; `j` is 1**.
