The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends to the string `ans` the character at index `x` of the string `s`, repeated twice. Given that `x` is 3, the character at index 3 of `s` is duplicated and appended to `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50), `n` is an odd integer greater than or equal to 3, `x` is 3, `ans` is `'AAA' + s[1] * 2 + s[2] * 2 + s[3] * 2`, `j` is 2, `i` is `i + 1` if `n` is not equal to 1**.

In natural language: The value of `ans` is updated to include the character at index 3 of `s`, repeated twice, appended to its previous value. All other variables retain their initial values.
