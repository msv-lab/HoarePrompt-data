The value of `x` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `x` is 2, so after the operation, `x` becomes 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50), `n` is an odd integer greater than or equal to 3, `x` is 3, `ans` is `'AAA' + s[1] * 2 + s[2] * 2`, `j` is 1, `i` is `i + 1` if `n` is not equal to 1**.
