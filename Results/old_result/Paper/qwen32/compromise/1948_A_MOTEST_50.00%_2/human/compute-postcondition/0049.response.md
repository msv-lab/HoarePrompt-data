The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` of the string `s`, repeated twice, to the string `ans`. Given that `x` is 2, this means the character at index 2 of `s` will be repeated twice and appended to `ans`.

Initial State: `t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50); `n` is at least 4; `x` is 2; `ans` is the first character of `s` repeated twice followed by the second character of `s` repeated twice; `j` is 2

After executing the code snippet, `ans` will be updated to include the character at index 2 of `s`, repeated twice, appended to its current value.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50); `n` is at least 4; `x` is 2; `ans` is the first character of `s` repeated twice followed by the second character of `s` repeated twice and then the character at index 2 of `s` repeated twice; `j` is 2**
