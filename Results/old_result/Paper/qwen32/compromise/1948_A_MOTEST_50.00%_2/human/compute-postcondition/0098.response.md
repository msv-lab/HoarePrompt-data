Postcondition: **`t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50); `n` is the input integer; `i` is incremented by 1. If `n` is not equal to 1, `ans` is a string formed by repeating each of the first `n // 2` characters of `s` twice if `n` is even, or `'AAA'` followed by repeating each of the characters from `s[1]` to `s[(n // 2) - 1]` twice if `n` is odd; `x` is `n // 2`.**
