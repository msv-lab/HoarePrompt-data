The code snippet provided resets the set `st` to an empty set. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list of integers returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, and `st` is an empty set.**
