#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_1`.
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains integers converted from the input string, where the input string is split by whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes no input parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits it by whitespace, converts each split component to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function signature is not provided in the given code snippet. However, based on the context of the problem, a function signature might look something like `def func_1(p, x):` where `p` is a permutation list of integers from 1 to n, and `x` is an integer that needs to be found in the permutation using a modified binary search with up to 2 swaps.
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())
    #The program returns a list containing the result of the function `func_1(p, x)`, which is expected to perform a modified binary search on the permutation list `p` to find the integer `x` with up to 2 swaps.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a permutation list `p` of integers from 1 to n and an integer `x`. It performs a modified binary search on the permutation list `p` to find the integer `x` with up to 2 swaps. The function returns a list containing the result of this search.
