You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
from math import ceil
from typing import Optional
#Function 1:
def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if extroverts % 3 != 0:
        if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3:
            return None
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

#Function 2:
def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts three non-negative integer parameters representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. It returns -1 if a call to `func_1` with the extroverts and universals as arguments results in `None`; otherwise, it returns the sum of the introverts and the result of `func_1`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Introverts (a)**: Each introvert must be in a tent by themselves.
2. **Extroverts (b)**: Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others.
3. **Universals (c)**: Universals can be in a tent with 0, 1, or 2 others.

### Conditions for Tents:
- Each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.
- The number of tents needed must satisfy the conditions for introverts and extroverts.
- Universals can fill in the gaps to meet the requirements.

### Steps to Solve:
- **Step 1**: Calculate the number of tents required for introverts. This is simply the number of introverts `a` since each introvert needs a tent by themselves.
- **Step 2**: Calculate the number of tents required for extroverts. Since each extrovert needs a tent with exactly two others, the number of extroverts must be divisible by 3. If not, we need to check if we can use universals to fill the gaps.
- **Step 3**: If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, we need to ensure that the remaining extroverts and universals can form complete tents of 3. If not, it's impossible to accommodate everyone, and we should return -1.
- **Step 4**: Sum the number of tents for introverts and the calculated number of tents for extroverts and universals.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program consists of two functions:
1. **func_1(extroverts, universals)**: This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals. It returns `None` if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and there aren't enough universals to fill the gaps.
2. **func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals)**: This function uses `func_1` to get the number of tents for extroverts and universals. If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of tents for introverts and the result from `func_1`.

### Correctness Check:
Let's go through the provided examples to see if the program works correctly:
1. **Example 1**: `1 2 3`
   - Introverts: 1 tent
   - Extroverts: 2 extroverts + 1 universal = 1 tent
   - Total: 2 tents
   - `func_1(2, 3)` returns 1, `func_2(1, 2, 3)` returns 2 (Incorrect, should be 3)

2. **Example 2**: `1 4 1`
   - Introverts: 1 tent
   - Extroverts: 4 extroverts + 1 universal = Not possible to form complete tents
   - `func_1(4, 1)` returns None, `func_2(1, 4, 1)` returns -1 (Correct)

3. **Example 3**: `1 4 2`
   - Introverts: 1 tent
   - Extroverts: 4 extroverts + 2 universals = 2 tents
   - Total: 3 tents
   - `func_1(4, 2)` returns 2, `func_2(1, 4, 2)` returns 3 (Correct)

4. **Example 4**: `1 1 1`
   - Introverts: 1 tent
   - Extroverts: 1 extrovert + 1 universal = Not possible to form complete tents
   - `func_1(1, 1)` returns None, `func_2(1, 1, 1)` returns -1 (Correct)

5. **Example 5**: `1 3 2`
   - Introverts: 1 tent
   - Extroverts: 3 extroverts = 1 tent
   - Total: 2 tents
   - `func_1(3, 2)` returns 1, `func_2(1, 3, 2)` returns 2 (Incorrect, should be 3)

6. **Example 6**: `19 7 18`
   - Introverts: 19 tents
   - Extroverts: 7 extroverts + 18 universals = 8 tents
   - Total: 27 tents
   - `func_1(7, 18)` returns 8, `func_2(19, 7, 18)` returns 27 (Incorrect, should be 28)

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly calculate the number of tents in all cases. Specifically, it does not account for the need to form additional tents when the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, even if there are enough universals to fill the gaps.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
