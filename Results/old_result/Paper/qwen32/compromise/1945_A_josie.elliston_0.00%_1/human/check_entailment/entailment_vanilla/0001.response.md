Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Introverts (a)**: Each introvert must be in a tent by themselves.
2. **Extroverts (b)**: Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others.
3. **Universals (c)**: Universals can be in a tent with 0, 1, or 2 others.

### Conditions for Tents:
- Each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.
- The number of tents needed must satisfy the conditions for introverts and extroverts.
- Universals can fill in the gaps to meet the requirements.

### Steps to Solve:
- **Step 1**: Calculate the number of tents required for introverts. This is simply the number of introverts `a` since each introvert needs a tent by themselves.
- **Step 2**: Calculate the number of tents required for extroverts. Since each extrovert needs a tent with exactly two others, the number of extroverts must be divisible by 3. If not, we need to check if we can use universals to fill the gaps.
- **Step 3**: If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, we need to ensure that the remaining extroverts and universals can form complete tents of 3. If not, it's impossible to accommodate everyone, and we should return -1.
- **Step 4**: Sum the number of tents for introverts and the calculated number of tents for extroverts and universals.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program consists of two functions:
1. **func_1(extroverts, universals)**: This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals. It returns `None` if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and there aren't enough universals to fill the gaps.
2. **func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals)**: This function uses `func_1` to get the number of tents for extroverts and universals. If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of tents for introverts and the result from `func_1`.

### Correctness Check:
Let's go through the provided examples to see if the program works correctly:
1. **Example 1**: `1 2 3`
   - Introverts: 1 tent
   - Extroverts: 2 extroverts + 1 universal = 1 tent
   - Total: 2 tents
   - `func_1(2, 3)` returns 1, `func_2(1, 2, 3)` returns 2 (Incorrect, should be 3)

2. **Example 2**: `1 4 1`
   - Introverts: 1 tent
   - Extroverts: 4 extroverts + 1 universal = Not possible to form complete tents
   - `func_1(4, 1)` returns None, `func_2(1, 4, 1)` returns -1 (Correct)

3. **Example 3**: `1 4 2`
   - Introverts: 1 tent
   - Extroverts: 4 extroverts + 2 universals = 2 tents
   - Total: 3 tents
   - `func_1(4, 2)` returns 2, `func_2(1, 4, 2)` returns 3 (Correct)

4. **Example 4**: `1 1 1`
   - Introverts: 1 tent
   - Extroverts: 1 extrovert + 1 universal = Not possible to form complete tents
   - `func_1(1, 1)` returns None, `func_2(1, 1, 1)` returns -1 (Correct)

5. **Example 5**: `1 3 2`
   - Introverts: 1 tent
   - Extroverts: 3 extroverts = 1 tent
   - Total: 2 tents
   - `func_1(3, 2)` returns 1, `func_2(1, 3, 2)` returns 2 (Incorrect, should be 3)

6. **Example 6**: `19 7 18`
   - Introverts: 19 tents
   - Extroverts: 7 extroverts + 18 universals = 8 tents
   - Total: 27 tents
   - `func_1(7, 18)` returns 8, `func_2(19, 7, 18)` returns 27 (Incorrect, should be 28)

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly calculate the number of tents in all cases. Specifically, it does not account for the need to form additional tents when the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, even if there are enough universals to fill the gaps.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
