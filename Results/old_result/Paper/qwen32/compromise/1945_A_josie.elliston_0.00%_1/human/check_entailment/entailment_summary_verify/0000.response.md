### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the code and the provided function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts (`extroverts % 3 != 0`), it checks if the sum of the remainder of extroverts and universals is less than 3. If so, it returns `None`, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of tents needed by taking the ceiling of the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the total number of tents needed for all participants.
   - It calls `func_1` with the number of extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and the result from `func_1`.

### Analysis of the Test Case `0 2 1`:

- **Input**: `0 2 1`
- **Expected Output**: `-1`
- **Execution**:
  - `func_1(extroverts=2, universals=1)`:
    - `extroverts % 3` is `2`, which is not `0`.
    - `extroverts % 3 + universals` is `2 + 1 = 3`, which is not less than `3`.
    - Therefore, `func_1` returns `ceil((2 + 1) / 3) = ceil(1) = 1`.
  - `func_2(introverts=0, extroverts=2, universals=1)`:
    - Since `func_1` returned `1`, `func_2` returns `0 + 1 = 1`.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is correct. The code does not handle the case where the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3 and there are not enough universals to make up the difference. In the test case `0 2 1`, the code incorrectly returns `1` instead of `-1`.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
