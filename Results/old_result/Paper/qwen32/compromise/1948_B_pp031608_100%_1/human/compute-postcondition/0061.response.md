The code snippet updates the `arr` variable by reading a line of input, splitting it into individual components, converting each component to an integer, and storing these integers in a list.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99; `m` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `ans` is either True or False depending on whether any `nums` list was unsorted.**
