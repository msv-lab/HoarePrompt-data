Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `ans` is False, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and `nums` is not sorted.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that the variable `ans` has been set to `False`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
