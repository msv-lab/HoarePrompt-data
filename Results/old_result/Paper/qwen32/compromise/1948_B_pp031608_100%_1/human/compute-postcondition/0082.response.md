Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input with `arr[i - 1]` set to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `i` is `m - 3`, `ans` is `False` and the loop breaks.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `arr`, `nums`, `i`, or `ans`. It only terminates the loop that it is inside, but since no changes are made to the variables, their values remain the same as described in the initial state.
