To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, we need to analyze the variables and their relationships based on the initial state provided.

Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. This variable represents the number of test cases, but it does not directly influence the current print statement.
- `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50. This specifies the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99. This list is not directly used in the print statement.
- `m` is an input integer. This variable is not directly used in the print statement.
- `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input, potentially modified if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and `nums` is sorted. This list is also not directly used in the print statement.
- `nums` is a list that is sorted during the loop iterations.
- `ans` is a boolean variable that is True if all `nums` formed during the loop iterations were sorted, otherwise `ans` is False.

The print statement is:
```python
print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

This line uses a list indexing technique to print either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the value of `ans`. Specifically:
- If `ans` is `False`, `['NO', 'YES'][ans]` evaluates to `['NO', 'YES'][0]`, which is `'NO'`.
- If `ans` is `True`, `['NO', 'YES'][ans]` evaluates to `['NO', 'YES'][1]`, which is `'YES'`.

Thus, the output depends on the value of `ans`. Since the exact value of `ans` is not provided in the initial state, we can only describe the output based on the possible values of `ans`.

Output: **'YES' if ans is True, otherwise 'NO'**
