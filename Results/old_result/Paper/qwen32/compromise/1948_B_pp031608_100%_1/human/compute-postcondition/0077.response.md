The code snippet `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]` updates the value of `arr[i - 1]` to be equal to the first element of the list `nums`.

Given the initial state, `arr[i - 1]` was previously set to `nums[0]`, and now it remains the same since it's being reassigned to the same value.

No other variables are affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input with `arr[i - 1]` set to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `i` is `m - 2`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` retains its previous value (which could be True or False).**
