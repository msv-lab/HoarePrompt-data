The given code snippet updates the `nums` list by concatenating the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the integer `arr[i]`. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the existing variables.

- `nums` is updated to include the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the integer `arr[i]`.
- `i` remains unchanged as 1.
- `arr`, `n`, `t`, `m`, `a`, and `ans` remain unchanged unless `ans` is set to `False` later in the code, which is not covered by the provided snippet.

Given the initial state, `nums` was initially formed based on the condition `if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`. Now, `nums` is explicitly set to `[int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99; `m` is an input integer and must be at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input line split and converted to integers; `i` is 1; `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[0]` followed by `arr[1]`.**
