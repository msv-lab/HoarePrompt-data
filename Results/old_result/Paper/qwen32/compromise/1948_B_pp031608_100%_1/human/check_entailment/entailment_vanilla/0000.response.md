Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and then reads the array elements.

2. **Logic to Determine Sorted Order:**
   - The program initializes a flag `ans` to `True`, assuming the array can be sorted.
   - It iterates through the array from the end to the beginning (from index `m-1` to `1`).
   - If it finds an element `arr[i]` that is less than the previous element `arr[i-1]`, it checks if splitting `arr[i-1]` and inserting its digits in place would result in a sorted sequence up to that point.
   - Specifically, it constructs a new list `nums` consisting of the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]` and checks if `nums` is sorted.
   - If `nums` is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `nums` is sorted, it updates `arr[i-1]` to the first digit of the split number (`nums[0]`), effectively simulating the operation described in the problem statement.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing each test case, the program prints "YES" if `ans` is `True` (indicating the array can be sorted) and "NO" otherwise.

### Issues in the Provided Program

The main issue with the provided program lies in how it handles the transformation and checking of the array:

- **Transformation Logic:** The program only considers splitting the larger number and checking if the resulting sequence is sorted. However, the problem allows splitting any number greater than or equal to 10, and multiple splits might be needed to achieve a sorted array. The current logic does not account for this possibility.
- **Checking Sorted Sequence:** The program only checks if the immediate sequence after a split is sorted, but it doesn't ensure that the entire array remains sorted after multiple operations.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
