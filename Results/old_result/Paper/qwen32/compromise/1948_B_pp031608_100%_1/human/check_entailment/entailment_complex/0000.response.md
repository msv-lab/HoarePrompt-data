### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine whether it's possible to sort an array by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their constituent digits. The logic in the program is flawed because it only considers the immediate pair of elements and their rearrangement after splitting, without considering the broader implications of the splits on the entire array.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Pairwise Comparison**: The program checks if an element is less than its predecessor and attempts to split the predecessor into digits. However, it only checks if the resulting list of digits plus the current element is sorted. This does not guarantee that the entire array can be sorted after performing the operations.

2. **Lack of Global Sorting Check**: After splitting an element, the program should ensure that the entire array remains sorted after the operation. The current implementation does not perform this check.

3. **Inadequate Handling of Multiple Splits**: The program only performs one split per pair of elements. However, multiple splits might be required to achieve a sorted array, and the program does not account for this.

4. **Logic Error in Loop**: The loop iterates from the end of the array to the beginning, checking if the current element is less than the previous one. If so, it splits the previous element and checks if the resulting list is sorted. However, this approach does not correctly handle cases where multiple splits are needed or where splits affect elements further down the array.

### Correctness:

Given the above points, the program does not correctly determine whether the array can be sorted using the specified operations. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
