Reasoning:
The program provided is intended to determine the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time based on the given frequencies and visibility duration.

Let's break down the logic of the program:
1. For each test case, it calculates `mn` as `min(a, b) + m`, which represents the time after which the maximum number of fireworks could be visible simultaneously.
2. It then calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation that are visible at `mn` by performing integer division of `mn` by `a` and `b` respectively.
3. The sum of these two divisions gives the total number of fireworks visible at `mn`.
4. The program adds an additional `1` to this sum if `m` is perfectly divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is `1`. This adjustment seems to be an attempt to account for an additional overlap scenario, but it is not always correct.

The logic for adding `+1` is flawed and does not correctly account for all scenarios where fireworks from both installations could overlap. Specifically, the condition `m % a == 0 and m % b == 0` does not guarantee that fireworks from both installations will overlap at `mn` for an additional minute. This condition is overly restrictive and does not cover all possible overlaps.

For example, consider a scenario where `a = 3`, `b = 4`, and `m = 11`. Here, `mn = min(3, 4) + 11 = 14`. The fireworks launched at times `12` and `13` by the first installation and at times `12` and `16` by the second installation will all be visible at `mn = 14`, resulting in a total of `4` fireworks visible at the same time. However, the provided program would not add the extra `1` because `m` is not divisible by both `a` and `b`.

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly handle all scenarios and, therefore, is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
