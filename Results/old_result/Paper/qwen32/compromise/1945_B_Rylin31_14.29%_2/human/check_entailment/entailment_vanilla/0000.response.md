Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. Each firework is launched by one of two installations, one at intervals of `a` minutes and the other at intervals of `b` minutes. Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch.

### Key Points:
1. **Launch Times**:
   - Fireworks from the first installation are launched at times `a, 2a, 3a, ...`
   - Fireworks from the second installation are launched at times `b, 2b, 3b, ...`
   
2. **Visibility**:
   - A firework launched at time `x` is visible from `x` to `x + m` inclusive.

3. **Objective**:
   - Find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

### Program Analysis:
The given program calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time by considering the following:

1. **Minimum Visibility Time**:
   - `mn = min(a, b) + m`: This calculates the minimum time after which fireworks from both installations will be visible.

2. **Counting Fireworks**:
   - `mn // a`: Counts the number of fireworks from the first installation visible at `mn`.
   - `mn // b`: Counts the number of fireworks from the second installation visible at `mn`.
   - If `m` is a multiple of both `a` and `b` (and `a` and `b` are not `1`), it adds `1` to account for a potential overlap.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Overlap Handling**:
   - The condition `if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1):` is too restrictive. It only considers the scenario where `m` is a multiple of both `a` and `b`, which is not the only case where overlaps can occur.
   
2. **General Overlap**:
   - The program does not correctly account for overlaps between the fireworks launched by the two installations. It should consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine when both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to find the time when both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.
2. Determine the number of fireworks visible at the LCM time and account for overlaps correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the program's logic, it does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time for all cases.

**Correctness: False**
