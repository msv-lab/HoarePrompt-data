The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means the value of `n` will be updated based on the user's input. All other variables (`times`, `t`, `check`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `n` is now assigned the value of the input integer.

Output State: **`times` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `times` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `check` is 2147483647.**
