The given Python code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts those components to integers, and stores them in a list named `data`. This operation affects the variable `data` by assigning it the list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`times` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `times` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `check` is 2147483647; `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
