To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and how it affects the variables based on the initial state provided.

Initial State: `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2.

Code snippet:
```python
l[a[i] - 1] += 1
```

Here's the impact of the code on the variables:
- `i` is 2, so `a[i]` translates to `a[2]`.
- The value at `l[a[2] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

Since the specific values of `a[2]` and the list `l` are not provided, we can only describe the change in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `l[a[2] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**
