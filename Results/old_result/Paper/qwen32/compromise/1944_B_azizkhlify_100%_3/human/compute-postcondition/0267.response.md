Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, `re` is incremented by 1, and `res` contains `a[0]`. The current value of `re` equals `k`. Otherwise, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `l[a[i] - 1]` does not equal 1. The current value of `re` equals `k`.**

In simpler terms: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `re` equals `k`. If `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, then `res` contains `a[0]`. Otherwise, `l[a[i] - 1]` does not equal 1.**
