To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

Initial State: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1

Code Snippet:
```
l[a[i] - 1] = 0
```

The code snippet modifies an element in the list `l` at an index determined by `a[i] - 1`. However, the values of `a` and `l` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe the change in terms of the indices and the values involved.

- `i` is 1, so `a[i]` refers to the element at index 1 of list `a`.
- The value at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is set to 0.

Since the exact values of `a` and `l` are not provided, we can't specify the exact index in `l` that is modified or the exact state of `l` after the modification. However, we know that `l[a[1] - 1]` is set to 0.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l[a[1] - 1]` is 0.**

In natural language: The value of `n` remains greater than 1, and `i` remains 1. The element at index `a[1] - 1` in list `l` is set to 0.
