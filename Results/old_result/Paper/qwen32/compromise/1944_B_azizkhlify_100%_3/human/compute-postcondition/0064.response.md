To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the `print` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `ul` is defined as the total number of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2, multiplied by 2.
2. `k` is a non-zero value.
3. `n` is greater than 0.
4. `i` is 2.
5. If `re` equals `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
6. The values of `re` and `res` remain unchanged based on the condition that if `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, `re` is increased by 1 and `res` contains `a[1]`.

### Focus on the `print` Statement:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- The `print` statement will output the value of `a[i]`, which is `a[2]`, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Conclusion:
The output will be the value of the element at index 2 of the list `a`, followed by a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[2] ** (where `a[2]` is the value of the element at index 2 in the list `a`)
