To determine what will be printed by the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, we need to focus on the value of the variable `i` based on the given initial state.

Given:
- `ul` is the total number of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2, multiplied by 2.
- `res` is a list containing at least one element.
- `i` is the last index processed.
- `re` is the count of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was 1.
- `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

From the precondition, we know that `i` is the last index processed. The value of `i` is explicitly stated, but it is not provided with a specific numerical value. Therefore, we can only describe it as the last index that was processed in the context of the program.

Since the exact numerical value of `i` is not given, the most precise description we can provide is that `i` is the last index processed.

Output: **i (where i is the last index processed)**
