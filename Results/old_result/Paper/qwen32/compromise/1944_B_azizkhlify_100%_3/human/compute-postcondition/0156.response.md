Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1.

From the initial state, we know that `a[i]` is an index that, when decremented by 1, points to an element in the list `l` that has a value of 1. However, the exact values of `n`, `l`, `a`, and `i` are not provided, so we can't determine the exact numerical value of `a[i]`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

This statement will print the value of `a[i]` followed by a space, as indicated by the `end=' '` argument.

Since we know `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, we can infer that `a[i]` is a valid index for the list `l` and that the element at position `a[i] - 1` in `l` is 1. However, without the specific values of `a` and `i`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `a[i]`.

Output: **a[i] (where a[i] is an element of the list a such that l[a[i] - 1] equals 1)**
