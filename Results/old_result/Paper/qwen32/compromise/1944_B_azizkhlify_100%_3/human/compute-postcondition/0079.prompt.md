Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ul` is the total number of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2, multiplied by 2. The loop has either completed all `n` iterations or broken out early if `ul` reached `k * 2`. If `k` is non-zero, the loop completes all `n` iterations or breaks when `re` equals `k`. `i` is the last index processed, `re` is the count of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was 1, `res` contains all such `a[i]`, and `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`. If `k` is zero, the loop does not execute further.
Code of the loop:
for i in res:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ul` is the total number of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2, multiplied by 2, `res` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the last index processed, `re` is the count of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was 1, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ul` is the total number of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2, multiplied by 2, `res` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the next element in `res`, `re` is the count of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was 1, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ul` is the total number of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2, multiplied by 2, `res` is a list containing at least two elements, `i` is the next element in `res` after the current one, `re` is the count of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was 1, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
