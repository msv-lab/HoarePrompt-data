The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.

The state of `ul`, `k`, `l`, and `a` are not part of the loop head and therefore should not be adjusted.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
