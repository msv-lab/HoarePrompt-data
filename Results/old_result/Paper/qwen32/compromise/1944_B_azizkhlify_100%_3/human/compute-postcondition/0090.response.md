The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `n` must be less than `2 * n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be increased by 1, making `i` equal to `n + 1`.

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be less than `2 * n`**
