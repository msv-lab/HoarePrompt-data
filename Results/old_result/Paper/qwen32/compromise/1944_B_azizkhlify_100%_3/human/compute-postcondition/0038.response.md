To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- The code snippet is: `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.

### Key Points:
- The variable `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact values.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, meaning we need to know the value of `i` before this increment to determine its current value.
- The `print` statement will output `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, and will not end with a newline character (`end=' '`).

### Analysis:
- Since `a` is not defined, we don't know the specific values that `a[i]` will hold.
- The increment of `i` means that `i` is now one more than its previous value. If `i` was 0 before, it is now 1. If `i` was 1, it is now 2, and so on.
- The `print` statement will output the value at index `i` of the list `a` twice, followed by a space.

### Conclusion:
Without the specific values of `a` and the previous value of `i`, we can only describe the output in terms of `a` and `i`.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a is the list and i is the current index after being incremented by 1)**
