To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State:
- `i` is defined as `n + 2`.
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- The list `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we do not know its contents.

### Analysis:
- Since `n` is greater than 2, `i` will be at least 4 (because `i = n + 2`).
- The `print` statement is `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`, which means it will print the element at index `i` of the list `a` twice, separated by a space, and without a newline at the end.

### Output:
Given that the list `a` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values at index `i`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the list `a` and the index `i`.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where i is n + 2 and a is the list containing the elements)**
