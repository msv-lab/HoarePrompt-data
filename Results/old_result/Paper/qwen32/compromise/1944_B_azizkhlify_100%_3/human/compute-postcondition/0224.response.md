The code snippet `l[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at the index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so the value at `l[a[1] - 1]` will be incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, the value at `l[a[0] - 1]` is incremented by 1, and the value at `l[a[1] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

Natural language: The value at index `a[1] - 1` in the list `l` has been incremented by 1. The value at index `a[0] - 1` in the list `l` has also been incremented by 1, as per the initial state. The value of `n` remains greater than 1, and `i` remains 1.
