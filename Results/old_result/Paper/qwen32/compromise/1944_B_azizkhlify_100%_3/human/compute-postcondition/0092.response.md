The line of code `r[a[i] - 1] = 0` sets the element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` to `0`. 

Given that `i` is `n + 1`, the specific value of `i` depends on `n`, but it does not change the fact that `i` is `n + 1`. The precondition `n` must be less than `2 * n` is still valid and does not change.

The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to `0`, but without specific values for `a[i]`, we can only say that the element at the index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` is now `0`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be less than `2 * n`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is `0`**.
