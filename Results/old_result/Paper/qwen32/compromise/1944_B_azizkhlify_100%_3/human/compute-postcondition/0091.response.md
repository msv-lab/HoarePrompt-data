To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the code.

Initial State:
- `i` is defined as `n + 1`.
- It is mentioned that `n` must be less than `2 * n`. This condition is always true for any positive integer `n` and does not provide additional constraints on `n` or `i`.

Given Code:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

Analysis:
- The code attempts to print the element at index `i` of the list `a` twice, separated by a space, and does not print a newline at the end.
- `i` is defined as `n + 1`. Therefore, the code is trying to access the element at index `n + 1` of the list `a`.

However, the initial state does not provide information about the list `a` or the value of `n`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values of `a[i]` without this information.

Output Description:
- The output will be the element at index `i` (which is `n + 1`) of the list `a`, printed twice, separated by a space, and no newline at the end.

Given the lack of specific values for `a` and `n`, the most precise description we can provide is in terms of `a` and `i`:

Output: **a[n + 1] a[n + 1] (where a is the list and n + 1 is the index)**
