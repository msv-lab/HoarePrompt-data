Postcondition: **All elements of `res` have been printed, and `i` is the last element of `res`. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then `i` is `2 * n - 1`, and `ur` is incremented by 2 for each iteration where `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2. `re`, `ul`, `r`, `a`, and `k` remain unchanged. Otherwise, no changes are made to any variables.**
