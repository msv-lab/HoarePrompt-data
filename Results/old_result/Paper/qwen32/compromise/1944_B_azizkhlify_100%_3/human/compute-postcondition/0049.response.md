Let's break down the given information and deduce the value that will be printed by the `print` statement.

### Initial State:
- `ul` is the total number of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2, multiplied by 2.
- `k` is a non-zero value.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1.

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is 0.
- `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1. This means `l[a[0] - 1]` is 1.

However, the value of `a[0]` is not explicitly stated. The print statement only depends on `a[i]`, which is `a[0]` since `i` is 0. Since `l[a[0] - 1]` is 1, we can infer that `a[0] - 1` is an index in the list `l` where the value is 1. But the exact value of `a[0]` is not given.

### The Print Statement:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```
Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` is `a[0]`.

### Conclusion:
The exact value of `a[0]` is not provided in the initial state, so we can't determine a specific numerical value for `a[0]`. However, we can describe the output in terms of `a[0]`.

Output: **a[0] (where a[0] is the first element of the list a)**
