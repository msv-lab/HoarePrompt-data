Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `l[a[i] - 1]` either equals 1 or does not equal 1; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without altering the values of `i`, `n`, or the condition of `l[a[i] - 1]`. Therefore, the state of these variables remains unchanged, and the only change is that the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.
