To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is greater than `i + 1`
2. `i` is updated to `i + 1`

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot know its exact contents. However, we know that `a` is expected to be a list or some other iterable.
- The variable `i` is updated to `i + 1` before the `print` statement is executed. This means that the value of `i` at the time of the print statement is one greater than its previous value.
- The condition `n > i + 1` implies that `i` is still within the valid index range of the list `a` after the increment.

### Output Description:
- The `print` statement will print the element at index `i` of the list `a`, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
- Since the exact elements of `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the element at index `i`.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[i] (where a is a list and i is the updated index value)**
