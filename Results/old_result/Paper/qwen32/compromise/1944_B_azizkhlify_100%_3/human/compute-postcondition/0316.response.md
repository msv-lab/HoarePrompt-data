The code snippet provided is simply a `break` statement, which means it will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is placed within. This does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `r`, and `ur` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the last element of `res` plus 2, `n` is a non-negative integer, and if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `r[a[i] - 1]` remains 2. Otherwise, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0 and `ur` is increased by 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
