The given code snippet modifies the value at a specific index in the list `r`. The index is determined by the value at the current index `i` of the list `a`, minus 1. The value at this index in `r` is set to 0.

Given the initial state, `i` is the last element of `res` plus 1, and `n` is a non-negative integer. The only change in the state is the modification of the list `r` at the index `a[i] - 1`.

Output State: **`i` is the last element of `res` plus 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0.**
