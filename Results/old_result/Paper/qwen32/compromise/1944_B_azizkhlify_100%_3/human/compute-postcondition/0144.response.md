The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

From the given information:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

Since `i` is the loop variable and it is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2. The value of `n` remains the same as it determines the loop's continuation condition.

The state of `ul` and other variables is not directly influenced by the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2**
