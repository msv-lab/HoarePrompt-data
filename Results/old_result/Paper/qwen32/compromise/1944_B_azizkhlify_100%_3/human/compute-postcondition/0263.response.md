Let's break down the given information and determine what will be printed by the `print` statement.

### Given Information:
1. `i` is 0.
2. `n` must be greater than 0.
3. `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1.

### Analysis:
- We know that `i` is 0. So, `a[i]` is simply `a[0]`.
- The condition `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1 tells us that the element at index `a[0] - 1` in the list `l` is 1.
- However, we do not have explicit values for the list `a` or the list `l`.

### What We Can Determine:
- `a[0]` must be a positive integer because `a[0] - 1` is used as an index in the list `l`, and indices in Python must be non-negative integers.
- Since `l[a[0] - 1]` equals 1, `a[0] - 1` is a valid index in the list `l` and the element at that index is 1.

### What We Cannot Determine:
- The exact value of `a[0]` because we do not have the full list `a`.
- The full list `l` or its other elements.

### Conclusion:
Given the information, we can only determine that `a[0]` is a positive integer such that `l[a[0] - 1]` is 1. The exact value of `a[0]` is not known from the given information.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the value of `a[0]` followed by a space.

Output: **a[0] (where a[0] is a positive integer such that l[a[0] - 1] equals 1)**
