The code snippet `ur += 2` increments the value of `ur` by 2. Since the initial state does not provide any specific value for `ur`, we can only state that after the execution, `ur` will be 2 more than its initial value. The other variables (`res`, `n`, `r[a[i] - 1]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is empty, `n` must be a non-negative integer, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, `ur` is increased by 2.**
