The `break` statement will cause the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is contained within, but it does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `i`, and `ul` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `ul` is increased by 2 if `l[a[1] - 1]` is 0 (otherwise, `ul` remains unchanged) still holds.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `ul` is increased by 2 if `l[a[1] - 1]` is 0. Otherwise, `ul` remains unchanged.**
