Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. The logic in the program is flawed.

The program checks if either dimension of the rectangle is even and then tries to cut the rectangle in half along that dimension. However, it fails to account for the possibility of cutting the rectangle into smaller rectangles of different sizes and rearranging them to form a new rectangle.

Here is a more correct approach:

1. If either dimension of the rectangle is even, it can always be cut into two smaller rectangles and rearranged to form a new rectangle. For example, a 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles and rearranged to form a 4x3 rectangle.
2. If both dimensions are odd, it is impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

This code correctly checks if either dimension is even and outputs "Yes" if it is, and "No" otherwise.
