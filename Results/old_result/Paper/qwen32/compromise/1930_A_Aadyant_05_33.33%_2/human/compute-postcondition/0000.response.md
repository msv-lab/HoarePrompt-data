The code snippet `num = input()` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `num`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, and `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^7. Since the input function is used, `num` will hold the input string provided by the user, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7; `num` is a string equal to the user input.**
