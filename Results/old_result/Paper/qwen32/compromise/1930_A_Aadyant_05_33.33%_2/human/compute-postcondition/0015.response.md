The code snippet provided modifies the `list2` by appending an integer value from `list1`. Given the initial state, `list2` already contains two elements, and the code appends another element to it.

Here's the breakdown:
- `list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))` takes the element at the index `2 * i` in `list1`, converts it to an integer, and appends it to `list2`.

Since the initial state specifies that `i` is `i + 1` before this line, the value of `i` is already incremented. Therefore, the element at index `2 * i` in `list1` is being appended to `list2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is an integer such that `a` ≥ 1, `num` is a string representing an integer greater than 0, `out` is an empty list, `list2` contains the integer values of `list1[2 * (i - 1)]`, `list1[2 * i]`, and `list1[2 * (i + 1)]`, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from the input string `b`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
