The code snippet appends an integer value to `list2`. Specifically, it takes the element at the index `2 * i` from `list1` and converts it to an integer before appending it to `list2`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50
- `a` is an integer such that `a` ≥ 1
- `num` is a string representing an integer greater than 0
- `out` is an empty list
- `list2` is an empty list
- `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from the input string `b`

After the execution of the code snippet, `list2` will contain one additional element, which is the integer value of `list1[2 * i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is an integer such that `a` ≥ 1, `num` is a string representing an integer greater than 0, `out` is an empty list, `list2` contains the integer value of `list1[2 * i]`, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from the input string `b`.**
