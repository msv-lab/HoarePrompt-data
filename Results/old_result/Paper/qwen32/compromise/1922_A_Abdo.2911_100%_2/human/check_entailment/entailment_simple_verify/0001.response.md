### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotated version to ensure that the logic aligns with the problem description.

The program aims to determine whether there exists a template `t` such that:
1. Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
2. String `c` does not match the template `t`.

The template `t` can have lowercase or uppercase letters, with the following rules:
- If the template's character is lowercase, the corresponding character in the string must match.
- If the template's character is uppercase, the corresponding character in the string must be different from the lowercase version of the template's character.

The provided program iterates through each character position `i` of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` and checks the following:
1. If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` to ensure `c` does not match the template, while `a` and `b` do.
2. If `a[i] != b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]` to ensure `c` does not match the template, while `a` and `b` can match the template with a template character that is uppercase.

Let's review the annotated code and the logic:

```python
func_1()

#State of the program right before the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and a, b, and c are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        possible = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                if c[i] != a[i]:
                    possible = True
                    break
            elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
                continue
            else:
                possible = True
                break
        
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: YES if any iteration sets `possible` to `True`, otherwise NO.
```

1. **Case 1:** If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` for the template to be valid. This is correctly handled by the code:
   ```python
   if a[i] == b[i]:
       if c[i] != a[i]:
           possible = True
           break
   ```
   If `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.

2. **Case 2:** If `a[i] != b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]` for the template to be valid. This is correctly handled by the code:
   ```python
   elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
       continue
   else:
       possible = True
       break
   ```
   If `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, it continues to the next iteration. If `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.

The logic in the program correctly checks for the existence of a template that satisfies the conditions for all characters in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if a valid template exists based on the problem description.

Final: **True**
