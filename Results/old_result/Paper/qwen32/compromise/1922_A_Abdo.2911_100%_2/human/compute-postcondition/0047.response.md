The code snippet `a = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, removes any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `a`. This action does not affect the values of `possible`, `_`, `t`, or `n`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`possible` is a boolean, `_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string.**
