The code snippet assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `possible`. The other variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged and their conditions are still valid. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, the element at index `i` in list `a` is not equal to the element at index `i` in list `b`, and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`; `possible` is `True`.**
