The code snippet `b = input().strip()` assigns the value of the stripped input string to the variable `b`. The other variables (`possible`, `_`, `t`, `n`, and `a`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`possible` is a boolean, `_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string.**
