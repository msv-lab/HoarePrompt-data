The code snippet sets `possible` to `False`. Other variables like `_`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The precondition that `_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_` still holds true. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` as input integers and stripped input strings respectively also persist.

Output State: **`possible` is `False`, `_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string, `c` is the stripped input string.**
