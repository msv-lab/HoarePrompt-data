Postcondition: **`t` is an integer value provided by the user input where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the string provided by the user input, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the new input, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace. If the character at position `i` in `a` is equal to the character at position `i` in `b`, `possible` remains `False`. If the character at position `i` in `a` is not equal to the character at position `i` in `b`, `possible` is set to `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` remains `False`.**
