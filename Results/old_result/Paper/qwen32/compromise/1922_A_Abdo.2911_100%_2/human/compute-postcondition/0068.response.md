Postcondition: **`possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, and in this case, `_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` is greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string, `c` is the stripped input string, and `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]`, the state of the variables remains unchanged except that we do not break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
