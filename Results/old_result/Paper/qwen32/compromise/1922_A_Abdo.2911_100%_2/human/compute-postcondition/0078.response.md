The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. The loop does not terminate but continues on with the next iteration. 

In this context, the `continue` statement will skip the remaining part of the current iteration and go to the next iteration of the loop. This means that the value of `_` will not be incremented in this iteration, and the loop will proceed to the next iteration with the current value of `_`.

Output State: **`possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` and `a[i]` equals `b[i]`. If `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`, `possible` is `False` if `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` is `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value in the next iteration, `t` is greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is greater than 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are stripped input strings, and `i` is 2. The loop continues to the next iteration.**
