The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value provided by the user input where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the string provided by the user input, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the new input, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace, `i` is `i + 1`**.
