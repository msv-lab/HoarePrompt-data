The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to be the integer value of the user input. The variables `_` and `t` are not affected by this assignment. The precondition that `_` is incremented by 1 and `t` is greater than the new value of `_` remains valid.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is an input integer**.
