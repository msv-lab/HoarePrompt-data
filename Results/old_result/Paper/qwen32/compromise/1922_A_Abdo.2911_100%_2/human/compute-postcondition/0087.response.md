The initial state provides information about the variables and conditions before the `print` statement is executed. Here's a breakdown:

- `possible` is set to `False`.
- `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, but the exact value of `_` is not critical to the output of the `print` statement.
- `t` is mentioned to be greater than the new value of `_`, but again, this does not affect the `print` statement.
- The key information here is that no iteration met the condition where `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]`, or `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. This condition did not change the value of `possible`, which remained `False`.

The `print('NO')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `possible`, `_`, `t`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
