The code snippet provided updates the value of the variable `c` by reading a new input string and stripping any leading or trailing whitespace from it. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and the previous value of `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value provided by the user input where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `a` is the string provided by the user input, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the new input, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.**
