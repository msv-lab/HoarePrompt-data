Output State: **`t` is an integer value provided by the user input where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the string provided by the user input, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the new input, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace, `possible` is `True`, and for at least one index `i`, `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. Additionally, for each index `i`, `c[i]` is neither equal to `a[i]` nor equal to `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The value of `possible` has been changed from `False` to `True`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
