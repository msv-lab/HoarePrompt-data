Output State: **`possible` is `True`, `_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` is greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string, `c` is the stripped input string, and `i` is 1.**

This means that `possible` has been explicitly set to `True`, while all other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
