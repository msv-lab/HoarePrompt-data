Postcondition: **`t` is an integer value provided by the user input where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the string provided by the user input, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the new input, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, the program continues. Otherwise, `possible` is set to `True` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
