To determine what will be printed, we need to break down the given information and understand the variables and their values based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `ret` is the count of `'@'` characters in `s`.
- `thorn` is 0 if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `thorn` is 2.
- `len` is the input integer.
- `s` is the input list of characters.

### Analysis:
The `print(ret)` statement specifically prints the value of `ret`, which is defined as the count of `'@'` characters in the list `s`.

### Determining `ret`:
- `ret` is calculated by counting the occurrences of `'@'` in the list `s`.
- Since the exact list `s` is not provided, we cannot give a specific numerical value for `ret`, but we know it represents the number of `'@'` characters in `s`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(ret)` statement will output the count of `'@'` characters in the list `s`.

### Final Output:
Output: **ret (where ret is the count of '@' characters in the list `s`)**
