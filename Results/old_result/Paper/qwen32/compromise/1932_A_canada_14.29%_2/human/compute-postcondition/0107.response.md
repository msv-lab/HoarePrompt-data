The code snippet provided sets `thorn` to 0. This change affects the variable `thorn` directly, while the other variables (`ret`, `len`, `s`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ret` is 2 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 1 if `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` remains 0; `thorn` is 0; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters; `i` is the second character in the list `s`.**
