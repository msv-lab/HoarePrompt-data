Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is equal to `t`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, and `i` is the next character in the list `s`. If `i` was '*', `thorn` is incremented by 1, making it 3 if it was 2 before the increment, otherwise it remains 2. If `i` was not '*', `ret` and `thorn` depend on the value of the new `i`.**
