Output State: **`ret` is 2 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 1; `thorn` is 0; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `i` is the next character in the list `s`.**

Explanation: The value of `ret` is incremented by 1. If `ret` was initially 1 (when the current character `i` is '@'), it becomes 2. If `ret` was initially 0 (when the current character `i` is not '@'), it becomes 1. The other variables (`thorn`, `len`, `s`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
