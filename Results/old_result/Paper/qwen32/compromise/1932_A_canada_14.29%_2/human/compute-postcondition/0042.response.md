The code snippet `ret = 0` resets the value of `ret` to 0, regardless of its previous value. The values of `s`, `thorn`, and `len` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string; `ret` is 0; `thorn` is 0 if no two consecutive `'*'` characters are found, otherwise `thorn` is 2; `len` is an input integer.**
