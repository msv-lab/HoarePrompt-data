Postcondition: **`ret` is 3 if the second character `i` is `'@'`, otherwise `ret` is 1 if `i` is `'@'`, otherwise `ret` remains 0. `thorn` is 0 if `i` is `'@'`, `thorn` is 1 if the original `thorn` was 0 and `i` is '*', `thorn` is 3 if the original `thorn` was 2 and `i` is '*', `thorn` is 4 if the original `thorn` was 3 and `i` is '*', `thorn` is 2 if `i` is '*' and the original `thorn` was not 2, otherwise `thorn` remains 0. `len` is an input integer. `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters. `i` is the second character in the list `s`. If `thorn` was 2 and `i` is '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
