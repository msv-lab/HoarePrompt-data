The code snippet provided initializes a variable `ret` to 0. The other variables (`t`, `len`, and `s`) are not modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the initial state of `t`, `len`, and `s`, with the addition of `ret` being set to 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is equal to `t`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `ret` is 0.**
