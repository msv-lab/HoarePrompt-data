To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given information step by step.

Initial State:
- `ret` is the count of '@' in the string `s`.
- `thorn` is set to 2 if a loop breaks due to encountering a newline character ('\n').

However, the `thorn` variable is not used in the `print` statement provided. The `print` statement only involves the `ret` variable.

Given that `ret` is defined as the count of '@' characters in the string `s`, the output of the `print` statement will be the integer value representing the number of '@' characters in `s`.

Since the exact content of the string `s` is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `ret`. However, we know that `ret` is the count of '@' characters in `s`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the value of `ret`.

Output: **ret (where ret is the count of '@' characters in the string s)**
