Output State: **`ret` is 1 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` remains 0; `thorn` is 0; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `i` is the next character in the list `s`.**

Explanation: The value of `thorn` is explicitly set to 0 by the code snippet. The values of `ret`, `len`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code.
