### Reasoning:

The given program aims to compute the maximum profit Bob can obtain from selling his buns under the provided promotion rules. Let's break down the logic and verify if it aligns with the problem description.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.

2. **Determining `k`:**
   - The variable `k` is set to `min(n, b - a)`. This choice of `k` makes sense because:
     - `k` cannot exceed the number of buns `n`.
     - `k` also cannot exceed `b - a` because the price of the `i-th` bun would become non-positive if `k > b - a` (since the price of the `i-th` bun is `b - i + 1`).

3. **Calculating Profit:**
   - If `b <= a`, then selling all buns at the usual price `a` is optimal, and the profit is simply `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, the profit is calculated as:
     - The sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time: `b + (b - 1) + (b - 2) + ... + (b - k + 1)`. This sum can be computed using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence: `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
     - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`, contributing `(n - k) * a` to the profit.
   - The total profit is the sum of the two parts: `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated profit for each test case.

### Verification Against Example Test Cases:

- **First Test Case:** `n = 4, a = 4, b = 5`
  - `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = 1`
  - Profit = `5 * 1 - 1 * (1 - 1) // 2 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`
  - Correct.

- **Second Test Case:** `n = 5, a = 5, b = 9`
  - `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = 5`
  - Profit = `9 * 5 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 45 - 10 = 35`
  - Correct.

- **Third Test Case:** `n = 10, a = 10, b = 5`
  - `k = min(10, 5 - 10) = 0`
  - Profit = `10 * 10 = 100`
  - Correct.

- **Fourth Test Case:** `n = 5, a = 5, b = 11`
  - `k = min(5, 11 - 5) = 5`
  - Profit = `11 * 5 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 55 - 10 = 45`
  - Correct.

- **Fifth Test Case:** `n = 10^9, a = 10^9, b = 10^9`
  - `k = min(10^9, 10^9 - 10^9) = 0`
  - Profit = `10^9 * 10^9 = 10^18`
  - Correct.

- **Sixth Test Case:** `n = 10^9, a = 10^9, b = 1`
  - `k = min(10^9, 1 - 10^9) = 0`
  - Profit = `10^9 * 10^9 = 10^18`
  - Correct.

- **Seventh Test Case:** `n = 1000, a = 1, b = 1000`
  - `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1) = 999`
  - Profit = `1000 * 999 - 999 * (999 - 1) // 2 + (1000 - 999) * 1 = 999000 - 498501 + 1 = 499500 + 1 = 500500`
  - Correct.

### Conclusion:

The program logic is correct and aligns with the problem requirements. The calculations for the profit are accurate and handle all edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
