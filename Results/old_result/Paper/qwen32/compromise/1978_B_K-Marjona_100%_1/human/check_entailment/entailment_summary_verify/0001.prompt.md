You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on these inputs. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `a` multiplied by `n`. Otherwise, it computes a more complex expression involving `b`, `a`, and `n` and prints the result.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis
Bob is selling buns with a regular price `a` and a promotional price that starts at `b` for the first bun and decreases by 1 for each subsequent bun sold in the promotional phase. We need to determine the maximum profit Bob can achieve by selling all `n` buns, where `k` buns are sold in the promotional phase.

### Key Observations:
1. **Promotional Pricing:** The price of the i-th bun sold in the promotional phase is `(b - i + 1)`.
2. **Profit Calculation:** The profit from the promotional phase can be calculated as the sum of an arithmetic series: `b + (b-1) + (b-2) + ... + (b-k+1)`.
3. **Regular Pricing:** The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the regular price `a`.
4. **Maximizing Profit:** The optimal `k` should be chosen such that the profit from the promotional phase plus the profit from the regular phase is maximized.

### Mathematical Derivation:
- The sum of the promotional prices can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `S = k * b - (k * (k - 1)) / 2`.
- The total profit `P` is given by the sum of the promotional prices and the regular prices: `P = (k * b - (k * (k - 1)) / 2) + (n - k) * a`.

### Conditions:
- If `b <= a`, selling all buns at the regular price `a` will yield the maximum profit.
- Otherwise, we need to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates the optimal `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. If `b <= a`, it directly calculates the profit as `a * n`. Otherwise, it calculates the profit using the derived formula and prints it.

### Issues in the Program:
The calculation of `k` as `min(n, b - a)` is incorrect. The optimal `k` should be determined by maximizing the profit function, not just by taking the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. The optimal `k` can be found by analyzing the profit function more carefully, but for the given problem constraints, the program's approach is flawed.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly determine the optimal `k` for maximizing the profit. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
