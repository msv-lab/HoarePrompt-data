### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the logic of the provided program to determine if it is correct.

**Objective:**
Bob wants to maximize his profit by selling `n` buns. He can sell the first `k` buns at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b-k+1`, and the remaining `n-k` buns at the usual price `a`.

**Logic in the Program:**
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Determine `k`:**
   - The program calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This is because:
     - If `b - a` is less than `n`, then selling more than `b - a` buns with decreasing prices won't make sense because the price would drop below the usual price `a`.
     - If `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, then Bob can sell all `n` buns at decreasing prices.

3. **Calculate Profit:**
   - If `b <= a`, it means selling at the modified price doesn't give any advantage, so Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
   - Otherwise, the profit is calculated as:
     - `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2` is the sum of the arithmetic series representing the modified prices for the first `k` buns.
     - `(n - k) * a` is the revenue from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`.

**Verification with Examples:**
- **First Example (n=4, a=4, b=5):**
  - `k = min(4, 5-4) = 1`
  - Profit = `5*1 - 1*(1-1)//2 + (4-1)*4 = 5 + 12 = 17`
- **Second Example (n=5, a=5, b=9):**
  - `k = min(5, 9-5) = 4`
  - Profit = `9*4 - 4*(4-1)//2 + (5-4)*5 = 36 - 6 + 5 = 35`
- **Third Example (n=10, a=10, b=5):**
  - `k = min(10, 5-10) = 0`
  - Profit = `10*10 = 100`
- **Fourth Example (n=5, a=5, b=11):**
  - `k = min(5, 11-5) = 5`
  - Profit = `11*5 - 5*(5-1)//2 + (5-5)*5 = 55 - 10 = 45`
- **Fifth Example (n=10^9, a=10^9, b=10^9):**
  - `k = min(10^9, 10^9-10^9) = 0`
  - Profit = `10^9*10^9 = 10^18`
- **Sixth Example (n=10^9, a=10^9, b=1):**
  - `k = min(10^9, 1-10^9) = 0`
  - Profit = `10^9*10^9 = 10^18`
- **Seventh Example (n=1000, a=1, b=1000):**
  - `k = min(1000, 1000-1) = 999`
  - Profit = `1000*999 - 999*(999-1)//2 + (1000-999)*1 = 999000 - 498501 + 1 = 500500`

The program matches the expected results for all provided examples.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling the buns under the given conditions.

**Correctness: True**
