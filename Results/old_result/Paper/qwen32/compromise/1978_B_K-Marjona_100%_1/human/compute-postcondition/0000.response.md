The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate over the range specified by `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`, which corresponds to `t` in the given state.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The state of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not directly relevant to the execution of the loop itself; they are mentioned as part of the context for each test case within the loop.

Given the loop head only involves `_` and the range determined by `int(input())`, we need to ensure that `t` is such that `int(input())` returns a value that makes the loop execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
