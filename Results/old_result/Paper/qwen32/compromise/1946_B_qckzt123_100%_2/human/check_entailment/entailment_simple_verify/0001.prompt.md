You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic step by step:

### Problem Understanding:
We need to maximize the sum of an array `a` after performing `k` operations. Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, calculating its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array. The goal is to maximize the final sum of the array modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Key Observations:
1. **Maximizing the Sum:** To maximize the sum, we should focus on adding the largest possible positive sums repeatedly.
2. **Subarray Selection:** The optimal strategy is to identify the maximum subarray sum using Kadane’s algorithm, which efficiently finds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.
3. **Operation Strategy:** After identifying the maximum subarray sum (`t`), we can repeatedly add this sum to the array. Since we can insert the sum anywhere, the best strategy is to keep doubling the maximum subarray sum and adding it to the total sum until we've performed `k` operations.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:** The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the array `a`.
2. **Calculating Initial Sum (`s`):** The program calculates the initial sum of the array `a`.
3. **Finding Maximum Subarray Sum (`t`):** The program uses a variation of Kadane’s algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum `t`. This is done by iterating through the array and maintaining a running sum `tmp`, resetting it to 0 whenever it becomes negative, and updating `t` with the maximum value of `tmp`.
4. **Calculating Final Answer:**
   - The initial answer is calculated as `(s + t) % MOD`.
   - For the remaining `k-1` operations, the program doubles the maximum subarray sum `t` and adds it to the answer, taking care to apply the modulo operation at each step to prevent overflow.

### Edge Cases Considered:
- **Negative Numbers:** The program handles arrays with negative numbers correctly by resetting the running sum `tmp` to 0 when it becomes negative.
- **Zero Operations:** If `k` is 1, the program simply returns the sum of the array plus the maximum subarray sum.
- **Large Numbers:** The program uses modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers, ensuring the result fits within standard integer limits.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations, considering all necessary edge cases and constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
