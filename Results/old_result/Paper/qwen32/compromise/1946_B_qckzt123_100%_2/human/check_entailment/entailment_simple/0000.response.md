### Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem by calculating the maximum possible sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations. Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after these operations.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the logic used in the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n`, the number of operations `k`, and the array `a`.

2. **Calculating the Initial Sum (`s`):**
   - It calculates the sum of all elements in the array `a` and stores it in `s`.

3. **Finding the Maximum Subarray Sum (`t`):**
   - It uses Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within `a`. This is stored in `t`.

4. **Calculating the Final Answer (`ans`):**
   - The initial answer is calculated as `(s + t) % MOD`. Here, `s` is the sum of the array, and `t` is the maximum subarray sum.
   - For each of the remaining `k-1` operations, the maximum subarray sum `t` is doubled and added to `ans`. This doubling represents the fact that we can repeatedly add the maximum subarray sum to the array, effectively maximizing the total sum.

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - All calculations are done modulo `10^9 + 7` to ensure the result fits within the required constraints.
