The code snippet `t *= 2` multiplies the current value of `t` by 2. Given the initial state, `t` is already calculated as `((2 times the maximum subarray sum of `a`) % 1000000007) * 2 % 1000000007`. After multiplying `t` by 2, the new value of `t` will be `(((2 times the maximum subarray sum of `a`) % 1000000007) * 2 % 1000000007) * 2 % 1000000007`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1; `t` is `(((2 times the maximum subarray sum of `a`) % 1000000007) * 2 % 1000000007) * 2 % 1000000007`; `tmp` is 0; `n` is an integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer read from input where 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `MOD` is 1000000007; `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD + t`; `i` is 2**
