The code snippet provided is `tmp += x`. However, there is no variable `x` defined in the initial state. Given the context, we assume `x` should be defined or its value should be provided. Since `x` is not specified, we cannot compute a specific new value for `tmp`. 

However, if we hypothetically consider `x` to be a known value, the operation would simply add `x` to the current value of `tmp`.

Given the lack of a definition for `x`, the only change we can definitively state is that `tmp` will be updated to `tmp + x`.

Since `x` is not provided, we cannot give a specific numerical value for `tmp`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `tmp` has been updated but without a specific new value.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is 0, `tmp` is `tmp + x`, `n` is the first integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is the new list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of all elements in the new list `a`, `ans` is `(((s + t_initial) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t_initial * (2^(k-1) - 1)) % MOD`**
