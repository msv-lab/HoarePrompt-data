To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the calculations involved:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `T`: Greater than or equal to 0 (though it's not directly used in the calculation of `ans`).
   - `t`: Calculated as `(2^(k-1) * t) % MOD`. Here, `t` is likely an initial value, but since it's not explicitly stated, we'll consider it as part of the calculation.
   - `tmp`: Cumulative sum of the last contiguous subarray with non-negative sums. This is not directly used in the calculation of `ans`.
   - `n`: First integer read from input (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), representing the number of integers in the list `a`.
   - `k`: Second integer read from input (1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5), used in the calculation of `t` and `ans`.
   - `a`: List of `n` integers read from input, where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.
   - `MOD`: A constant value of 1000000007, used for taking modulo in calculations to prevent overflow.
   - `s`: Sum of all elements in the list `a`.
   - `ans`: Calculated as `(s + t * (2^k - 1)) % MOD`.

2. **Calculation of `ans`:**
   - `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
   - `t` is calculated as `(2^(k-1) * t) % MOD`. Since the initial value of `t` is not specified, we'll denote it as `t_initial`.
   - `ans` is then calculated as `(s + t_initial * (2^k - 1)) % MOD`.

Given these details, the output of the `print(ans)` statement will be the value of `ans` as calculated above.

Output: **ans (where ans is calculated as (s + t_initial * (2^k - 1)) % MOD, s is the sum of all elements in the list a, t_initial is the initial value of t, k is the second integer read from input, and MOD is 1000000007)**
