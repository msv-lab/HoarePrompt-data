The given code snippet modifies the variable `ans` by taking its modulo with `MOD`. Since `ans` is already calculated as `(s + 2 * t) % MOD`, taking `ans %= MOD` again does not change its value because `ans` is already within the range defined by `MOD`.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the initial state for `ans`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is the maximum value of `tmp` encountered during the loop multiplied by 2, then taken modulo `MOD`, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last contiguous subarray with non-negative sums, `n` is the first integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from input where 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is the new list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of all elements in the new list `a`, `ans` is `(s + 2 * t) % MOD`.**
