Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is the maximum subarray sum found, `tmp` is 0, `n` is the first integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is the new list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of all elements in the new list `a`, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `x` is the last element in the list `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k - 1):
    t *= 2
    t %= MOD
    ans += t
    ans %= MOD


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is the maximum subarray sum found multiplied by 2 modulo 1000000007, `tmp` is 0, `n` is the first integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` must be at least 2, `a` is the new list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of all elements in the new list `a`, `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD` recalculated to be within the range of 0 to 1000000006, `x` is the last element in the list `a`, `i` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is `((the maximum subarray sum found multiplied by 2 modulo 1000000007) * 2) % 1000000007`, `tmp` is 0, `n` is the first integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` must be at least 2, `a` is the new list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of all elements in the new list `a`, `ans` is a value between 0 and 1000000006, `x` is the last element in the list `a`, `i` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is `(((the maximum subarray sum found multiplied by 2 modulo 1000000007) * 2) * 2) % 1000000007 % 1000000007`, `tmp` is 0, `n` is the first integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` must be at least 2, `a` is the new list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of all elements in the new list `a`, `ans` is a value between 0 and 1000000006, `x` is the last element in the list `a`, `i` is 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
