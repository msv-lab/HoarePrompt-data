The code snippet `t %= MOD` modifies the value of `t` by taking its modulus with `MOD`. This operation ensures that `t` remains within the range defined by `MOD`.

Given the initial state, `t` is the maximum value of `tmp` encountered during the loop multiplied by 2. After applying the modulus operation, `t` will be updated to `t % MOD`.

The other variables (`T`, `tmp`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `MOD`, `s`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is the maximum value of `tmp` encountered during the loop multiplied by 2, then taken modulo `MOD`, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last contiguous subarray with non-negative sums, `n` is the first integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from input where 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is the new list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of all elements in the new list `a`, `ans` is `(s + t) % MOD`**.
