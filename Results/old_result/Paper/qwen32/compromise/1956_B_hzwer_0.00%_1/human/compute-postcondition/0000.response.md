The code snippet provided reads an integer `n` from the standard input. This integer represents the number of cards in a test case. The initial state mentions that the function `func_1()` is expected to handle multiple test cases, and each test case has its own value of `n` and a sequence of integers.

After executing the line `n = int(input())`, the value of `n` is updated to the integer read from the input. This value is specific to the current test case being processed. The other parts of the initial state, such as the number of test cases `t` and the sequence of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, remain unchanged for the current test case.

Output State: **`n` is the integer read from the input, representing the number of cards in the current test case. The number of test cases `t` and the sequence of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are still to be read and are not affected by this line of code.**
