The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i][j]` based on the maximum value among three expressions: `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. The values of `n`, `cards`, `dp`, and `j` are affected as follows:

- `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.
- `j` is incremented by 1.

The other variables (`n`, `cards`, and the other elements of `dp` not directly involved in this update) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])`, and `j` is incremented by 1.**
