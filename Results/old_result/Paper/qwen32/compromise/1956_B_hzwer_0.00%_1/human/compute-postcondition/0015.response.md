Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, and `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where each element is `0` except `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` which are `0`. If the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is `0`, then `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `cards` contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])`. Other elements of `dp` remain `0` except `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` which are `0`.**
