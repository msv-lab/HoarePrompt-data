Postcondition: **The `dp` table is fully updated after `n` iterations of the loop, with each `dp[i][j]` value calculated based on the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list and the rules provided in the loop body. Specifically, if the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is 1, `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` is set to `max(dp[n - 2][n - 1], dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1)`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])`. The initial values of `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` remain `0`, and all other elements of `dp` are updated according to the loop logic. `i` is `n - 3`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is `n - 1`. The count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is greater than 0.**
