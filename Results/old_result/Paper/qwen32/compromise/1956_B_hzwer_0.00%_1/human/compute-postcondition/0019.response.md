Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])`, `j` is decremented by 1 from its current value.**

In this output state, the value of `dp[i][j]` has been updated based on the maximum of three possible values: `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. The value of `j` has been decremented by 1. All other variables and their properties remain unchanged.
