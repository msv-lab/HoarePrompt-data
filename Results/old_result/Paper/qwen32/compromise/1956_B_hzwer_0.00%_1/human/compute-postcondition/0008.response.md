The code snippet assigns the value of `dp[i + 1][j]` to `dp[i][j]`. Given the initial state, the only specific values provided are `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]`, both of which are `0`. Since the code does not specify the values of `i` and `j`, we can only infer the change in `dp[i][j]` based on the given information.

The output state will reflect that `dp[i][j]` now holds the value of `dp[i + 1][j]`. All other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where each element is `0` except `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` which are `0`. The count of `j + 1` in `cards` is `0`. `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`.**
