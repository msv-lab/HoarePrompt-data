The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, the loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be decremented by 1.

State: **The `dp` table is fully updated after `n` iterations of the loop, with each `dp[i][j]` value calculated based on the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list and the rules provided in the loop body. `i` is `n - 3`, `n` must be at least `1`, and `j` is `n - 3`. If the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is 0, `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is 1, `dp[i][j]` is `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])`.**
