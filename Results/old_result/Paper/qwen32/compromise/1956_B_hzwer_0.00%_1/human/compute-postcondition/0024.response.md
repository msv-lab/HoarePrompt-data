The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i][j]` based on the maximum of two values: `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. The values of `n`, `cards`, and `i` are not explicitly changed by this code snippet, but `j` is incremented by 1 from its current value before the snippet is executed. Therefore, after the execution of the code snippet, the value of `dp[i][j]` will be updated, but `n`, `cards`, and `i` will remain the same. The value of `j` is not directly affected by this snippet but is described as incremented in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)`, and `j` is incremented by 1 from its current value.**
