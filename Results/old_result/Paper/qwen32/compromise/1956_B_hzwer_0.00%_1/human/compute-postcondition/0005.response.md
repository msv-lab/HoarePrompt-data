To ensure that the `for` loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will iterate from `n - 3` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing `i` by `1` in each iteration.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `n`**: This is the upper bound for the loop. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least `3` because the loop starts at `n - 3`. If `n` is less than `3`, the starting index `n - 3` would be negative, and the loop would not execute.

2. **Variable `i`**: The loop variable `i` is initialized to `n - 3` and decremented until it reaches `0`. Before the loop starts, `i` does not need to be explicitly set because it is initialized within the loop head. However, for the sake of clarity and understanding the state, we can consider `i` to be `n - 3` at the start of the loop.

Given these considerations, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least `3`, so that the loop can execute.

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where each element is `0` except `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` which are `0`**.
