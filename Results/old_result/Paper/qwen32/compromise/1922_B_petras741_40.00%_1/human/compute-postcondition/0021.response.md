The code `eta.append(j)` adds the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Given that `j` is 4, `eta` will now contain the element 4. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer with a value greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `w`, `eta` is a list containing the single element 4, `j` is 4**.
