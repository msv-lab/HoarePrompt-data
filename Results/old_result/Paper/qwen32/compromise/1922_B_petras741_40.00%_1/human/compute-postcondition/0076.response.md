The code snippet provided appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Since `j` is 1 as per the initial state, the list `eta` will now contain the element 0 (as per the initial state) followed by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i + 1` if `n` was less than 3, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with the element at index `w[j]` incremented by `n` for each occurrence of `w[j]` in `w`, `eta` is a list containing the elements 0 and 1, `eta_ln`, `rho`, `res` are unchanged or not defined if `n` is less than 3, and `j` is 1**.
