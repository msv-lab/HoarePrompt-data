The code snippet `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Since `eta` was initially an empty list, after executing the code, `eta` will contain the single element `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer with a value greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `w`, `eta` is a list containing the single element `j`, and `q[j]` is greater than 0.**
