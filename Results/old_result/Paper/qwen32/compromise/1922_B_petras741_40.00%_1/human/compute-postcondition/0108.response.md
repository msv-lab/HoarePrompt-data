Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **t**: The number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
2. **buffer**: An empty list.
3. **n**: An integer greater than 0.
4. **w**: A list of integers obtained from the input.
5. **i**: This variable is incremented by 1 if `n` was less than 3. However, this variable is not used in the provided code snippet, so its value does not affect the output.
6. **q**: A list of `n + 1` zeros. For each occurrence of an integer `w[j]` in `w`, the element at index `w[j]` in `q` is incremented by `n`.
7. **eta**: A list containing all indices `j` (0 ≤ j ≤ n) where `q[j] > 0`.
8. **eta_ln**: The length of `eta` and must be greater than 1.
9. **rho**: The sum of `q[eta[j]]` for all `j` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1`.
10. **res**: The sum of two expressions for all `j` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1`:
    - `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6`
    - `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`
11. **j**: This variable is set to `eta_ln - 1` if `eta_ln - 1` is less than or equal to 1000; otherwise, it is set to 1000. However, this variable is not used in the provided code snippet, so its value does not affect the output.

### Calculation of `res`

The variable `res` is calculated based on the list `q` and its non-zero indices stored in `eta`.

- **q**: This list keeps track of the frequency of each integer in `w` scaled by `n`.
- **eta**: This list contains indices of `q` that have non-zero values, meaning these indices correspond to integers in `w` that appear at least once.
- **rho**: This is the sum of the values in `q` at the indices stored in `eta`. Essentially, it represents the total count of all integers in `w` scaled by `n`.
- **res**: This is the sum of two combinatorial expressions for each non-zero value in `q`:
  - The first expression `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` calculates the number of ways to choose 3 items from `q[eta[j]]` items.
  - The second expression `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` calculates the number of ways to choose 2 items from `q[eta[j]]` items and multiplies it by `rho`.

### Conclusion

Given the initial state and the calculations involved, the `print(res)` statement will output the calculated value of `res` based on the input list `w` and the derived values of `q`, `eta`, and `rho`.

Output: **res (where res is the sum of q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 and q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho for all j from 0 to eta_ln - 1)**
