Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is the input integer, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is less than 3, `i` is `i + 1`, and other variables (`q`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, `res`) are unchanged or not defined if `n` is less than 3**
