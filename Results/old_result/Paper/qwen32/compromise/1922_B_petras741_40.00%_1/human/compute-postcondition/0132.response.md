Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a list of integers with length `n`, `i` is the current value of i plus 1, `q` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `w[j]` in `w`, `eta` is a list containing the value of `j` if `q[j]` is greater than 0, otherwise `eta` remains an empty list, and `j` is 1. If `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta` now contains the value `j`.**
