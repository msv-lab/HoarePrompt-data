The only variable in the loop head is `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` must be greater than `j + 2`
- `j` is `j + 1` (which means `j` has been incremented by 1 from the previous value)
- The value at `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 (this does not affect the loop condition directly, so we don't need to adjust it for the loop to execute one more time).

For the loop to execute again:
- `j` should be incremented by 1 from its current value (which is already done from the previous iteration, so `j` is now `j + 1`).
- `n` must be greater than the new value of `j + 1`, which means `n` must be greater than `j + 2`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` must be greater than `j + 2`, `j` is `j + 1`**
