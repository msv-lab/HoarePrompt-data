Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 32 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `s` is a list of characters, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `length` is at least 2, and `nalla` is 32. If `s[i]` was '-1' and `s[i - 1]` was '1', then `s[i]` is now '0' and `s[i - 1]` is now '-1'. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.**
