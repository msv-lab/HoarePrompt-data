Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 32 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `s` is a list of 30 characters where `s[1]` is '-1', `flag` is 1, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 32, `i` is 1.**

In this output state, the only change is that the value of `flag` has been set to 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
