Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 32 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `s` is a list of 31 characters ('1', '0', or '-1') with `s[29]` being '0' and `s[30]` being '1', `flag` is 1, `length` is 31, `nalla` is 32. Either `flag` is 0 or `s[29]` is not '0' is no longer valid as `s[29]` is now '0'.**

Explanation: The value of `length` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 30 to 31. All other variables remain unchanged.
