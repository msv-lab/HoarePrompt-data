Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing the 30-bit binary representation of `x`. If `flag` is 1 and the 30th element of `s` is '0', then the 30th element of `s` is set to '1'. Otherwise, if `flag` is not 0, the 30th bit of `s` is set to '0' and an additional '1' is appended, making `length` 31. If `flag` is 0, `s` remains unchanged with `length` 30. `flag` is not modified if it was not 0 initially, and `nalla` is incremented by 1 in all cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing the 30-bit binary representation of `x` where the 30th element is '0', `flag` is not 0, and `length` is 31. If `s[i]` was originally '-1' and `s[i - 1]` was '1', then the `i`th element of `s` is now '0' and the `i-1`th element of `s` is '-1'. Otherwise, no changes are made to `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing the 30-bit binary representation of `x` where the 30th element is '0'. If `s[6]` was '-1' and `s[5]` was '1', then the 6th element of `s` is now '0'. `flag` is not 0, and `length` is 31, `i` is 6. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing the 30-bit binary representation of `x` where the 30th element is '0', `flag` is not 0, `length` is 31, `i` is 7. If the 8th element (index 7) of `s` is '-1' and the 7th element (index 6) of `s` is '1', then the 8th element (index 7) of `s` is updated to '0'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
