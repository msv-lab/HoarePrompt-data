Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing the 30-bit binary representation of `x` with the first bit changed to '1' if `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` was '0', except `s[0]` is now '0', `flag` is 1, `length` is 30, `nalla` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0. Either `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'. The current value of `flag` is 1.**

In simple terms: The first element of the list `s` is now '0'. All other variables retain their initial values, and the conditions involving `flag` and `s[i]` remain valid.
