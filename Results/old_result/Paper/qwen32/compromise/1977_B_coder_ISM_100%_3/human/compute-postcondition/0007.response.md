Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing one element '1', `length` is 30, and the `i`-th bit of `x` is set (i.e., `(x & pow(2, i))` is true).**

Explanation: The list `s` was initially empty, but after executing `s.append('1')`, it now contains one element, which is the string '1'. All other variables remain unchanged.
