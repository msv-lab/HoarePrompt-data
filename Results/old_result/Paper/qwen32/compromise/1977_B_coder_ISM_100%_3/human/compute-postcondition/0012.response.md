Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing either the string `'1'` or the string `'0'` depending on whether the `i`-th bit of `x` is set or not, with an additional `'1'` appended to it, `length` is 30, `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the list `s` now has one more element `'1'` added to it, while all other variables remain unchanged.
