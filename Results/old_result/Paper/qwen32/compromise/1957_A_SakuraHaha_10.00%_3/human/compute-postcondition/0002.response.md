The code snippet provided only initializes a variable `ans` to 0. It does not modify the values of `t`, `n`, or the list `a`. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks, `ans` is 0.**
