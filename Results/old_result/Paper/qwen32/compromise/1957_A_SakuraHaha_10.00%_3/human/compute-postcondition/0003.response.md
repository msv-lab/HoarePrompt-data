The code snippet initializes a dictionary named `cnt`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `ans`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is an empty dictionary.**
