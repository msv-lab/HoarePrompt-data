The code snippet provided appends the last character of the last element of the list `a` to the `last_row` string. 

Given the initial state, `last_row` is already the concatenation of the original `last_row` and the last character of the newly appended input string. After the code snippet executes, `last_row` will be updated to include an additional character, which is the last character of the last element of `a`.

Since the last element of `a` is described as the "newly appended input string," and `last_row` already includes the last character of this string, appending it again does not change the value of `last_row`. Therefore, the value of `last_row` remains the same as it was before the code snippet executed.

No other variables are affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer read from the input, `a` is a list containing three elements (the original input string, the previously appended input string, and the newly appended input string), `first_row` is the concatenation of the original `first_row` and the first character of the last element of `a`, `last_row` is the concatenation of the original `last_row` and the last character of the newly appended input string, `i` is incremented by 1.**
