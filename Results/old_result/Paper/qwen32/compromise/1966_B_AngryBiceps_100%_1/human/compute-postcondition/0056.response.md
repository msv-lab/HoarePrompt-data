The code snippet initializes an empty list `a`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains the same for `t`, `n`, and `m`, while `a` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers read from input; `a` is an empty list.**
