Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer greater than 0; `m` is an integer read from input; `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being a string input from the user; `first_row` is a string containing the first character of each string in `a` concatenated together; `last_row` is a string containing the last character of each string in `a` concatenated together; `i` is `n`. At least one of the following conditions is true: the first string in `a` does not consist of a single character, the last string in `a` does not consist of a single character, or the first and last strings in `a` are the same. If `first_row` consists of all identical characters, `last_row` consists of all identical characters, and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`, then the if block executes; otherwise, the else block executes. In the else block, either the set of characters in `first_row` is not a single character, or the set of characters in `last_row` is not a single character, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.**
