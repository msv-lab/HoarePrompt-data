The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last string in the list `a` to the variable `first_row`. 

Given the initial state, `first_row` is the first character of the first string in `a`. After executing the code, `first_row` will now be the concatenation of its original value and the first character of the last string in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the new input, `a` is a list containing two elements (the original string and the newly appended string), `first_row` is the first character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
