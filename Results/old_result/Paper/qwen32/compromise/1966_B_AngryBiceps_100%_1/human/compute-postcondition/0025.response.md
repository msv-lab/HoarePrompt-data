Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than 0; `m` is an integer read from the input; `a` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is an input string); `first_row` is a string containing the first character of each of the `n` input strings concatenated together; `last_row` is a string containing the last character of each of the `n` input strings concatenated together. If `first_row` consists of all identical characters, `last_row` consists of all identical characters, and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`, then the conditions related to the if part hold. Otherwise, at least one of the following conditions is true: the first string in `a` does not consist of all identical characters, the last string in `a` does not consist of all identical characters, or the first and last strings in `a` are the same.**
