Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers read from input; `a` is an empty list; `first_row` is an empty string; `last_row` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a.append(input())
    first_row += a[-1][0]
    last_row += a[-1][-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer greater than 0; `m` is an integer read from input; `a` is a list containing one element, which is the string input from the user; `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`; `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer greater than 0; `m` is an integer read from input; `a` is a list containing two elements, the first being the original string input from the user and the second being a new string input from the user; `first_row` is the first character of the original string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the second string in `a`; `last_row` is the last character of the original string in `a` concatenated with the last character of the second string in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer greater than 0; `m` is an integer read from input; `a` is a list containing three elements, the first being the original string input from the user, the second being a new string input from the user, and the third being the newly appended string; `first_row` is the first character of the original string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the second string in `a` and the first character of the third string in `a`; `last_row` is the last character of the original string in `a` concatenated with the last character of the second string in `a` and the last character of the third string in `a`; `i` is `t + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
