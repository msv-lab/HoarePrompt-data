Let's analyze the provided Python program and the problem description step by step to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires determining if a grid of white ('W') and black ('B') squares can be made uniform (all 'W' or all 'B') using a specific operation. The operation allows selecting any two squares of the same color and coloring the entire subrectangle between them with that color.

### Key Observations

1. **Initial Rows and Columns**:
   - If the first row and the last row are both uniform (all 'W' or all 'B') but different from each other, it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform.
   - Similarly, if the first column and the last column are both uniform but different from each other, it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform.

2. **General Case**:
   - If neither the first and last rows nor the first and last columns are both uniform and different, it is possible to make the entire grid uniform.

### Program Analysis

The program follows a strategy based on the above observations:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - It reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the grid and the grid itself.

2. **Checking First and Last Rows**:
   - It constructs a string `first_row` containing the first element of each row.
   - It constructs a string `last_row` containing the last element of each row.

3. **Condition Checks**:
   - It checks if the first row and the last row are both uniform and different from each other.
   - It checks if the first column and the last column are both uniform and different from each other.
   - If either of these conditions is true, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Correctness Verification

Let's verify if the program correctly implements the solution based on the key observations:

1. **First and Last Rows**:
   - The program checks if `len(set(a[0])) == 1` and `len(set(a[-1])) == 1` to determine if the first and last rows are uniform.
   - It then checks if `a[0] != a[-1]` to ensure they are different.

2. **First and Last Columns**:
   - The program constructs `first_row` and `last_row` by concatenating the first and last elements of each row, respectively.
   - It checks if `len(set(first_row)) == 1` and `len(set(last_row)) == 1` to determine if the first and last columns are uniform.
   - It then checks if `first_row != last_row` to ensure they are different.

3. **General Case**:
   - If neither the first and last rows nor the first and last columns are both uniform and different, the program correctly concludes that it is possible to make the entire grid uniform.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic based on the problem's requirements. It checks the necessary conditions for the first and last rows and columns and makes the correct determination based on those checks.

**Correctness: True**
