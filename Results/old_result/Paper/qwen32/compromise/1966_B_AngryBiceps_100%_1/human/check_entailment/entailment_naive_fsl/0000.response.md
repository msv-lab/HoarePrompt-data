Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the described operations. The logic in the program is flawed and does not cover all cases.

Let's analyze the program:

1. **Initial Assumptions and Logic**:
   - The program checks if the first row and the last row of the grid are the same and if they contain only one unique color.
   - It also checks if the first column and the last column of the grid are the same and if they contain only one unique color.
   - If both conditions fail, it prints "YES", otherwise "NO".

2. **Flaws in the Logic**:
   - The program does not consider the entire grid but only the first and last rows and columns. This is insufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made the same color.
   - There could be cases where the first and last rows or columns are the same and contain only one unique color, but the middle part of the grid has a different pattern that cannot be unified using the described operations.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the following grid:
     ```
     3 3
     WWW
     WBW
     WWW
     ```
   - According to the program, the first row and the last row are the same and contain only 'W', so it would print "YES". However, it is impossible to make all squares the same color because the middle row has a 'B' that cannot be changed to 'W' using the described operations.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases correctly.
