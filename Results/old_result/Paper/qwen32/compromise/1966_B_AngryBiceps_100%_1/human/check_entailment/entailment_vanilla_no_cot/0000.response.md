To determine if the provided program is correct based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program and compare it with the requirements of the problem.

The problem states that we can select any two squares of the same color and color all squares in the subrectangle between them with that color. The goal is to determine if it is possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color after performing any number of such operations.

The program's logic is as follows:
1. For each test case, it reads the grid dimensions and the grid itself.
2. It constructs two strings: `first_row` which consists of the first characters of each row, and `last_row` which consists of the last characters of each row.
3. It then checks if the first and last rows are both uniform in color (i.e., all 'W' or all 'B') and different from each other. If so, it prints "NO".
4. Similarly, it checks if the first and last columns are both uniform in color and different from each other. If so, it prints "NO".
5. If neither of the above conditions are met, it prints "YES".

This logic is incorrect because it does not consider all possible configurations of the grid that could prevent making the entire grid uniform. Specifically, the program does not account for cases where there are multiple rows or columns that are uniform in color but not necessarily the first and last rows or columns. For example, if there is a middle row that is all 'W' and a middle column that is all 'B', it is still possible to make the entire grid uniform through a series of operations.

Here is an example that demonstrates the flaw in the logic:
```
3 3
WBB
WBW
BBW
```
In this grid, the first and last rows are not uniform, and the first and last columns are not uniform. However, it is possible to make the entire grid uniform (all 'W' or all 'B') through a series of operations. The program would incorrectly print "YES" for this case because it does not consider the middle row and column.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
