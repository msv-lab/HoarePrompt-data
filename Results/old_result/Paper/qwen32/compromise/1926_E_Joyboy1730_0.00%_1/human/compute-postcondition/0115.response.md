Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` â‰¥ 1; `n` is 0; `L` is a list with at least three elements, `a` is the third element of `L`; `pow` is 8; `m` is 1; `tot` is `tot + 3*a`; `k` is `k - tot`. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains the same as described.**

In this output state, the value of `pow` has been updated to 8, as it was multiplied by 2. All other variables retain their initial values or expressions as described in the initial state.
