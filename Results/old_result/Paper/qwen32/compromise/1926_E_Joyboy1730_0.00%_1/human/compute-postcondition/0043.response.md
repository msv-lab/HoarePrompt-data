To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition specified in the loop head. The `while` loop is:

```
while n:
    # the loop body is omit
```

In Python, a `while` loop will execute as long as the condition evaluates to `True`. The condition here is `n`, which means the loop will execute as long as `n` is not zero (since in Python, any non-zero integer is considered `True`).

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 0 and `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `L` is an empty list.
- `pow` is `2^i` where `i` is the number of iterations completed.
- `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L` up to the point where the loop breaks or finishes.

The only variable in the loop head is `n`. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be a non-zero integer. Since `n` is described as "the first integer from the input," we need to ensure that this integer is not zero.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is a non-zero integer. No other states need to be adjusted because they do not affect the loop condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 0 and `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `n` is a non-zero integer; `k` is the second integer from the input; `L` is an empty list; `pow` is `2^i` where `i` is the number of iterations completed; `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L` up to the point where the loop breaks or finishes.**
