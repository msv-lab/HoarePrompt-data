In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `t`, which represents the number of iterations the loop will perform. The loop head only contains the variable `_` and `t`. The variables `n` and `k` are mentioned in the state description but are not part of the loop head, so they cannot be adjusted to affect whether the loop executes.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop head and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 1, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9**
