Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` â‰¥ 1, `n` is 0, `k` is `k - 2 * tot`, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 4, `tot` is increased by `a` twice, `a` is the next element in `L` after `a_next`. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking.**
