Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` â‰¥ 0 and `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is 0, `k` is the second integer from the input, `L` is a list with at least one element, `pow` is 1, `tot` is `tot + a`. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.**

In natural language: The value of `tot` has been updated to be `tot + a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
