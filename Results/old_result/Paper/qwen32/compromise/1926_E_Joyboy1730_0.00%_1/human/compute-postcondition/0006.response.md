The value of `n` is updated by subtracting `m` from it. Given that `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` will be `n - (n + 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `(n - 1) // 2` if `n` is odd, and `n // 2` if `n` is even. The values of `t`, `k`, `L`, and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 1; `n` is `(n - 1) // 2` if `n` is odd, and `n // 2` if `n` is even; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `L` is an empty list; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
