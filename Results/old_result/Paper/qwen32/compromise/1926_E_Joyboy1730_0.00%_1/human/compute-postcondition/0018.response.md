To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the variables and the expression step by step.

### Given Variables and Conditions:
- `t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 1.
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
- `L` is a list with at least one element.
- `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a` (where `a` is not defined in the initial state, but it doesn't affect the current print statement).
- `pow` is 1.

### Expression to Evaluate:
The print statement is:
```python
print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Values of Variables:**
   - `pow` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).

2. **Evaluate the Expression:**
   - The expression inside the print statement is `pow * (2 * k - 1)`.
   - Substituting the value of `pow`, the expression simplifies to `1 * (2 * k - 1)`, which further simplifies to `2 * k - 1`.

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - The output will be the value of the expression `2 * k - 1`.
   - Since `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, the output will be an integer value that is `2 * k - 1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2 * k - 1 (where k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9)**
