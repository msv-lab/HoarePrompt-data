Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` â‰¥ 1; `n` is 0; `k` is the value provided by the input; `L` is a list with at least one element, `a` is the first element of `L`; `pow` is 1; `m` is 1. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, there is no change to `tot`.**
