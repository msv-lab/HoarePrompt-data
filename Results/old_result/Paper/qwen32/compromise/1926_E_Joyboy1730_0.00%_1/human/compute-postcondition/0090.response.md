The code snippet `n -= m` decrements the value of `n` by the value of `m`. Given the initial state, `n` is 1 and `m` is 1. Therefore, `n` will become 0 after the operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` â‰¥ 1; `n` is 0; `k` is the value provided by the input; `L` is []; `pow` is 1; `tot` is 0; `m` is 1.**
