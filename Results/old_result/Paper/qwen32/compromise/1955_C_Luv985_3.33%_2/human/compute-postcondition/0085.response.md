Output State: **`t` is 5; `T` is non-zero and decreased by 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `k` must be greater than 0; `a` is the list of integers from the input with the first element reduced by `mi` and the last element further reduced by `mi`; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is 0; `mi` is `min(a[0], a[n-1])`; `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`; `k` is `k - mi * 2`.**

In natural language, this means that the value of `k` has been decreased by `mi * 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
