Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1; `k` must be greater than 0 and is now decreased by `mi * 2`; `T` is non-zero and `T` is decreased by 1; `a` is the list of integers from the input with the first element decreased by `mi` and the last element decreased by `mi`; `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` (original) and `a[n-1]`; if `a[l] == 0`, then `l` is 1 and `ans` is incremented by 1, otherwise `l` remains 0; if `a[r] == 0`, then `r` is `n - 2` and `ans` is incremented by 1, otherwise `r` remains `n - 1`.**
