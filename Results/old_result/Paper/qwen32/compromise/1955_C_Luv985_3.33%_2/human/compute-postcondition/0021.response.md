Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `T` is 0; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is a positive integer decreased by `mi * 2`; if `a[l]` was 0, then `a[0]` is 0, `a[n - 1]` is decreased by `mi`, `l` is 1, `ans` is 1; otherwise, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[n - 1]` is decreased by `mi`, `l` is 0, `ans` is 0; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`; `mi * 2` is less than or equal to the original value of `k`. `r` remains `n - 1`.**
