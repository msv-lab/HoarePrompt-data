Output State: **`t` is 0 or 1; `T` is 0; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of integers; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. If `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is increased by 1; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
