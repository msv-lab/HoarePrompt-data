Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `T` is 0; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is a positive integer or a positive integer minus `mi * 2` if the if condition was met; `a` is a list of integers where `a[l]` and `a[r]` may have been decreased by `mi` if the if condition was met; `l` is 0 or 1 if `a[l]` was 0, otherwise `l` remains 0; `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` if `a[r]` was 0, otherwise `r` remains `n - 1` or `n - 2`; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before any potential decrease; `ans` is increased by 1 if either `a[l]` or `a[r]` was 0 or if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`. If the if condition was not met, `t` is 0 or 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
