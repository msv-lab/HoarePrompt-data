Postcondition: **`t` is 5; `T` is non-zero and decreased by 1; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers from the input with the first element reduced by `mi` and the last element further reduced by `mi`. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is 1, `ans` is 1; otherwise, `l` remains 0 and `ans` remains 0. `r` is `n - 1`; `mi` is `min(a[0], a[n-1])`; `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`; `k` is `k - mi * 2`.**
