The code calculates the sum of the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `total_water`. Given that the sum of the elements in `a` is divisible by `n`, `total_water` will hold this sum value. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the sum of a_i is divisible by n; `total_water` is the sum of the list `a`.**
