Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error that could lead to incorrect results in certain cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly handle scenarios where the water distribution cannot be equalized due to the constraints of the operation (pouring water from a lower-indexed container to a higher-indexed container).

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Logic Flaw**: The function checks if the cumulative difference between the current water level and the target water level ever goes negative. If it does, it returns 'No'. However, this logic is flawed because it does not account for the possibility of redistributing water in subsequent steps to balance out the negative difference.

2. **Example Case**:
   Consider the following test case:
   ```
   3
   1 2 3
   ```
   - The total water is 6, and the target for each container is 2.
   - The first container has 1 unit of water, which is 1 unit less than the target.
   - The second container has 2 units of water, which is exactly the target.
   - The third container has 3 units of water, which is 1 unit more than the target.

   According to the logic in `func_1`, the cumulative difference would be:
   - After the first container: `-1` (1 - 2)
   - After the second container: `-1` (1 - 2 + 2 - 2)
   - After the third container: `0` (-1 + 3 - 2)

   Since the cumulative difference never goes negative, the function would return 'Yes', which is incorrect. In reality, it is impossible to make all containers have 2 units of water given the constraint of pouring water from a lower-indexed container to a higher-indexed container.

3. **Correct Approach**: To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that at no point do we try to pour water from a container that already has less water than the target into another container. This requires a more nuanced approach to verify if the water can be redistributed according to the given rules.

Given these points, the program is incorrect for at least one potential case, and thus the correctness is **False**.
