The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `x` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `s` is `s + s // (k - 1) + 1 + (s + s // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 2**
