To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and how the variables are updated. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `s` is updated `x` times using the formula `s = s + s // (k - 1) + 1`.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `x` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `i` is defined as `x - 1`.

2. **Understanding the Update to `s`**:
   - The variable `s` is updated `x` times. The exact value of `s` after these updates depends on its initial value and the values of `k` and `x`.
   - The formula `s = s + s // (k - 1) + 1` is applied iteratively `x` times.

3. **Condition in the Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement checks if `a` is greater than or equal to the final value of `s` after `x` updates.
   - If `a >= s`, it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

4. **Output Description**:
   - Since we do not have the initial value of `s`, `k`, `x`, and `a`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `s` after the updates.
   - However, we can describe the output based on the condition given.

Given the above analysis, the output of the print statement will depend on whether the value of `a` is greater than or equal to the final value of `s` after `x` updates.

Output: **'Yes' if a is greater than or equal to the final value of s after x updates, otherwise 'No'**
