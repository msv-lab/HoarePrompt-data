To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the variable `s` evolves with each iteration of the inner loop. The inner loop updates `s` using the formula:

\[ s = s + \left\lfloor \frac{s}{k - 1} \right\rfloor + 1 \]

where \( s \) starts at 1 and this update happens `x` times for each set of inputs `k`, `x`, and `a`.

The output of the code depends on whether `a` is greater than or equal to the final value of `s` after `x` iterations. If `a >= s`, the output is "Yes"; otherwise, it is "No".

Given the loop runs `t` times (where `t` is the number of test cases), we need to compute the final value of `s` for each test case and compare it with `a`.

Let's summarize the final output state:

1. For each test case, read the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.
2. Initialize `s` to 1.
3. Update `s` using the formula `s = s + s // (k - 1) + 1` for `x` iterations.
4. Compare the final value of `s` with `a` and print "Yes" if `a >= s`, otherwise print "No".

Since the problem asks for the output state after all iterations, the output state will be a series of "Yes" or "No" responses, one for each test case.

Output State: **A series of "Yes" or "No" responses, one for each test case.**

In natural language: The output state after all iterations is a sequence of "Yes" or "No" answers, each corresponding to whether the value of `a` is greater than or equal to the final computed value of `s` for each test case.
