The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. For each test case, it calculates a value `s` based on the values of `k` and `x`, and then checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`. It outputs "Yes" if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, otherwise it outputs "No".
