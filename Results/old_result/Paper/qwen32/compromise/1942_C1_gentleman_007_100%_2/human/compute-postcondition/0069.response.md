The code snippet `l.append(a[i])` modifies the list `l` by appending the element `a[i]` to it. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 0, so `a[i]` is `a[0]`. Therefore, `a[0]` is added to the list `l`.

The initial state specifies that `l` either contains the element `a[0]` if `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i - 1][j]` and not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, or it remains an empty list if `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`. However, since the code snippet unconditionally appends `a[i]` to `l`, the list `l` will now contain `a[0]` regardless of the initial conditions.

The values of `dp`, `i`, `j`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **The `dp` matrix is fully populated with the lengths of the longest common subsequence (LCS) between all prefixes of `a` and `b`. The value at `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` contains the length of the LCS between the entire lists `a` and `b`. `i` is 0. `j` is 0. The list `l` contains the element `a[0]`.**
