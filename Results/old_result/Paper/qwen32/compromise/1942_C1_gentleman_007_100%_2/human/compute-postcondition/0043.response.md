Output State: **`ver` is the vertex that was at the front of `q`, `q` has one more element which is `node`, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 for all vertices that are reachable from the initial `ver` and 0 for all other vertices, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one element, and `vis[node]` is 0.**

In simple terms, the vertex `node` has been added to the queue `q`, making it one element larger. The state of `ver`, `vis`, and `graph[ver]` remains unchanged.
