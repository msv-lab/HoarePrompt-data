Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ver` is the vertex that was at the front of `q`, `q` has one less element, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 for all vertices that are reachable from the initial `ver` and 0 for all other vertices.
Code of the loop:
for node in graph[ver]:
    if not vis[node]:
        q.append(node)
        vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ver` is the vertex that was at the front of `q`, `q` has one less element initially. If `not vis[node]`, then `q` has one more element which is `node`, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 for all vertices that are reachable from the initial `ver` including `node`, and `vis[node]` is 1. Otherwise, `q` has one less element and `vis` remains unchanged. `graph[ver]` must contain at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ver` is the vertex that was at the front of `q`. If `not vis[node]`, then `q` has one more element which is `node`, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 for all vertices that are reachable from the initial `ver` including `node`, and `vis[node]` is 1. Otherwise, `q` has one less element and `vis` remains unchanged. `graph[ver]` must contain at least one more element, and `node` is the next element in `graph[ver]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ver` is the vertex that was at the front of `q`, `node` is the next element in `graph[ver]`, `q` includes `node` if it was not already visited, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 for all vertices that are reachable from the initial `ver` including `node`, and `vis[node]` is 1 if `node` was not already visited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
