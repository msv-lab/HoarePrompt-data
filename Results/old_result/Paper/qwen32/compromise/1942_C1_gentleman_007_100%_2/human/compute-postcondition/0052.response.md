The code sets `vis[node]` to 1. This means that the vertex `node` is now marked as visited. All other parts of the initial state remain unchanged. Specifically, `ver` is still the vertex that was at the front of `q`, `node` is still the next element in `graph[ver]`, `q` still includes `node` if `not vis[node]` (though this condition is now false since `vis[node]` is set to 1), and `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 for all vertices that are reachable from the initial `ver` including `node`.

Output State: **`ver` is the vertex that was at the front of `q`, `node` is the next element in `graph[ver]`, `q` includes `node` if it was not already visited, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 for all vertices that are reachable from the initial `ver` including `node`, and `vis[node]` is 1.**
