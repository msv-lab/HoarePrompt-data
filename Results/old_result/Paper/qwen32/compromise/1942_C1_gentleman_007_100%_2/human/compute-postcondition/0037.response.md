To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the state.

The loop iterates over all neighbors of the current vertex `ver` from the graph. For each neighbor `node` that has not been visited (`vis[node] == 0`), it appends `node` to the deque `q` and marks it as visited (`vis[node] = 1`).

The loop will continue to execute until all reachable vertices from the initial `ver` have been visited and added to `q` (if they were not already there).

**Final Output State:**
- `ver` will be the last vertex that was processed. However, `ver` is not directly part of the final output state since it changes with each iteration and is not retained after the loop.
- `q` will contain all vertices that are reachable from the initial `ver` in the order they were discovered (BFS order), starting from the initial `ver` and including all its neighbors, their neighbors, and so on, but with the initial `ver` removed from the front.
- `vis` will be a list where `vis[i]` is 1 for all vertices that are reachable from the initial `ver` and 0 for all other vertices.

Given the above, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`q` contains all reachable vertices in BFS order starting from the initial `ver` (excluding the initial `ver` itself), and `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 for all reachable vertices and 0 for all other vertices.**

In simpler terms, `q` will have all the vertices that were explored during the BFS traversal, and `vis` will indicate which vertices were visited.
