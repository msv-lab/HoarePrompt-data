Postcondition: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary (or list of lists) where `graph[ver]` must contain at least one adjacent vertex, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, `q` is a deque, and `vis[ver]` is 1. If `vis[node]` was originally 0, then `q` contains `node` and `vis[node]` is updated to 1. Otherwise, `q` remains empty and `vis[node]` remains unchanged.**
