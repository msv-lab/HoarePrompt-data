Output State: **`i` must be greater than 0 and `j` must be greater than 0; `j` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `j` is decreased by 1, while `i` remains unchanged and continues to be greater than 0. The condition that `j` must be greater than 0 still holds true after the decrement, assuming `j` was at least 2 before the operation.
