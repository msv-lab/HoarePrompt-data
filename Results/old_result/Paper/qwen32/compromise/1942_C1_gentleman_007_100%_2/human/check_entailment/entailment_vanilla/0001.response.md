To determine the correctness of the provided Python program for the given problem, we need to analyze whether the program correctly computes the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out based on the vertices she has chosen and the constraints of the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective:** Maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
- **Constraints:** 
  - The cake is a regular polygon with `n` sides.
  - Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices.
  - We can choose no more than `y` additional vertices (in this version, `y=0`).
- **Approach:** 
  - The problem can be solved by finding the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices without any intersections. 
  - Since `y=0`, we can only use the `x` vertices provided by Bessie.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Triangular Pieces:** Each triangle is formed by three vertices. 
2. **Non-Intersecting Condition:** Two diagonals are non-intersecting if they do not share any interior points.
3. **Graph Representation:** The problem can be viewed as finding the maximum number of non-intersecting edges in a graph formed by the chosen vertices.

### Analysis of the Provided Code:
The provided code includes several utility functions, but none of them directly address the problem of finding the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake. The code seems to include generic functions for graph operations, number theory, and other utilities, but does not implement the specific logic required for this problem.

### Correct Implementation Approach:
To solve the problem:
1. **Sort the Chosen Vertices:** Sort the vertices chosen by Bessie in clockwise order.
2. **Count Triangles:** Use a greedy or dynamic programming approach to count the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed from the sorted list of vertices.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem as described. It lacks a specific algorithm to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem.

**Correctness: False**
