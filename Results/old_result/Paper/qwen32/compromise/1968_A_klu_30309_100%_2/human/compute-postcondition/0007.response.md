Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 1 element, `results` is an empty list, `max_sum` is less than `current_sum`, `best_y` is 1, `x` is at least 2, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y` and `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`.**
