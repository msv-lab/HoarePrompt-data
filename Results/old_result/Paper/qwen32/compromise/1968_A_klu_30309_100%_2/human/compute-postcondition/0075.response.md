The code snippet provided updates the value of `current_sum` by adding `gcd_val` and `y`. The values of `gcd_val`, `y`, and `current_sum` are affected, but the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases` with an additional `1` appended, `best_y` is `x - 2` if `current_sum` was greater than `max_sum`, otherwise `best_y` remains 1, `x` is the next element in `test_cases` and must be at least 2, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` if `current_sum` was greater than `max_sum`, `y` is `y + 1`**.

In simpler terms, the value of `current_sum` is now the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`. The other variables retain their previous values or conditions.
