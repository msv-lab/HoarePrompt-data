To determine the output state, we'll analyze the given code snippet and how it affects the variables.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements
- `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`
- `max_sum` is 0
- `best_y` is 1
- `x` is the next element in `test_cases`
- `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`

The code snippet:
```python
current_sum = gcd_val + y
```

The variable `current_sum` is being assigned the value of `gcd_val + y`. However, the variable `y` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming `y` is a variable that has been defined previously in the code (not provided here), its value will be used in the calculation of `current_sum`.

Since `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, and `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, the value of `gcd_val` will be determined by the values of `x` and `y`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `current_sum`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`**.
