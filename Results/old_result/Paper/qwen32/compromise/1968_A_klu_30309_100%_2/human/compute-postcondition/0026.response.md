To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop operates and how the variables evolve with each iteration.

Given:
- The loop iterates over `y` starting from `x-1` down to `1`.
- For each `y`, it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`, and then calculates `current_sum` as `gcd_val + y`.
- If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to `y`, then the loop breaks.
- If `current_sum` is not greater than `max_sum`, the loop continues with the next `y`.

The loop stops as soon as it finds the first `y` that maximizes `current_sum`. Since the loop iterates from `x-1` down to `1`, the first `y` that maximizes `current_sum` will be the one that gives the highest `gcd_val + y` for that `x`.

The output state after all iterations of the loop for a single `x` will be:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `test_cases` remains unchanged.
- `results` remains unchanged (it is not modified in the loop).
- `max_sum` will be the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` found for that `x`.
- `best_y` will be the `y` that gave the maximum `current_sum` for that `x`.

Since the loop processes each `x` in `test_cases` independently, the final state will be the result of processing all `x` in `test_cases`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 1 element, `results` is an empty list, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` found for the last `x` in `test_cases`, `best_y` is the `y` that gave the maximum `current_sum` for the last `x` in `test_cases`.**

In simpler terms: The output state will have the maximum `gcd_val + y` and the corresponding `y` for the last `x` processed in `test_cases`. All other variables remain unchanged.
