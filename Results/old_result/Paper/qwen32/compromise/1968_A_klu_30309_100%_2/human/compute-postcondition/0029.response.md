Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is the `y` that gave the maximum `current_sum` for the last `x` in `test_cases`, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`**

Explanation: The value of `max_sum` is set to 0. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
