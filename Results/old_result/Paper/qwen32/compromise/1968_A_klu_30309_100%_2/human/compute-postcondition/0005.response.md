The code provided calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using the `math.gcd` function and assigns it to the variable `gcd_val`. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `max_sum`, and `best_y` remain unchanged. The value of `x` is at least 2, and `y` is not specified in the initial state, but it is implied to be used in the `gcd` calculation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` must have at least 1 element, `results` is an empty list, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` is at least 2, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.**
