To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables evolve through each iteration.

### Loop Explanation:
- **Loop Head**: `for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1)`
  - `y` starts from `x - 1` and decrements by 1 in each iteration until `y` becomes 1.
- **Loop Body**:
  - `gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)`: Computes the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.
  - `current_sum = gcd_val + y`: Calculates the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`.
  - If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to `y`, then the loop breaks.

### Output State Evolution:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `max_sum` is initialized to 0.
   - `best_y` is initialized to 1.
   - `results` is a list that will store the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases`.

2. **Loop Iterations**:
   - For each `x` in `test_cases`, the loop iterates from `x - 1` down to 1, calculating `gcd_val` and `current_sum`.
   - The loop breaks as soon as it finds a `y` that maximizes `current_sum`.
   - The `best_y` for that `x` is stored in `results`.

3. **After All Iterations**:
   - The loop processes each `x` in `test_cases` one by one.
   - For each `x`, it finds the `y` that maximizes `gcd_val + y` and stores this `y` in `results`.
   - `t`, `test_cases`, and the structure of `results` remain unchanged throughout the loop.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains the same.
- `test_cases` remains the same.
- `results` contains the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases`.
- `max_sum` and `best_y` are reset to their initial values (0 and 1, respectively) before processing the next `x`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases`, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`.**

In simple terms, after processing all test cases, `results` will contain the best `y` values that maximize `gcd_val + y` for each `x` in `test_cases`. The other variables `t`, `test_cases`, `max_sum`, and `best_y` will be in their initial states, ready for the next potential use.
