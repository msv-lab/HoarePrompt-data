Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a logical error in the inner loop where it breaks after finding the first `y` that maximizes the sum of `gcd(x, y) + y`. This means it does not check other possible values of `y` that might also yield the maximum sum. Instead, it should continue checking all possible values of `y` to ensure the maximum sum is found. 

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
            # Do not break here; continue to check other values of y
        results.append(best_y)
    return results
```

The `break` statement should be removed to ensure that all possible values of `y` are considered.
