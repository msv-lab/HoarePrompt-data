The given code snippet only initializes a constant variable `M` with the value `10 ** 9 + 7`. No other variables are modified, and no operations are performed that would affect the initial state of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, or the lists of `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the addition of the new variable `M`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5. Each of the `m` lines contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` where `a_i` ≠ `b_i`, 1 ≤ `a_i`, `b_i` ≤ `n`, and 1 ≤ `f_i` ≤ 10^9. All pairs (`a_i`, `b_i`) are distinct. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The sum of `k` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `M` is 10 ** 9 + 7.**
