The code snippet `sum_f += f` increments the value of `sum_f` by the value of `f`. Given the initial state, the value of `sum_f` was 0, and now it will be equal to the value of `f`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is `f`, `j` is 0, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `f` is the third integer from the input.**
