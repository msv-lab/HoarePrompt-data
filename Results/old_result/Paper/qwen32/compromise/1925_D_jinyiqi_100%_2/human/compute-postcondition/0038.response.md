The given code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `p` and `q` using the `math.gcd` function and assigns the result to the variable `gcd`. 

Given the initial state, the values of `p` and `q` are already defined as:
- `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`
- `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)`

After executing the line `gcd = math.gcd(p, q)`, the variable `gcd` will hold the GCD of `p` and `q`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `k` is the third integer from the new input, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read in the `m` iterations, `j` is `2m - 1`, `a`, `b`, `f` are the values from the last iteration, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
