The code snippet provided increments the variable `sum_f` by adding the current value of `f` to it. Given the initial state, `sum_f` was initially set to `2 * f`. After executing the line `sum_f += f`, the new value of `sum_f` becomes `2 * f + f`, which simplifies to `3 * f`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is 3 * `f`, `j` is 2, `a` is the first integer from the new input, `b` is the second integer from the new input, `f` is the third integer from the new input.**
