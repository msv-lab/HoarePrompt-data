To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to consider how the loop modifies the variables based on the provided information.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs `m` times, where `m` is an input integer.
- In each iteration, three integers `a`, `b`, and `f` are read from the input.
- The variable `sum_f` accumulates the value of `f` across all iterations.
- Variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` are not modified within the loop and thus retain their initial values.

### Final Output State:
- After `m` iterations, `sum_f` will be the sum of all `f` values read during the loop.
- The loop variable `j` will be `m - 1` after the last iteration since it starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
- The variables `a`, `b`, and `f` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop.

### Output State:
- `t`: Remains the same as the initial input integer.
- `i`: Remains 0 as it is not modified in the loop.
- `n`: Remains the same as the initial input integer.
- `m`: Remains the same as the initial input integer (though it determines the number of iterations).
- `k`: Remains the same as the initial input integer.
- `sum_f`: Is the sum of all `f` values read during the `m` iterations.
- `j`: Is `m - 1` after the loop completes.
- `a`, `b`, `f`: Hold the values from the last iteration of the loop.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read during the `m` iterations, `j` is `m - 1`, `a` is the first integer from the last input, `b` is the second integer from the last input, `f` is the third integer from the last input.**
