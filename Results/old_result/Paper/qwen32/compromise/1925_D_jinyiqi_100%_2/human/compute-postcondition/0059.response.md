The code snippet provided divides `p` by its greatest common divisor (`gcd`) with `q`. This operation simplifies the fraction represented by `p` and `q` to its lowest terms.

Given the initial state, the value of `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`. After executing `p = p // gcd`, the value of `p` will be reduced to its simplified form.

The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `k` is the third integer from the new input, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read during the loop, `j` is `m-1`, `a`, `b`, `f` are the values from the last iteration, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
