The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is 0, `j` is 0, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `f` is the third integer from the input.**
