To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables. The loop iterates `m` times, and in each iteration, it reads three integers (`a`, `b`, `f`) from the input, adds `f` to `sum_f`, and updates `j`. 

Here's the detailed breakdown:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t`: Input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4 (unchanged).
  - `i`: 1 (unchanged).
  - `n`: First integer from the new input (unchanged).
  - `m`: Second integer from the new input (loop runs `m` times).
  - `k`: Third integer from the new input (unchanged).
  - `sum_f`: 0 (initially, then accumulates the sum of `f` values).
  - `j`: `m - 1` (initially, then increments by 1 in each iteration).
  - `a`, `b`, `f`: Updated in each iteration with new input values.
  - `cn2`: `n * (n - 1) // 2` (unchanged).
  - `p` and `q`: Calculated based on `sum_f`, `m`, `k`, and `cn2`.
  - `gcd`: Greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.

- **Loop Execution:**
  - The loop runs `m` times, and in each iteration:
    - Reads three integers `a`, `b`, `f` from the input.
    - Updates `sum_f` by adding `f`.
    - Increments `j` by 1.

After `m` iterations:
- `j` will be `m - 1 + m = 2m - 1`.
- `sum_f` will be the sum of all `f` values read in the `m` iterations.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, `gcd`) will be updated based on the final value of `sum_f`.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `k` is the third integer from the new input, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read in the `m` iterations, `j` is `2m - 1`, `a`, `b`, `f` are the values from the last iteration, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
