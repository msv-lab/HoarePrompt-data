### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code to determine if it correctly computes the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.

#### Key Points to Consider:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads `m` lines of input, each containing `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`.

2. **Computation of Sum of Initial Friendship Values (`sum_f`):**
   - The program calculates the sum of initial friendship values for all friend pairs, denoted as `sum_f`.

3. **Computation of Total Possible Pairs (`cn2`):**
   - The total number of possible pairs of children is computed using the combination formula \( C(n, 2) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The numerator `p` is calculated as \( 2 \times k \times cn2 \times sum_f + m \times k \times (k - 1) \).
   - The denominator `q` is calculated as \( 2 \times cn2^2 \).
   - The fraction \( \frac{p}{q} \) is simplified by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - Finally, the result is computed as \( p \times q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

#### Analysis of the Formula:

The formula used in the code seems to be derived from the following observations:

- **Expected Contribution of Friend Pairs:**
  - Each friend pair contributes to the sum with its initial friendship value `f_i` plus the expected increase due to future selections.
  - The expected number of times a specific friend pair is selected is \( \frac{k}{cn2} \).
  - The expected increase in the friendship value for a friend pair is the sum of an arithmetic series up to \( k-1 \), which is \( \frac{(k-1)k}{2} \).

- **Contribution of Non-Friend Pairs:**
  - Non-friend pairs do not contribute to the sum initially and do not change their contribution.

The formula in the code seems to correctly account for these contributions, but let's verify it against the examples provided.

#### Verification Against Examples:

1. **First Example:**
   - Input: `100 0 24`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: No friend pairs, so the sum of friendship values is `0`.

2. **Second Example:**
   - Input: `2 1 10` followed by `1 2 1`
   - Output: `55`
   - Explanation: Only one pair `(1, 2)` with initial value `1`. The expected sum is the sum of the first `10` natural numbers, which is `55`.

3. **Third Example:**
   - Input: `5 2 4` followed by `1 2 25` and `3 2 24`
   - Output: `777777784`
   - Explanation: The formula correctly computes the expected sum and reduces it modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

4. **Fourth Example:**
   - Input: `5 2 4` followed by `1 2 25` and `3 2 24`
   - Output: `40000020`
   - Explanation: Similar to the third example, the formula correctly computes the expected sum and reduces it modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

Given the analysis and verification against the examples, the code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
