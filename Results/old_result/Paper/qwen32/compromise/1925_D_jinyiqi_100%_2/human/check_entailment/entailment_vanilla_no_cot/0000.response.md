Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. There are several issues with the logic used in the program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**: The formula used in the program to calculate `p` and `q` is incorrect. The expected value calculation should consider the probability of selecting each pair of friends and how their friendship values change over the excursions.

2. **Handling of Non-Friend Pairs**: The program does not correctly account for non-friend pairs. The expected value should consider both friend and non-friend pairs.

3. **Friendship Value Update**: The program incorrectly assumes that the friendship value increases linearly with each selection of a friend pair. However, the problem requires considering the probability of selecting each pair and the cumulative effect of the increased friendship values over the excursions.

Here's a brief outline of how the problem should be approached:

- For each friend pair, calculate the expected number of times it will be selected over `k` excursions.
- For each non-friend pair, the expected contribution is zero.
- Use the probabilities to compute the expected sum of friendship values.

The correct approach involves using combinatorial mathematics to determine the expected number of times each friend pair is selected and then calculating the expected sum of friendship values accordingly. The provided program does not implement this logic correctly.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is False.
