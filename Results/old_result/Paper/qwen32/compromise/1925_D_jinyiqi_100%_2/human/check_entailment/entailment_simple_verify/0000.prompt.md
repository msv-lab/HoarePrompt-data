You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

The final output for each iteration is `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)`, which is printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:

The problem requires us to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for excursions. This expected value needs to be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers, and we need to calculate \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

### Key Points:
1. **Total Possible Pairs**: For \(n\) children, the total number of possible pairs is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
2. **Friendship Values**: Each pair of friends starts with a certain friendship value and increases by 1 each time they are chosen.
3. **Expected Value Calculation**: We need to calculate the expected sum of friendship values over \(k\) excursions.

### Program Analysis:

The provided program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the number of children \(n\), the number of pairs of friends \(m\), and the number of excursions \(k\). It then reads the details of each pair of friends and their initial friendship values.

The core part of the program calculates:
- `sum_f`: The sum of initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.
- `cn2`: The total number of possible pairs of children.
- `p` and `q`: The numerator and denominator of the fraction representing the expected value.
- Finally, it computes \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

### Issues in the Program:

Upon reviewing the program, there are several issues:

1. **Incorrect Formula for `p` and `q`**:
   - The formula used for `p` and `q` seems incorrect. The current implementation does not accurately reflect the expected value calculation as described in the problem statement.
   
2. **Handling of Non-Friend Pairs**:
   - The program does not correctly account for the contribution of non-friend pairs to the expected value.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where there are no pairs of friends (\(m = 0\)) correctly.
   - It also does not handle cases where \(k\) is very large relative to \(n\) and \(m\).

### Conclusion:

Given these issues, the program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all test cases as described in the problem statement.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program fails to correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values due to incorrect formulas and lack of proper handling of edge cases. Specifically, the formula for `p` and `q` is incorrect, and the program does not account for the contribution of non-friend pairs properly.
