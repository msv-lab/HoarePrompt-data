Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
- **Introverts (a)**: Each introvert must have a tent alone.
- **Extroverts (b)**: Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others.
- **Universals (c)**: Universals can be in a tent alone, with one other person, or with two others.
- **Objective**: Determine the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. Output -1 if it's impossible.

### Provided Program
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        k = 0
        if (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            k += a + (b + c) // 3
            if (b + c) % 3 != 0:
                k += 1
            print(k)
```

### Analysis
1. **Introverts**:
   - Each introvert needs their own tent, so `a` tents are required for introverts.

2. **Extroverts**:
   - Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two others.
   - If `b` is not a multiple of 3, and there aren't enough universals to pair up the remaining extroverts, it should be impossible.

3. **Universals**:
   - Universals can be used to complete tents with extroverts if needed.

### Checking the Logic
- **Condition to Output -1**:
  - If `b % 3 != 0` (meaning extroverts can't perfectly fill tents of 3), and `c < 3` (not enough universals to fill the remaining spots), and `(b + c) % 3 != 0` (indicating that even with universals, we can't perfectly fill tents of 3), then it's impossible.
  - However, the condition `(b + c) % 3 != 0` in the code is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. For example, if `b` is 2 and `c` is 1, then `b % 3 != 0` and `c < 3` are true, but `(b + c) % 3 == 0` (3 % 3 == 0), so the program would incorrectly return -1. Instead, we should just check if `b % 3 != 0` and `c < b % 3`.

- **Calculating the Number of Tents**:
  - `k += a` accounts for the tents needed for introverts.
  - `k += (b + c) // 3` accounts for the tents that can be filled with extroverts and universals.
  - If `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, it means there are leftover extroverts/universals that need an additional tent.

### Counterexample
Consider the case:
```
1
2 1 1
```
- `a = 2`, `b = 1`, `c = 1`
- `b % 3 != 0` (True)
- `c < 3` (True)
- `(b + c) % 3 != 0` (False, because 2 % 3 == 2)
- The program would output `-1` because of the incorrect condition, but it should output `3`:
  - 2 tents for introverts.
  - 1 tent for the extrovert and the universal.

### Conclusion
The provided program is incorrect because it uses an incorrect condition to determine if it's impossible to accommodate the participants.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**.
