You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        print(l)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three strings of equal length, and determines for each test case whether there exists at least one position where the characters in the first two strings differ from the character in the third string. If such a position exists for all characters in the strings, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Logic Error in Matching Template**:
   - The program iterates through each character of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` and checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If this condition holds for any character, it sets `l` to 'YES'. However, this does not ensure that there exists a template such that `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not match.
   - The program should ensure that for each position `i`, either `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and different from the lowercase version of the template character, or `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different and the template character is the uppercase version of `a[i]` or `b[i]`. Also, `c[i]` should not match the template.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Template Conditions**:
   - The program does not construct a template and check the conditions properly. It only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, which is not sufficient to determine if a valid template exists.
   - For example, consider the case where `a = "abc"`, `b = "abc"`, and `c = "abd"`. The program would incorrectly output "YES" because for each character, `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and different from `c[i]`. However, there is no template that can make `a` and `b` match while `c` does not match.

3. **Output for Each Test Case**:
   - The variable `l` is set to 'YES' initially and only set to 'NO' in the `else` block of the inner loop. This means that if the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` holds for any character, the program will output 'YES' for that test case, regardless of whether a valid template exists for the entire string.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Input:
```
1
3
abc
abc
abd
```
Expected Output:
```
NO
```
Actual Output:
```
YES
```

This example demonstrates that the program does not correctly determine the existence of a valid template for the given strings. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
