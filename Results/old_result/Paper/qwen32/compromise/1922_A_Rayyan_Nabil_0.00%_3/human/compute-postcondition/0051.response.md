To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the logic of the loop and how it affects the variable `l`.

The loop iterates over the range `n` times, and for each iteration, it checks if `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. If this condition is met for any index `i`, the variable `l` is set to `'YES'`. If the loop completes without finding any such index, `l` remains `'NO'`.

Given the initial state, `l` is already set to `'YES'` if there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`. If no such index exists, `l` is `'NO'`.

The loop does not change `l` from `'YES'` once it has been set to `'YES'`. Therefore, if `l` is `'YES'` after the first few iterations, it will remain `'YES'` after all iterations. If `l` is `'NO'` after the first few iterations, it will remain `'NO'` unless the condition `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]` is met in one of the remaining iterations.

Since the loop iterates `n` times, and `l` is only set to `'YES'` if the condition is met at any point during these iterations, the final output state of `l` will be `'YES'` if the condition is met at least once during the `n` iterations, otherwise it will be `'NO'`.

Thus, the final output state depends on whether the condition `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]` is met at any index `i` from `0` to `n-1`. If it is met at least once, `l` will be `'YES'`; otherwise, it will be `'NO'`.

Given the initial state and the loop logic, the final output state is:

Output State: **'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`, otherwise 'NO'.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is `'YES'` if the condition `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]` is true for any index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, otherwise it is `'NO'`.
