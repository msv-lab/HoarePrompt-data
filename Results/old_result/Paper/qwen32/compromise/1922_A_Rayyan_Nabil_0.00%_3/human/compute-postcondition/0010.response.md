Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is an input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is an input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is an input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. At the current index `i`, if `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then `l` remains 'YES'. Otherwise, `l` remains unchanged.**
