The code snippet `c = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `c`. The other variables `l`, `i`, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index i such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], otherwise l is 'NO'; `i` is `i + 1`; `t` remains the same; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the string entered by the user; `b` is the string entered by the user; `c` is the string entered by the user.**
