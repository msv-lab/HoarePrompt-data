Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is an input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is an input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is an input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is `i + 1`, `l` is 'YES'**.

In natural language: The value of `l` has been set to 'YES'. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state, with the exception that `i` has been incremented by 1.
