To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to understand the logic of the loop and how the variable `l` is updated.

The loop iterates `n` times, and in each iteration, it checks whether `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. If this condition is met for any `i`, `l` is set to 'YES'. If the loop completes without this condition being met, `l` is set to 'NO'.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can deduce that:

- After the first iteration (`i = 0`), `l` is 'YES' if `a[0] != c[0]` and `b[0] != c[0]`.
- After the second iteration (`i = 1`), `l` is 'YES' if `a[1] != c[1]` and `b[1] != c[1]`, unless `l` was already 'YES' from the first iteration.
- After the third iteration (`i = 2`), `l` is 'YES' if `a[2] != c[2]` and `b[2] != c[2]`, unless `l` was already 'YES' from the first or second iteration.

Following this logic, after all `n` iterations, `l` will be 'YES' if there is at least one index `i` (where `0 <= i < n`) such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`. If no such index exists, `l` will be 'NO'.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`, otherwise `l` is 'NO'.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `l` will be 'YES' if any character in `a` and `b` at the same position differs from the corresponding character in `c`. Otherwise, `l` will be 'NO'.
