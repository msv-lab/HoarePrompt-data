Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `n` and `m` such that 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 100.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to the value of the integer input by the user, which is constrained to be between 1 and 100, inclusive. The conditions for the test cases (each having two integers `n` and `m` between 1 and 100) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the current line of code.
