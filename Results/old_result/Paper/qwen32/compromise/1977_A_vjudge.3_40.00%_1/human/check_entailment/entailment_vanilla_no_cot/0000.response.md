Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Here's why:

1. **Base Cases:**
   - If `n == m`, then it's possible to achieve `m` cubes by adding one cube `m` times. This is correctly handled by the program.
   - If `m > n`, it's impossible to have more cubes than moves, as each move can only add or remove one cube. This is also correctly handled by the program.

2. **Incorrect Logic:**
   - The program then checks if `m == n - 1` and prints 'Yes'. This is incorrect because it only considers the scenario where the number of cubes is one less than the number of moves, which is not the only scenario where it's possible to have `m` cubes. For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 1`, it's possible by adding a cube 3 times and removing it once, but the program will print 'No'.
   - The subsequent checks for even and odd `m` and `n` are also incorrect. The parity (even or odd nature) of `m` and `n` does not directly determine whether it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves. The key is whether the difference `n - m` is non-negative and even, as each pair of moves (one addition and one removal) effectively cancels out, and any remaining moves must be additions if `m > 0`.

**Correct Approach:**
- The correct logic should be: It is possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves if and only if `n - m` is non-negative and even. This is because each pair of moves (one addition and one removal) cancels out, and any remaining moves must be additions.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

This program correctly checks if `n - m` is non-negative and even, which ensures that it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
