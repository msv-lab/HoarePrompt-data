### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube from the tower. Let's analyze the conditions in the provided program:

1. **If `n == m`:** This condition checks if the number of moves `n` is exactly equal to the number of cubes `m`. If true, it's possible to add one cube at a time for `n` moves to end up with `m` cubes. This condition is correct.

2. **If `m > n`:** This condition checks if the number of cubes `m` is greater than the number of moves `n`. Since each move can add or remove only one cube, it's impossible to end up with more cubes than the number of moves. This condition is correct.

3. **If `m == n - 1`:** This condition checks if the number of cubes `m` is exactly one less than the number of moves `n`. If true, it's possible to add one cube at a time for `n-1` moves and then remove one cube, ending up with `m` cubes. This condition is correct.

4. **If `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0`:** This condition checks if both `m` and `n` are even. If true, it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves because both `m` and `n` being even means the difference between `n` and `m` is even, and we can make the necessary additions and subtractions to achieve the desired number of cubes. This condition is correct.

5. **If `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`:** This condition checks if both `m` and `n` are odd. Similar to the previous condition, if both `m` and `n` are odd, the difference between `n` and `m` is even, and we can make the necessary additions and subtractions to achieve the desired number of cubes. This condition is correct.

6. **Else:** If none of the above conditions are met, the program outputs 'No'. This is correct because if `m` and `n` have different parities (one is even and the other is odd), the difference between `n` and `m` is odd, and it's impossible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

The provided program correctly handles all possible scenarios and outputs the correct results based on the problem's requirements.

### Correctness: **True**
