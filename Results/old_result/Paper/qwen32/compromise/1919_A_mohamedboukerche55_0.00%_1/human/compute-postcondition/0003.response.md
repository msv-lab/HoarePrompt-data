The given task involves a Python code snippet with a `print` statement. The precondition describes the state of the program, including variables `t`, `a`, and `b`, and a condition about their sum. However, the `print` statement itself does not depend on these variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is mentioned as unchanged, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
   - `a` and `b` are integers from the last line of input, and their sum is even.
   - The condition about the sum of `a` and `b` being even is relevant to the problem context but does not affect the `print` statement.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement is `print('bob  ')`.
   - This statement directly prints the string `'bob  '`.

3. **Output Determination**:
   - Since the `print` statement contains a direct string, the output will be exactly that string, regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, or `t`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **bob  **
