The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'alice'`. The initial state describes some variables (`t`, `a`, `b`) and a condition about their sum, but none of these variables or conditions affect the output of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `a`, `b`, or `t`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `a` and `b` are integers and their sum is odd. However, this information is not used in the `print` statement.
2. The variable `t` is mentioned to be unchanged, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
3. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'alice'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the string `'alice'`.

Output: **alice**
