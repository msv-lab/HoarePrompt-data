Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; `q` is an input integer; `mn` is 100. The loop has executed `q` times, and for each iteration, it has printed either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the comparison of `a`, `b`, and `c`.**
