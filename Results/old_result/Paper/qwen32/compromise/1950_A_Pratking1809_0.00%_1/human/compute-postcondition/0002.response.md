The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `q`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `q`. If `q` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The state before the loop starts includes `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, and `mn`. However, only `q` and `i` can be adjusted for the loop to execute.

To ensure the loop executes, `q` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is the loop variable and is initialized to 0 before the loop starts, so we do not need to adjust it in the state description.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; `q` must be greater than 0; `mn` is 100.**
