Output State: **`c` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `cases` is greater than the new value of `c`, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer from the input decremented by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers from the input, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

In simple terms, the value of `total` has been updated by adding the value at index `v` from the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`. All other variables retain their previous states, except for `total`, which has been incremented.
