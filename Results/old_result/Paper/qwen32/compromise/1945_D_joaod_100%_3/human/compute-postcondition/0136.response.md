The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The value of `v` is `na_frente`, and `na_frente` is at least 0. Therefore, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`c` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `cases` is greater than the new value of `c`, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer from the input decremented by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers from the input, `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente]`.**
