Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `cases` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 1; `na_frente` and `pos_final` are integers as read from the input; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers as read from the input.**

Explanation: The variable `custo_pra_trocar_a` is now a list of integers, which were read from the input and split accordingly. The values of `t`, `cases`, `na_frente`, and `pos_final` remain unchanged.
