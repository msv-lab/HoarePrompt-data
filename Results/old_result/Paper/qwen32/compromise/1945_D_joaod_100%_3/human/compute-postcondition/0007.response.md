The code snippet initializes a variable `total` to 0. The other variables (`t`, `cases`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `cases` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 1; `na_frente` is an integer as read from the input minus 1; `pos_final` is an integer as read from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers as read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers as read from the input; `total` is 0.**
