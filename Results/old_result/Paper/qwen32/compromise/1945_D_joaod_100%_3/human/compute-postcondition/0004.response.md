The code snippet reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `custo_pra_passar_b`. The initial state of the other variables (`t`, `cases`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_trocar_a`) remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `cases` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 1; `na_frente` and `pos_final` are integers as read from the input; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers as read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers as read from the input.**
