Output State: **`c` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `cases` is greater than the new value of `c`, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer from the input decremented by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers from the input, `total` is `total` + `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is `sys.float_info.max`, `v` is greater than `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is not less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `total` has been updated to include the cost of passing through position `v` as specified by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
