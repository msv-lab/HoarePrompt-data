The code `pos_final -= 1` decrements the value of `pos_final` by 1. The other variables (`c`, `cases`, `na_frente`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`c` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `cases` must be greater than the new value of `c`, `na_frente` is `na_frente - 1`, `pos_final` is an integer from the input decremented by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers from the input.**
