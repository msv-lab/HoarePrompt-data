Postcondition: **`c` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `cases` is greater than the new value of `c`, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer from the input decremented by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers from the input, `v` is `na_frente - 1`. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, then `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Otherwise, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `best` is greater than the updated `total`, then `best` is updated to the updated `total`. Otherwise, `best` remains unchanged.**
