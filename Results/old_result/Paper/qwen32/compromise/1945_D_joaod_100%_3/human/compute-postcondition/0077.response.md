Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `cases` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 1, `na_frente` is an integer as read from the input minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer as read from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers as read from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers as read from the input, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` remains unchanged, `c` is `c + 1`, and `v` is `v - 1`.**

In simple terms, the value of `total` is increased by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The values of `best`, `c`, and `v` remain unchanged except for `v` which is decremented by 1 and `c` which is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
