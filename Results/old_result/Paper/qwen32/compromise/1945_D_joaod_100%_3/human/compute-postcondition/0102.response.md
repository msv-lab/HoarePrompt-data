Output State: **`c` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `cases` must be greater than the new value of `c`, `na_frente` is `na_frente - 1`, `pos_final` is an integer from the input decremented by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers from the input, `total` is 0, `best` is `sys.float_info.max`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `c` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value, `cases` is still greater than the new value of `c`, `na_frente` has been decremented by 1, `pos_final` has been decremented by 1 from its input value, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain as lists of integers from the input, `total` remains 0, and `best` is set to the maximum float value (`sys.float_info.max`).
