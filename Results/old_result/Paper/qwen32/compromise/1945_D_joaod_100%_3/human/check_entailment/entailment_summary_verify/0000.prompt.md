You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, and two lists `a` and `b` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost to reach a specified position `m` from the start, considering the costs defined in lists `a` and `b`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in line. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum cost is flawed. Here's why:

The program iterates from the end of the line towards the front and keeps track of the total cost and the best cost encountered so far. However, it does not correctly account for the cost of bribing multiple people and ensuring that Kirill ends up in one of the first `m` positions.

### Potential Issue:
The program does not consider the optimal sequence of bribes to minimize the total cost. It simply adds the cost of bribing the current person or passing through them without considering the overall impact on the final position of Kirill.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
5 4 3 2 1
```

In this case, the optimal strategy would be for Kirill to bribe the third person (cost 3) and then the first person (cost 1), resulting in a total cost of 4. However, the program might incorrectly calculate a higher cost because it does not consider the optimal sequence of bribes.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve using a priority queue or a dynamic programming approach to find the minimum cost to move Kirill to one of the first `m` positions. The program should consider all possible bribes and calculate the total cost for each sequence, ensuring that Kirill ends up in one of the first `m` positions with the minimum cost.

Since the provided program does not handle this correctly, the correctness is **False**.
