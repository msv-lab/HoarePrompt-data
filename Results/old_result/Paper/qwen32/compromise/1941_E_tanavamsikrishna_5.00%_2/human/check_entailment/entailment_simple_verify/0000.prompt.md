You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is
that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his
friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row
and the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the
corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the
river banks, so the depth for them is 0 .

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over
it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost
of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be
installed so that the following conditions are met:

  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; 
  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; 
  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . 

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k
bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \le i
\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,
\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing
supports.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , m , k , and d (1
\le k \le n \le 100 , 3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le d \le m ) — the number
of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum
distance between supports.

Then follow n lines, i -th line contains m positive integers a_{i, j} (0 \le
a_{i, j} \le 10^6 , a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 ) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot m for all sets of input data does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of
supports installation.

Note

In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second
row.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/6b5282a065196a0a0ca650a68a351af816de8549.png)
It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells
are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river
bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second
and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells (2, 3) , (3, 2) , and on
the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum total cost of installing supports for the bridges. Let's break down the issues:

### Issues in `func_1`:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the cost for a single row by adding 1 to each cell and then trying to find the minimum cost for placing supports with the constraint on distance `d`. However, it does not correctly handle the placement of supports with the required distance constraint. The logic for placing supports with distance `d` is flawed. The function does not ensure that the supports are placed such that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
   - Specifically, the logic `row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1` does not correctly account for the distance constraint. It simply adds the minimum of the previous `d` cells plus 1 to the current cell, which does not guarantee that the supports will be placed with the required distance.

### Issues in `func_2`:
2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation for Multiple Rows**:
   - The function `func_2` calculates the cost for each row independently using `func_1` and then sums the costs for `k` consecutive rows to find the minimum total cost. However, since `func_1` does not correctly calculate the cost for a single row, the total cost for `k` consecutive rows will also be incorrect.
   - The function does not consider the interaction between the rows when calculating the total cost. For example, placing supports in a certain way in one row might affect the optimal placement of supports in the next row.

### Example to Demonstrate the Issue:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3 5 2 2
0 1 2 1 0
0 2 3 2 0
0 1 2 1 0
```
The correct output should be `8` because the optimal placement of supports would be:
- Row 1: Supports at positions 1, 3, 5 (cost = 0 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 4)
- Row 2: Supports at positions 1, 3, 5 (cost = 0 + 3 + 0 + 2 = 5)
- Row 3: Supports at positions 1, 3, 5 (cost = 0 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 4)

The total cost for rows 1 and 2 would be `4 + 4 = 8`.

However, the provided program will not produce this result because `func_1` does not correctly calculate the cost for a single row with the required constraints.

### Conclusion:
Since the provided program does not correctly handle the placement of supports with the required distance constraint and does not correctly calculate the total cost for `k` consecutive rows, it is incorrect.
