The function reads input parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, and a 2D list `rows`. It calculates the minimum cost of placing `k` consecutive bridges in each row of the grid, where the cost is determined by the values in `rows` and the maximum distance `d` between supports. The function outputs the minimum total cost among all rows.
