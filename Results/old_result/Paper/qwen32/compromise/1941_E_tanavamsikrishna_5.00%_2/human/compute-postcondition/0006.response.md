To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's break down the given code and understand what it does.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are given initial values.
   - `rows` is a 2D list where each row has `m` integers, with the first and last integers in each row being 0.
   - `costs` is a list where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`.
   - `total_costs` is initially an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(costs) - (k - 1)`.
   - In each iteration, it calculates the sum of `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list starting from index `i` and appends this sum to `total_costs`.

3. **Output State:**
   - The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and `rows` remain unchanged.
   - `costs` remains unchanged.
   - `total_costs` will contain the sums of `k` consecutive elements from `costs`.

Given this understanding, the output state after the loop executes is:

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `d` are unchanged; `rows` is unchanged; `costs` is unchanged; `total_costs` contains the sums of `k` consecutive elements from `costs`.**
