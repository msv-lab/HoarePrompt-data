The code snippet provided updates the `rows` variable by reading `n` lines of input, where each line contains `m` integers separated by spaces. The integers are converted to a list of lists (`rows`), with each sublist representing a row in the grid.

Given the initial state, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are already defined and `rows` is a 2D list of integers as described. The code modifies `rows` based on the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are updated to the values provided in the input; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid and contains `m` integers, with the first and last integers in each sublist being 0.**

In natural language, this means that the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain the same as they were in the initial state, but `rows` is now a 2D list constructed from the input, where each sublist (representing a row) contains `m` integers, and the first and last integers in each sublist are 0.
