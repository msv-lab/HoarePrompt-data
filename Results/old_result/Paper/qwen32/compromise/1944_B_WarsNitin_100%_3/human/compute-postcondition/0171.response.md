The code snippet contains only a `break` statement, which means it will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in. However, it does not affect the values of any variables directly.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `i + 2`
- `n` remains the same

Since the `break` statement does not modify any variables, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` remains the same and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
