The code snippet appends the element at index `i` of the list `c` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 4, the element at index 4 of `c` is added to `ans2`.

Since no other variables are modified by this line of code, the values of `t`, `q`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans1`, `req`, `l`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is the list of integers read from the input, `b` is the sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is the sorted list of integers from `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a`, `ans1` contains repeated elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not the first or last element if they are not equal to their adjacent elements, and `k` is either 0 or -2. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `ans2` contains two equal elements `c[i]` and `k` is -2. Otherwise, `ans2` remains unchanged and `k` remains 0, `i` is 4, `ans2` now includes `c[4]`.**
