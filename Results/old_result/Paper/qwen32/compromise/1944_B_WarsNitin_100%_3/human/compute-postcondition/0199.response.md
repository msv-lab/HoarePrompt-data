To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans2)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic described:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `q`: Always set to 1.
   - `n`: An integer greater than 2.
   - `a`: A list of integers read from the input.
   - `b`: The first `n` elements of `a`, sorted in ascending order.
   - `c`: The sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a`, sorted in ascending order.
   - `ans1`: Contains pairs of consecutive equal elements from `b` up to the point where `k` becomes 0, and additionally contains elements from `l` until `k` reaches 0 or `l` is exhausted.
   - `req`: Twice the second integer read from the input.
   - `i`: The last index processed before the loop breaks.
   - `ans2`: Contains pairs of consecutive equal elements from `c` up to the point where `k` becomes 0, and additionally contains elements from `l` until `k` reaches 0 or `l` is exhausted.
   - `l`: Contains elements from `b` that are not part of any pair of consecutive equal elements and are not equal to their next element.
   - `k`: 0 if the loop broke due to `k` reaching 0, otherwise it is the remaining value.

2. **Logic for `ans2`:**
   - `ans2` is populated with pairs of consecutive equal elements from `c` until `k` becomes 0.
   - If there are still elements left in `l` and `k` is not yet 0, elements from `l` are added to `ans2` until `k` reaches 0 or `l` is exhausted.

Given this setup, the `print(*ans2)` statement will print the contents of `ans2`. Since the exact contents of `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans1`, `req`, `i`, `l`, and `k` are not provided, we can only describe the contents of `ans2` based on the logic described.

**Output Description:**
- `ans2` contains pairs of consecutive equal elements from the sorted sublist `c` (which starts from index `n` to the end of `a`).
- If `k` is not yet 0 after processing pairs from `c`, additional elements from `l` (elements from `b` that are not part of any pair of consecutive equal elements and are not equal to their next element) are added to `ans2` until `k` reaches 0 or `l` is exhausted.

Therefore, the output will be the elements of `ans2` as described above.

Output: **ans2 (where ans2 contains pairs of consecutive equal elements from the sorted sublist c and additional elements from l if k is not yet 0)**
