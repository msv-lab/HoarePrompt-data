The given code snippet appends the current element `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Since `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, the effect of this operation is that `ans2` will now contain one more occurrence of `c[i]`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `q` remains 2.
- `n` remains an integer greater than 2.
- `a` remains the newly read list of integers from the input.
- `b` remains the first `n` elements of the new `a` sorted in ascending order.
- `c` remains the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a`, sorted in ascending order.
- `ans1` remains containing all pairs of equal elements from `b` up to the point where `k` reaches 0.
- `req` remains twice the second integer read from the input.
- `i` remains 1.
- `ans2` now contains `c[1]` (which is equal to `c[0]`) and `c[i]` (which is also equal to `c[0]`).
- `k` remains either 0 or its original value.
- `l` remains containing the first element of `b` if it is unique, and all unique elements from `b` that are not part of any pair.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is the newly read list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of the new `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a`, sorted in ascending order, `ans1` contains all pairs of equal elements from `b` up to the point where `k` reaches 0, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, `i` is 1, `ans2` is a list containing `c[0]` and `c[1]` (both are equal), `k` is either 0 or its original value, and `l` contains the first element of `b` if it is unique, and all unique elements from `b` that are not part of any pair.**
