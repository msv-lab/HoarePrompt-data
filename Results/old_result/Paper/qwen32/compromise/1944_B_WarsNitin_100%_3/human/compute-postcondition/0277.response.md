Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is the newly read list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of the new `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a`, sorted in ascending order, `ans1` contains all pairs of equal elements from `b` up to the point where `k` reaches 0, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, `i` is `n-1` or the last index processed before `k` reached 0, `ans2` contains all pairs of consecutive equal elements found in `c` until `k` reaches 0, `k` is 0, `l` contains at least one unique element from `b` that is not part of any pair**
