Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is positive infinity; `b` is positive infinity; `c` is 0. If `b` is greater than `a`, the condition `a > b` is true, but since the else part is empty, no changes occur beyond the initial state.**
