In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` which is a common Python convention for a variable that we do not intend to use. The variable `t` is the only variable in the loop head that we can adjust to ensure the loop executes.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be at least 1.
3. The value of `t` is already provided as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), which means it is already within the range that allows the loop to execute.

Since `t` is already within the valid range and is the only variable in the loop head that we can adjust, no further adjustment is needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
