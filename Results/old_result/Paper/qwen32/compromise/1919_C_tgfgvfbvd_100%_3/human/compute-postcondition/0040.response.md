The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to whatever integer is provided by the input. The other variables (`t`, `l`, `a`, `b`, and `c`) are not affected by this input statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer provided by the input, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is the smallest value in `l`, `b` is the second smallest value in `l`, `c` is the count of elements in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`**.
