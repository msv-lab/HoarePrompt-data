The value of `a` is updated to be equal to `l[x]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Since `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b` before the assignment, `b` still holds its value of `float('inf')` and `c` remains 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the list of integers provided by the input, `a` is `l[x]`, `b` is `float('inf')`, and `c` is 0.**
