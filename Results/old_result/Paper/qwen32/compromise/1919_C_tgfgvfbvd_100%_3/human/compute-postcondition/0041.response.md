The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `l`. This means that `l` is now updated to the list of integers provided by the input, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are no longer valid as they were calculated based on the previous list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer provided by the input, `l` is the list of integers provided by the input, `a` is the smallest value in `l`, `b` is the second smallest value in `l`, `c` is the count of elements in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`**.
