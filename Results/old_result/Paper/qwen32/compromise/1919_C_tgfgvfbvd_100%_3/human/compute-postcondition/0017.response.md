Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]` and `a` remains positive infinity, `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `a` is updated to `l[x]`, `b` remains positive infinity, and `c` is updated to 1. Additionally, `l[x]` is greater than `a`.**
