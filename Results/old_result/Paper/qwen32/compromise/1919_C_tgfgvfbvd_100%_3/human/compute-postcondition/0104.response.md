Postcondition: **`l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is either `l[x-2]` or `l[x]` or `float('inf')`, `b` is either `l[x]` or `l[x-1]` or `float('inf')`, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2, and `n` is greater than 0. If `l[x] <= b`, then `a` becomes `l[x-2]` and `b` becomes `l[x]`. Otherwise, if `a` was greater than `b`, then the values of `a` and `b` are swapped. In both cases, `x` is `x + 1`.**
