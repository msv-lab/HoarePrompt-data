Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `x` is incremented by 1; `b` is assigned the value of `l[x]`. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` and `b` have their values swapped.**

In simpler terms, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10,000. `n` remains an input integer that is at least 1. `l` remains a list of integers from the input. `x` has been incremented by 1. `b` now holds the value of the element at index `x` in the list `l`. If `a` is greater than `b`, their values will be swapped.
