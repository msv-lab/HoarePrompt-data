Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the list of integers provided by the input, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, and `c` is 0. Since the condition `a > b` is never true (both `a` and `b` are `float('inf')`), the else part is not executed, and the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
