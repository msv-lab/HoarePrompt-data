Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is positive infinity; `b` is positive infinity; `c` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(n):
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    if l[x] <= a:
        a = l[x]
    elif l[x] <= b:
        b = l[x]
    else:
        a = l[x]
        c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` and `b` remains positive infinity, `c` remains 0. Otherwise, if `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]` and `a` remains positive infinity, `c` remains 0. If `l[x]` is greater than `a`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`, `b` remains positive infinity, and `c` is updated to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `x` is incremented by 1. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is set to `l[x]`. If `a` was greater than `b` after this update, `a` and `b` are swapped. Otherwise, if `l[x]` is greater than `a` and less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]`, `b` is set to the initial value of `a`, and `c` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `x` is incremented by 1. If `l[x]` was less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is `l[x-1]`. If `l[x]` was greater than `a`, then `b` is assigned the value of `l[x]` if it was less than or equal to `b`, or `a` is assigned the value of `l[x]` and `c` is incremented by 1 if `l[x]` was greater than `b`. If `a` is greater than `b` at any point, then `a` and `b` have their values swapped.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
