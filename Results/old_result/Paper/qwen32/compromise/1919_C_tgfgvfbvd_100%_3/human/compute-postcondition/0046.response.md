The code snippet swaps the values of `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` is `float('inf')` and `b` is also `float('inf')`, but it is mentioned that `a` is greater than `b`, which is not possible since both are `float('inf')`. However, for the sake of the exercise, we will proceed with the swap operation as described.

After the swap:
- `a` will hold the value that `b` originally held, which is `float('inf')`.
- `b` will hold the value that `a` originally held, which is `float('inf')`.

Since the values of `a` and `b` are both `float('inf')`, the condition `a` is greater than `b` will still not hold after the swap, but the values themselves remain unchanged in terms of being `float('inf')`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the list of integers provided by the input, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, `c` is 0.**
