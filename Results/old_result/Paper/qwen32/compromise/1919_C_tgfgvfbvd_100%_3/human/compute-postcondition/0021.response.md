Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `x` is `x + 1`. If `a` was greater than `b`, then `a` is now the initial value of `b` and `b` is now the initial value of `a`. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**
