The code snippet `temp = a[i:i + 3]` updates the `temp` variable to be a slice of the list `a` starting at index `i` and including up to the next 3 elements. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is an integer greater than 2.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers.
- `temp` is a sorted slice of `a` starting at index `i + 1` and including up to the next 3 elements.
- `max` is updated if the second element of `temp` is greater than `max`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

After executing `temp = a[i:i + 3]`:
- `temp` is now a slice of `a` starting at index `i` and including up to the next 3 elements.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `temp` is a slice of `a` starting at index `i` and including up to the next 3 elements; `max` is updated if the second element of `temp` is greater than `max`; `i` is incremented by 1.**
