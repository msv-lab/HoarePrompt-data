The provided code snippet is `n = int(input())`. This line of code reassigns the variable `n` to the integer value of the user input. The initial state specifies that `n` is already an integer greater than 2. However, this value is being replaced by the new input value.

The values of `t`, `a`, and `max` remain unchanged by this code snippet because they are not referenced or modified in the given code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `max` is the maximum value of the middle elements of all possible slices of 3 consecutive elements in the array `a`.**
