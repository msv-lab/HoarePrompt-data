The code snippet `temp = a[i:i + 3]` creates a slice of the list `a` starting from index `i` and ending at `i + 3` (not inclusive). Given that `i` is 0, `temp` will be the first three elements of the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input and must be at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `max` is 0, `i` is 0, `temp` is a list containing the first three elements of `a`**.
