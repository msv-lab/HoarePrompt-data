The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into components based on whitespace, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`.

Given the initial state, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the array `a`, and `a` consists of `n` integers. After executing the given code, `a` will be updated to contain the integers provided in the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the input integer representing the length of the array `a`; `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by the input.**
