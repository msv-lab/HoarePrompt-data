The code snippet `temp = a[i:i + 3]` slices the list `a` starting from index `i` (which is 0) and goes up to but does not include index `i + 3` (which is 3). This means `temp` will be assigned the first three elements of the list `a`.

Given that `n` is at least 3, the list `a` has at least three elements. Therefore, `temp` will be a list containing the first three elements of `a`.

The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `max` remain unchanged except for the introduction of the new variable `temp`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t-1`, `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input and must be at least 3, `a` is the new list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `i` is 0, `max` is 0, `temp` is the list containing the first three elements of `a`.**
