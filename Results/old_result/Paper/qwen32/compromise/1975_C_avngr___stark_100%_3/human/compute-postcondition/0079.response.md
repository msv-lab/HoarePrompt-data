Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it finds and prints the maximum value of the middle elements in all possible slices of 3 consecutive elements in the array `a`. If `n` is 2, it simply prints the minimum value of the two elements.**
