The code snippet sorts the list `temp`. Given that `temp` initially contains the elements `a[4]`, `a[5]`, and `a[6]`, sorting `temp` will arrange these three elements in ascending order. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `max`, and `i` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `temp` is a sorted list containing `a[4]`, `a[5]`, and `a[6]`; `max` is updated to the second element of `temp` if the second element of `temp` is greater than the original `max`; `i` is 4.**
