The code snippet `temp.sort()` sorts the list `temp` in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `temp` initially contains the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]`, after sorting, `temp` will be a list of these three elements arranged in ascending order.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input and must be at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `i` is 1, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]` in ascending order. If the second element of `temp` (before sorting) was greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to that value; otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.**
