Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t-1`, `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input and is at least 3, `a` is the new list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `i` is 2, and `temp` is the sorted sublist of `a` starting from index 2 and including the next two elements. If the second element of `temp` is greater than the original `max`, then `max` is updated to the second element of `temp`; otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.**
