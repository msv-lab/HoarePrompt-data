### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to ensure the correctness of the solution:

1. **Sorting**: The program sorts the array to correctly identify the median. This step is accurate and necessary.
2. **Median Calculation**: The median is determined by the element at index `n // 2` in the sorted array. This is correct for both odd and even lengths of the array, as the problem specifies that the median is the element at the position `ceil(n / 2)`, which is indeed `n // 2` in zero-based indexing.
3. **Heap Usage**: The program uses a min-heap to efficiently find and increment the smallest elements starting from the median index. This is a good approach to minimize the number of operations.
4. **Increment Logic**: The program continuously increments the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median. This ensures that the median is increased by at least 1 with the minimum number of operations.
5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles arrays of different lengths (odd and even) and arrays with duplicate elements correctly.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations:
- **State Before Function Call**: The annotations correctly state that `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`.
- **Inside `func_1`**:
  - **Sorting**: The array is sorted, which is correct.
  - **Median Calculation**: The median index is correctly calculated as `n // 2`, and the current median is `arr[median_index]`.
  - **Heap Initialization**: The heap is initialized with elements from the median index to the end of the sorted array, which is correct.
  - **Heap Operations**: The program correctly pops the smallest element, increments it, and pushes it back into the heap until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median.
  - **Counting Operations**: The number of operations is correctly counted and stored in the `results` list.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. It handles all specified edge cases and constraints, and the annotations confirm the correct state of the program at key points.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
