The code snippet assigns the `n` and `arr` variables the values from the `i`-th tuple in the `test_cases` list. The `i` variable is incremented by 1, but its new value is not captured or used in this snippet. The `results` list and the `t` variable remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` for the current test case, `n` and `arr` are the values from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `i` is `i + 1`.**
