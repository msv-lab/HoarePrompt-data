The code snippet `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` pushes the value `smallest + 1` onto the `heap`, which is a min-heap. This operation does not change the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`, `operations`, or `smallest`. It only modifies the `heap` by adding the new value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a min-heap of the elements from `arr` starting from `median_index` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1` minus the smallest element that was just popped, `operations` is 2, `smallest` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before it was popped, and `heap` now includes the value `smallest + 1` and `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`.**
