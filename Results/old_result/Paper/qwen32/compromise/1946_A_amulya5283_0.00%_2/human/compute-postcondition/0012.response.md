Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed, `operations` is 1, `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from the heap, and `heap` now includes `smallest + 1`.**

In this output state, the only variable that has changed is `operations`, which has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
