The code snippet assigns the value of `arr[median_index]` to the variable `current_median`. Given that `arr` is sorted and `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` will hold the median value of the list `arr`.

Since the initial state specifies that `arr` is the sorted second element of each tuple in `test_cases`, and `median_index` is calculated as `n // 2`, the value of `current_median` will be the middle element of `arr` if `n` is odd, or the lower of the two middle elements if `n` is even.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, and `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`.**
