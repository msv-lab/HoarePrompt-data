To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In the provided for loop:

```python
for i in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0, as `range(t)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `t-1`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`.
- `results` is an empty list.

Since `t` is already defined to be within the range 1 to 10^4, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be automatically initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, so no adjustment is needed for `i` either.

Thus, the state before the loop starts is already suitable for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is an empty list**
