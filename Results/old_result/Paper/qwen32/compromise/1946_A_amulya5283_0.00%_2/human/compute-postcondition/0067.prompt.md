Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of n integers a_i such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, arr = test_cases[i]
    arr.sort()
    median_index = n // 2
    current_median = arr[median_index]
    heap = arr[median_index:]
    heapq.heapify(heap)
    operations = 0
    while heap[0] <= current_median:
        smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
        heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
        operations += 1
    results.append(operations)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` where all elements are greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the total number of times the loop executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` for the current test case, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases` for the next iteration, `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases` for the next iteration, `median_index` is `n // 2` for the next iteration, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]` for the next iteration, `heap` is a min-heap of the elements from `arr` starting from `median_index` for the next iteration, `operations` is the total number of operations performed for the current test case.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` for the current test case, `n` and `arr` are the values from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` where the smallest element is greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the total number of operations performed in the loop, and `results` now includes the value of `operations`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
