The code snippet `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` removes the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. Given the initial state, `heap` was a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and then the smallest element of the heap was popped. After this operation, `heap` will have one less element, and `smallest` will hold the value of the smallest element that was just popped from the heap.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with one less element (the smallest element has been popped), `operations` is 2, `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from the heap, and `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median` and `heap` now contains an additional element `smallest + 1`.**
