The code snippet `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` pushes the value `smallest + 1` onto the heap. This means that the heap will now contain the value `smallest + 1` along with its previous elements. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `arr`, `i`, `arr` (sorted in non-decreasing order), `median_index`, `current_median`, and `smallest` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` for the current test case, `n` and `arr` are the values from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`, `operations` is 0, `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from `heap`.**
