The code snippet assigns the `heap` variable the value of the sublist of `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end of `arr`. Since `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `heap` will contain the median element and all elements greater than or equal to the median.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` for the current test case, `n` and `arr` are the values from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is `arr[median_index:]`.**
