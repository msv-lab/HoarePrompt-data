The code sorts the list `arr`. After sorting, `arr` will be in non-decreasing order. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`.**
