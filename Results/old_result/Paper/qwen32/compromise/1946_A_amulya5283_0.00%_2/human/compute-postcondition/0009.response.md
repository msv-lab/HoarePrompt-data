To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `heap[0] <= current_median`.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the given state and the loop condition:

1. **Variables in the loop head**: The loop condition involves `heap[0]` and `current_median`.
2. **Current state**:
   - `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]`.
   - `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`.

For the loop to execute, the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` must be true. This means that the smallest element in the `heap` (which is `heap[0]` due to heap properties) must be less than or equal to `current_median`.

Given the state:
- `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]`.
- `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`.

To ensure that `heap[0] <= current_median`, we need to consider the relationship between `heap[0]` and `current_median`. Since `heap[0]` is the smallest element in `heap`, and `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]`, `heap[0]` could be any element from `arr[median_index:]`.

If we want to ensure that the loop executes at least once, we need to make sure that `heap[0]` is indeed less than or equal to `current_median`. One straightforward way to ensure this is to make sure that `current_median` is the largest possible value in `arr[median_index:]` or that `heap[0]` is the smallest possible value that is still less than or equal to `current_median`.

However, since `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]`, the smallest element in `heap` (i.e., `heap[0]`) is the smallest element in `arr[median_index:]`. To ensure `heap[0] <= current_median`, we need to make sure that `arr[median_index:]` contains at least one element that is less than or equal to `current_median`.

In the worst case, we can ensure that `heap[0]` is equal to `current_median` by making sure that `arr[median_index]` (which is `current_median`) is the smallest element in `arr[median_index:]`. This can be achieved by ensuring that `arr` is sorted in such a way that `arr[median_index]` is indeed the smallest element in `arr[median_index:]`.

Thus, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`. Since `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]`, and `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, we need to ensure that `arr[median_index:]` contains at least one element that is less than or equal to `arr[median_index]`. This is naturally true if `arr` is sorted.

Therefore, no additional adjustment is needed beyond ensuring that `arr` is sorted as described, which is already part of the initial state.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]`, `operations` is 0**
