The code snippet `heapq.heapify(heap)` transforms the list `heap` into a heap data structure in-place. This operation does not change the elements of `heap` but reorders them to satisfy the heap property.

Given the initial state, the variable `heap` is initially set to `arr[median_index:]`, which is a sublist of the sorted array `arr` starting from the median index to the end of the array. After the `heapq.heapify(heap)` operation, `heap` will still contain the same elements but will be restructured to form a heap.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` for the current test case, `n` and `arr` are the values from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]`.**
