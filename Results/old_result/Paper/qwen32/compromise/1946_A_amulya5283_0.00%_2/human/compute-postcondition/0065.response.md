To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables involved.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - `median_index` is the middle index of `arr`.
   - `current_median` is the value at `median_index`.
   - `heap` is a heapified version of the second half of `arr` (from `median_index` to the end).
   - `operations` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as the smallest element in `heap` is less than or equal to `current_median`.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - The smallest element in `heap` is popped.
   - This element is incremented by 1 and pushed back into `heap`.
   - `operations` is incremented by 1.

### Final Output State:
The loop will terminate when the smallest element in `heap` is greater than `current_median`. At this point, no more elements in `heap` can be less than or equal to `current_median`, so the loop exits.

### Variables in the Final State:
- `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `arr`, `i`, `median_index`, and `current_median` remain unchanged.
- `heap` will contain elements where the smallest element is greater than `current_median`.
- `operations` will reflect the total number of times the loop ran, i.e., the number of times an element in `heap` was incremented.

### Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` for the current test case, `n` and `arr` are the values from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` where the smallest element is greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the total number of operations performed in the loop.**

In simpler terms, the loop will run until all elements in the heap are greater than the current median, and `operations` will count how many increments were made to achieve this.
