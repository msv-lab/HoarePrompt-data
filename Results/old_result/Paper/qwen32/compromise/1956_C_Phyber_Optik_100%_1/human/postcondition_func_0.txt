The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n`. For each test case, it calculates a specific sum based on the formula \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\) and prints this sum along with `2n`. It then prints a series of `n` lines, each containing a sequence of numbers describing positions in an `n√ón` matrix.
