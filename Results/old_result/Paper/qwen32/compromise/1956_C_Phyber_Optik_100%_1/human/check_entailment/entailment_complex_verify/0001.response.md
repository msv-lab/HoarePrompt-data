### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided solution and verify its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Recap:
- We aim to maximize the sum of all elements in an `n x n` matrix using no more than `2n` operations.
- Two types of operations are allowed:
  - Type 1: Fill a row with a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`.
  - Type 2: Fill a column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`.
- The goal is to maximize the sum of the matrix elements.

#### Solution Analysis:
1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum is calculated as `1 + (4 - 1) * 2 + (9 - 4) * 3 + ... + (n^2 - (n-1)^2) * n`.
   - This simplifies to `1 + 3*2 + 5*3 + ... + (2n-1)*n`.
   - The formula can be further simplified to \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\), which represents the sum of the first `n` triangular numbers multiplied by their respective indices.

2. **Operations:**
   - The solution performs `n` Type 1 operations followed by `n` Type 2 operations.
   - For each `j` from 1 to `n`, it performs:
     - Type 1 operation on row `n-j+1` with permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
     - Type 2 operation on column `n-j+1` with permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

3. **Verification of Sum Calculation:**
   - For `n = 1`: The sum is `1`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 2`: The sum is `1 + 3*2 = 7`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 3`: The sum is `1 + 3*2 + 5*3 = 1 + 6 + 15 = 22`, which is correct.

4. **Verification of Operations:**
   - The operations are designed to fill the matrix in a way that maximizes the sum. The alternating pattern between rows and columns ensures that each number is placed optimally.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations confirm that the sum is calculated correctly and that the operations are performed as intended.
- The state at the end of the function confirms that the sum is \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\) and that `j` is `n + 1`.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly calculates the maximum sum and provides a valid sequence of operations to achieve that sum within the allowed number of operations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
