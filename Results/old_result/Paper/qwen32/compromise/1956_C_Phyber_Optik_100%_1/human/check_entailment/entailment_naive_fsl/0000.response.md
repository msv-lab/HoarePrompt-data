Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not produce the correct output for the given problem description. Let's analyze the code and the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Objective**: Maximize the sum of all the numbers in an \( n \times n \) matrix.
2. **Operations**:
   - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \). Set \( a_{i,j} = p_j \) for all \( j \).
   - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \). Set \( a_{j,i} = p_j \) for all \( j \).
3. **Constraints**:
   - Use no more than \( 2n \) operations.
   - The maximum sum can always be obtained in no more than \( 2n \) operations.
4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - For each operation, specify the type, the row/column index, and the permutation.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code calculates the sum as follows:
```python
sum = 1
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
```
This formula calculates the sum of the first \( n \) squares multiplied by their respective indices. However, the code does not actually perform the operations on the matrix to achieve this sum.

The code then prints the calculated sum and \( 2n \) operations, but it does not correctly implement the operations to achieve the maximum sum. The operations printed are:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
    print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```
These operations do not guarantee that the matrix will be filled in a way that maximizes the sum.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the case when \( n = 2 \):
- The maximum sum should be \( 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 8 \).
- The operations should be:
  - Set the first row to [1, 2].
  - Set the second row to [2, 3].

However, the code will print:
```
7 4
1 2 1 2
2 2 1 2
1 1 1 2
2 1 1 2
```
This does not achieve the maximum sum of 8.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the operations to achieve the maximum sum for the matrix. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
