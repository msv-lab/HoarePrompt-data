To determine if the provided program is correct, let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the sum of all the numbers in an \( n \times n \) matrix \( a \) using at most \( 2n \) operations. The operations are:
1. Assign a row \( i \) with a permutation \( p \).
2. Assign a column \( i \) with a permutation \( p \).

The maximum sum can be achieved by filling the matrix in such a way that each number from 1 to \( n \) appears as many times as possible in the matrix. The best way to do this is to fill the matrix such that each row and each column contains all numbers from 1 to \( n \). This ensures that each number from 1 to \( n \) appears exactly \( n \) times in the matrix, maximizing the sum.

### Correctness of the Solution
The provided solution attempts to achieve the maximum sum by performing operations on the matrix. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{sum} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \times i
     \]
   - Simplifying the formula:
     \[
     \text{sum} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \times i = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)
     \]
   - This formula seems incorrect because it doesn't directly compute the maximum possible sum, which is simply the sum of all numbers from 1 to \( n \) repeated \( n \) times:
     \[
     \text{sum} = n \times \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} i \right) = n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2}
     \]

2. **Operations**:
   - The solution performs \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations.
   - Each operation assigns a row or a column with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - This approach does not guarantee that each number from 1 to \( n \) appears exactly \( n \) times in the matrix.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum sum and does not guarantee that each number from 1 to \( n \) appears exactly \( n \) times in the matrix. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
