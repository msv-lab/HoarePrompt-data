Let's break down the provided code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State
- `sum` is the result of some series computation for the given `n`, but it is not used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
- `n` is 5.
- `j` is not defined in the initial state, so we need to assume it is not used in the calculation or it is defined elsewhere in the code which is not provided. Since it's not provided, let's assume it's a typo or not relevant for the current `print` statement. If it's not defined, the code would raise an error. To proceed, we'll assume `j` is a variable that should be defined and for the sake of this task, we'll assume a value for `j`. However, since it's not defined, we can't proceed without it. Let's assume `j` is 0 for the sake of this explanation.

### Code Analysis
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

#### Step-by-Step Calculation
1. **First Argument: `2`**
   - This is a constant value 2.

2. **Second Argument: `n - j + 1`**
   - Given `n` is 5 and assuming `j` is 0 (as we don't have its value),
   - Calculation: `5 - 0 + 1 = 6`.

3. **Third Argument: `*range(1, n + 1)`**
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - Since `n` is 5, `range(1, 6)` generates the sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
   - The `*` operator unpacks this sequence into individual arguments for the `print` function.

### Final Output
Combining all the parts, the `print` statement will output:
- First argument: `2`
- Second argument: `6`
- Unpacked range: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`

Therefore, the final output will be:
Output: **2, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5**
