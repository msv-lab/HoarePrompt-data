The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 6, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `j` is currently 6, it must be incremented by 1 to 7 for the next iteration to potentially occur, and `n` must be at least 7 for the loop to continue.

State: **`sum` is 95, `n` must be greater than or equal to 7, `j` is 7, `t` is 1**
