The code modifies the value of `sum` based on the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming `i` is defined elsewhere in the code and is a valid integer, we can proceed with the calculation using `i`.

Let's simplify the expression:
\[ (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i = (i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1)) * i = (2i - 1) * i = 2i^2 - i \]

Thus, the new value of `sum` will be:
\[ \text{sum} = \text{sum} + (2i^2 - i) \]

Given that the initial value of `sum` is 1, the new value of `sum` becomes:
\[ \text{sum} = 1 + (2i^2 - i) \]

The other variables `n`, `j`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sum` is 1 + (2i^2 - i), `n` must be at least 2, `j` is `n + 1`, `t` is 2**.
