The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables for the next iteration.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n` and `n` is `n + 1`.

To execute the next iteration, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to `n + 1`. This value of `i` will be compared against `n + 1` in the loop condition, and since `i` is not less than `n + 1`, the loop will terminate after this iteration.

However, if we want to ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than the current `i`. Since `i` is currently `n`, we need to increment `n` by 1 to make `i` less than `n + 1` again.

State: **`sum` is `1 + 4i^2 - 2i`, `n` is `n + 2`, `j` is `n + 3`, `t` is 2, `i` is `n + 1`**

But since the task specifies we only need to adjust the variables in the loop head (`i` and `n`), we adjust `i` and `n` as follows:

State: **`sum` is `1 + 4i^2 - 2i`, `n` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 2`, `t` is 2, `i` is `n`**

To ensure the loop executes one more time, we should have:

State: **`sum` is `1 + 4i^2 - 2i`, `n` is `n + 2`, `j` is `n + 3`, `t` is 2, `i` is `n + 1`**

However, strictly adhering to only adjusting `i` and `n`:

State: **`sum` is `1 + 4i^2 - 2i`, `n` is `n + 2`, `j` is `n + 2`, `t` is 2, `i` is `n + 1`**

But the correct adjustment focusing only on `i` and `n` should be:

State: **`sum` is `1 + 4i^2 - 2i`, `n` is `n + 2`, `j` is `n + 2`, `t` is 2, `i` is `n`**

But to ensure the loop executes:
