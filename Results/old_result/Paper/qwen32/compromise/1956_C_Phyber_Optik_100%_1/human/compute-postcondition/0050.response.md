To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given code snippet based on the initial state provided.

Initial State:
- `sum` is 1 + (2i^2 - i)
- `n` is `n + 1`
- `j` is `n + 2`
- `t` is 2
- `i` is `n`

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
```

Let's calculate the impact of the code snippet on the variables.

The expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` can be simplified as follows:
- `i * i` is `i^2`
- `(i - 1) * (i - 1)` is `(i - 1)^2`
- The difference `i^2 - (i - 1)^2` simplifies to `i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1)` which is `2i - 1`
- Multiplying by `i` gives `(2i - 1) * i` which is `2i^2 - i`

Thus, the code snippet effectively adds `2i^2 - i` to `sum`.

Given that the initial value of `sum` is `1 + (2i^2 - i)`, after executing the code snippet, the new value of `sum` becomes:
- `sum = 1 + (2i^2 - i) + (2i^2 - i)`
- `sum = 1 + 2(2i^2 - i)`
- `sum = 1 + 4i^2 - 2i`

The values of `n`, `j`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sum` is `1 + 4i^2 - 2i`, `n` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 2`, `t` is 2, `i` is `n`**.
