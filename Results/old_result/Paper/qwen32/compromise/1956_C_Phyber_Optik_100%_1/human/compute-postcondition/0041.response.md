Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to determine exactly what will be printed.

Initial State:
- `sum` is 95 (though this variable is not used in the print statement)
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 8
- `j` is 8
- `t` is 1

Code Snippet:
```python
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's analyze the print statement:

1. The first argument is the integer `1`.
2. The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given that `n` is at least 8 and `j` is 8, this simplifies to `n - 8 + 1`, which is `n - 7`.
3. The third argument is `*range(1, n + 1)`. This will unpack the range from 1 to `n` inclusive. Since `n` is at least 8, the range will be from 1 to 8, 9, 10, etc., up to `n`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified beyond it being greater than or equal to 8, we will consider the minimum value of `n` which is 8 for this explanation.

- If `n` is 8, then `n - 7` is `8 - 7`, which equals `1`.
- The range `*range(1, n + 1)` will be `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8`.

Combining all these, the output will be:
```
1 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
```

Output: **1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8**
