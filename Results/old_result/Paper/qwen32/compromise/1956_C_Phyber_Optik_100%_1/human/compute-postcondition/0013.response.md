The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the `range(1, n + 1)` will generate numbers starting from 1 up to `n` inclusive. The initial value of `j` is not set before the loop starts, as it is automatically initialized by the `range` function in each iteration. However, we need to ensure that `n` is set correctly for the loop to execute at least once.

The state of `sum` is given as the result of the series computation for the given `n`, which is 102 when `n` is 5. However, since we are only allowed to adjust the states of `j` and `n`, we do not need to modify `sum`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be set to a value that is at least 1. Since the example provides `n = 5` for a specific sum, we can use that value to guarantee the loop will run and the sum will be computed as expected.

State: **`sum` is the result of the series computation for the given `n`, `n` is 5**
