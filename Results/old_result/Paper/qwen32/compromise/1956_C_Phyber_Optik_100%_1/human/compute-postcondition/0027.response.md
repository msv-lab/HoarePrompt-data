The code modifies the value of `sum` by adding the result of the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to it. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot compute the exact new value of `sum`. The other variables `n`, `j`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sum` is updated by adding `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to it, `n` must be at least 2, `j` is 6, `t` is 1.**
