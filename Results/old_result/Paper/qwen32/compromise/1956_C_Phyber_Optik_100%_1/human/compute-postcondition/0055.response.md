The only variable in the loop head is `j`, and the range function is defined by `1` and `n + 1`. To ensure that the loop executes, `n` must be at least 1, because `range(1, n + 1)` will generate numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. If `n` is 0 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

The current state before the loop starts is:
- `sum` is \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\)
- `n` is the input integer
- `j` is \(n + 1\)
- `t` is 2

To make sure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. The value of `j` before the loop starts should be 1, as the loop will initialize `j` to 1 in its first iteration.

State: **`sum` is \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `t` is 2**
