Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to determine the output.

Initial State:
- `sum` is the result of some series computation for the given `n`, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `n` is 5.
- `j` is 5.

The print statement is:
```python
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's evaluate each part of the print statement:
1. `1`: This is a constant value, so it will simply print `1`.
2. `n - j + 1`: Given `n` is 5 and `j` is 5, the expression evaluates to `5 - 5 + 1`, which simplifies to `1`.
3. `*range(1, n + 1)`: The `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. Since `n` is 5, this will generate the sequence `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`. The `*` operator unpacks this sequence, so it will print each number in the sequence separately.

Combining all these parts, the print statement will output:
`1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5`

Output: **1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5**
