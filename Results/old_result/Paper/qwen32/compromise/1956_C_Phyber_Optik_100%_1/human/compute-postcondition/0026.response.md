To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(2, n + 1):`, which means the loop will iterate over the range starting from 2 up to, but not including, `n + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Range and `n`**: The loop will execute if `n + 1` is greater than 2. This means `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute. If `n` is less than 2, the loop will not execute.
2. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 2 on the first iteration if `n` is at least 2. We don't need to adjust `i` before the loop starts because it is set by the `range` function.
3. **Other Variables (`sum`, `j`, `t`)**: These variables are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. Their values before the loop start do not affect whether the loop will execute.

### Conclusion:
The only variable that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `n`. It must be at least 2.

State: **`sum` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `j` is 6, `t` is 1**
