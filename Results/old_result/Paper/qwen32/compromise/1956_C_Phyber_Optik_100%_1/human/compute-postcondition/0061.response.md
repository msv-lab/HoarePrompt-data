To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration: `sum` is \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `t` is 2.
- The loop statement: `for j in range(1, n + 1):`.

In the previous iteration, `j` was 2. At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1 (since the loop variable `j` in `range(1, n + 1)` will take the next integer value).

Therefore:
- `j` will be 3.
- `n` remains the same since it is the upper bound of the range and does not change during the loop iterations.

The state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`sum` is \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3, `t` is 2**.
