Let's break down the given code snippet and determine what will be printed based on the initial state provided.

### Given:
- `sum` is defined as \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\)
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `j` is 3
- `t` is 2

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. The print statement consists of three parts:
   - The number `1`
   - The expression `n - j + 1`
   - The unpacked range `*range(1, n + 1)`

2. **First Part**: The number `1` is directly printed as is.
3. **Second Part**: The expression `n - j + 1`
   - Given `j` is 3, the expression simplifies to `n - 3 + 1` or `n - 2`.
4. **Third Part**: The unpacked range `*range(1, n + 1)`
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
   - The `*` operator unpacks this sequence, so each number in the sequence is printed as a separate argument.

### Output:
- The first value printed is `1`.
- The second value printed is `n - 2`.
- The remaining values printed are the numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Final Output Description:
Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we can describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **1, n - 2, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 1)**
