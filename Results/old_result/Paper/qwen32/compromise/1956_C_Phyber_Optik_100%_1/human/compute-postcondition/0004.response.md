In the given task, the for loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the range `range(2, n + 1)` is not empty. This range is non-empty if `n + 1` is greater than `2`, which means `n` must be at least `2`.

Let's analyze the state before the loop starts:

- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `sum` is 1.

The variable `t` does not affect the execution of this specific for loop since it is not part of the loop's range. The variable `sum` is also not part of the loop's range and does not affect whether the loop will execute.

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `n`. We need to make sure `n` is at least `2` for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer that must be at least 2; `sum` is 1**.
