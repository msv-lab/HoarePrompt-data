The function accepts a tuple `args` containing the arguments passed to the function `func`. It returns the value associated with the key `args` in the dictionary `d`. If `args` is not already a key in `d`, it computes `func(*args)`, stores the result in `d` with `args` as the key, and then returns this newly computed value. If `args` is already a key in `d`, it simply returns the pre-existing value associated with `args`.
