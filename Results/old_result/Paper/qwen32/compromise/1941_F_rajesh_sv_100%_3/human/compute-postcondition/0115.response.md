Postcondition: **`max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged. `left` and `right` remain `A[index - 1]` and `A[index]`, respectively. `f` remains the next value in `F`. `l` equals `h`, indicating the final index found. `mid` and `mid_next_sum` reflect the last calculations in the loop. `ans` is updated to the minimum value of `max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f)`. The condition `l == h` is true.**
