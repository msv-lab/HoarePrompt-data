Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurs; `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged; `left` is `A[index - 1]`; `right` is `A[index]`; `ans` is `max_diff`.
Code of the loop:
for f in F:
    l = bisect_right(D, left - f)
    h = bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1
    while l < h:
        mid = l + (h - l) // 2
        mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
        if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            h = mid
    if l == h:
        ans = min(ans, max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurs; `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged; `left` is `A[index - 1]`; `right` is `A[index]`; if `l` and `h` are equal, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f)`. `l` and `h` are equal and represent the final index from the binary search; `mid` is the last calculated middle index; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurs; `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged; `left` is `A[index - 1]`; `right` is `A[index]`; `l` and `h` are equal and represent the final index from the binary search; `mid` is the last calculated middle index; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`; `f` is the next value in `F`. If `l` equals `h`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged. `left` and `right` remain `A[index - 1]` and `A[index]`, respectively. `f` remains the next value in `F`. `l` equals `h`, indicating the final index found. `mid` and `mid_next_sum` reflect the last calculations in the loop. `ans` is updated to the minimum value of `max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f)`. The condition `l == h` is true.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
