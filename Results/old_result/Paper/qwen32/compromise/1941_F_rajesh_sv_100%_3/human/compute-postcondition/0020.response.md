The code snippet `index = i` assigns the value of `i` to `index`. Given that `i` is 3 and `index` was also 3, the value of `index` remains unchanged. The other variables (`n`, `diff`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`, `max_diff` is `diff`, `next_max_diff` is the previous value of `max_diff`, `index` is 3, `i` is 3**.
