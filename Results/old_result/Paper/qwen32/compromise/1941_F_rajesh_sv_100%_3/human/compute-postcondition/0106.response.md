The only variable in the loop head is `l` and `h`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `l < h`. If `l` is less than `h`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `l` and `h` are not explicitly given, but we need to ensure that `l` is less than `h` for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, we need to adjust the states of `l` and `h` such that this condition holds true.

State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurs; `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged; `left` is `A[index - 1]`; `right` is `A[index]`; `f` is the next value in `F`; `h` is adjusted based on the condition: if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` becomes `mid + 1`; otherwise, `h` becomes `mid`. `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`; `l` must be less than `h`**
