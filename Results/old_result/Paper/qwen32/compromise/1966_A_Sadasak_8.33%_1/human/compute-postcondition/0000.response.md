Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number written on a card, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, the length of `arr` is `n`, where 1 <= n <= 100, and `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary.**

Natural Language: The variable `frequency_table` has been initialized as an empty dictionary. The initial state of `arr` and `k` remains unchanged.
