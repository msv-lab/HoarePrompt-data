Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the described operations. Let's analyze why:

### Issues in the Code

1. **Incorrect Frequency Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return a frequency table of the card numbers, but it incorrectly caps the frequency at `k`. This is not necessary and incorrect for the problem. The frequency table should just count the occurrences of each card number.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Cards**:
   - The program does not correctly compute the minimum number of cards that can be left. The logic for determining the minimum number of cards is flawed. The program checks if `k` is in the frequency table values, which is not a valid condition to determine the minimum number of cards.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - The program does not handle cases where all cards are the same or when there are multiple card numbers with frequencies greater than `k`.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
- Count the frequency of each card number.
- For each card number, determine how many times we can perform the operation (i.e., divide the frequency by `k` and take the integer part).
- The number of cards left for each card number will be the remainder of the frequency divided by `k`.
- Sum these remainders to get the minimum number of cards left.

### Correct Example

Let's consider the first test case:
```
5 3
4 1 1 4 4
```
- Frequencies: `4 -> 3`, `1 -> 2`
- For `4`: We can perform the operation once (`3 // 3 = 1`), leaving `3 % 3 = 0` cards.
- For `1`: We cannot perform the operation (`2 // 3 = 0`), leaving `2 % 3 = 2` cards.
- Total cards left: `0 + 2 = 2`

### Revised Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in nums:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    min_cards = 0
    for freq in frequency_table.values():
        min_cards += freq % k
    
    print(min_cards)
```

This program correctly computes the minimum number of cards left by considering the remainder of the frequency of each card number divided by `k`.
