To determine the output state after the loop finishes, let's analyze the provided loop:

1. The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. For each iteration, it reads an integer `x` (with 2 <= x <= 1000).
3. It calculates `y` as the integer division of `x` by 2 (`y = x // 2`).
4. It prints the value of `y`.

Since the loop reads and processes each test case independently and only prints the results, the final state of the variables `t` and `x` after the loop completes will be:

- `t` will remain unchanged as it is the number of test cases.
- `x` will be the value of the last test case read by the loop, but since `x` is reassigned in each iteration, its final value is not significant for the output state as it is not retained outside the loop.
- The variable `y` will hold the value calculated in the last iteration, but similar to `x`, it is not retained outside the loop.

The output state will be described by the printed values of `y` for each test case, not by the state of the variables themselves after the loop.

However, if we strictly adhere to the format requested and focus on the state of the variables mentioned:

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and x is the integer value from the last test case (2 <= x <= 1000).**
