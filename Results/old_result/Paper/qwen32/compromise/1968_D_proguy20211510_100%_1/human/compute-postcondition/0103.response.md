Output State: **`i` is `min(len(paths), k)`, `pres` is the sum of `paths[0]` to `paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1]`, `preb`, `resb`, `vis`, `ps` (before the final update), `pb` (before the final update), and `ress` (before the final update) remain unchanged. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, then `ress` is updated to the value of `resb`. Otherwise, `ress` remains unchanged. `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are now integers. `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input. `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input. `pathb` is an empty list. `paths` is an empty list.**

Natural language: The variables `i`, `pres`, `preb`, `resb`, `vis`, `ps`, `pb`, and `ress` remain unchanged. The variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers, and `p` and `a` are lists of integers obtained from the input. The variables `pathb` and `paths` are now empty lists.
