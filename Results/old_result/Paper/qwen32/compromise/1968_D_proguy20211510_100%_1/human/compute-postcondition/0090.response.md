The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'Bodya'. The initial state provides information about several variables (`i`, `pres`, `ress`, `preb`, `resb`, `paths`, `vis`, `ps`, `pb`, `ress` before the final update, and `pres` before the final update) but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('Bodya')`.
2. The string 'Bodya' is explicitly specified in the `print` statement.
3. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state are referenced in the `print` statement, so their values do not influence the output.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string 'Bodya'.

Output: **Bodya**
