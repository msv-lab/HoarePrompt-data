The `break` statement exits the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of the variables `pathb`, `i`, `preb`, `curr`, or `resb`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with the additional information that the loop or if statement is broken out of.

Output State: **`pathb` contains at least two elements, `i` is 2, `preb` is `preb + pathb[1]`, `curr` is `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, `resb` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
