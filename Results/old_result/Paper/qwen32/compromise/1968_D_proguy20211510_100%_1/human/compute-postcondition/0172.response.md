Output State: **`resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during iterations, `ress` is `max(ress, curr)`, `preb` is the sum of all elements of `pathb` up to the point where `k < i + 1`, `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`, `paths` must have at least one element, and the loop or conditional block is exited. `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

The values of the variables `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, `pres`, `paths`, `curr`, and `i` remain as described in the initial state, except that the loop or conditional block is exited due to the `break` statement.
