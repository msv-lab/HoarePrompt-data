The code snippet `pathb.append(a[pb - 1])` appends the value of `a[pb - 1]` to the list `pathb`. Given that `pathb` initially contains only the element `a[pb - 1]`, after this operation, `pathb` will contain two identical elements, both being `a[pb - 1]`.

Here are the variables and their states after the code execution:
- `i` remains `min(len(paths), k)`.
- `pres` remains the sum of `paths[0]` to `paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1]`.
- `vis` remains a list of `n` zeros except `vis[pb - 1]` which is 1.
- `preb`, `resb`, `ps`, `pb`, and `ress` remain unchanged.
- `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain integers.
- `p` and `a` remain lists of integers obtained from the input.
- `paths` remains an empty list.
- `vis[pb - 1]` remains 1.
- `pathb` now contains two elements, both `a[pb - 1]`.

Output State: **`i` is `min(len(paths), k)`, `pres` is the sum of `paths[0]` to `paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1]`, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except `vis[pb - 1]` which is 1, `preb`, `resb`, `ps`, `pb`, and `ress` remain unchanged, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers, `p` and `a` are lists of integers obtained from the input, `paths` is an empty list, `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, `pathb` is a list containing two elements, both `a[pb - 1]`.**
