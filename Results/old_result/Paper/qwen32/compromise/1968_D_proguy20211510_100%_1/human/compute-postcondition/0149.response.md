The variable `preb` is incremented by the value of `pathb[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `preb` is `preb + pathb[i]`, `pres` is 0, `pathb` is a list with at least one element, `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`.

Output State: **`resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `preb` is `preb + pathb[i]`, `pres` is 0, `pathb` is a list with at least one element, `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`**.
