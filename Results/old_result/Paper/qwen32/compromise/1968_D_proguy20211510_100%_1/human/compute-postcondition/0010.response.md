Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(t \geq 1\); `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers; `p` is a list of integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `pathb` is an empty list; `paths` is an empty list; `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except `vis[pb - 1]` which is 1.**

In natural language, the output state means that the value at index `pb - 1` of the list `vis` has been changed to 1, while all other values in `vis` remain 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
