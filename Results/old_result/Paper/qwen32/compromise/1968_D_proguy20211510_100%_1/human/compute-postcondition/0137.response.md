The code snippet appends `a[ps - 1]` to the list `paths`. Given the initial state, `paths` initially contains `a[ps - 1]` twice. After appending `a[ps - 1]` again, `paths` will contain `a[ps - 1]` three times.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `i` remains `min(len(paths), k)`.
- `pres` remains the sum of `paths[0]` to `paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1]`.
- `vis` remains a list of `n` zeros except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1.
- `preb`, `resb`, `ps`, `pb`, `ress`, `n`, `k`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- `pathb` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `min(len(paths), k)`, `pres` is the sum of `paths[0]` to `paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1]`, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `preb`, `resb`, `ps`, `pb`, `ress`, `n`, `k`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged, `pathb` remains unchanged, `paths` is a list containing `a[ps - 1]` three times.**
