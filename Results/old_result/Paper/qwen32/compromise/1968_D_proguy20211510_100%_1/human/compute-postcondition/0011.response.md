In this case, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop. This means that the loop will execute indefinitely as long as the program does not encounter a `break` statement or some other mechanism to exit the loop. Since the loop condition is always `True`, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the state right before the loop can be repeated as is.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(t \geq 1\); `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers; `p` is a list of integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `pathb` is an empty list; `paths` is an empty list; `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except `vis[pb - 1]` which is 1.**
