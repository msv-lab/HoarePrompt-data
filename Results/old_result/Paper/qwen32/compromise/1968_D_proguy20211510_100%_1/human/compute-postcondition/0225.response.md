Postcondition: **`vis[pb - 1]` is 0, `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `preb` is unchanged, `pres` is the sum of the first `i_final + 1` elements of `paths`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the index that causes the loop to terminate, `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the elements from `a` corresponding to the indices in the cycle, `paths` is a list containing the element `a[ps - 1]`, and the loop breaks.**

This postcondition summarizes that the state of the variables remains as described in the precondition, with the additional detail that the loop breaks because the condition `vis[ps - 1] == 1` is true.
