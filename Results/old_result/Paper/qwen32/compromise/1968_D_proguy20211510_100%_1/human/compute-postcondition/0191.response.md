Postcondition: **`resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `preb` is unchanged, and `pres` is the sum of the first `i_final + 1` elements of `paths`. If the current value of `ress` is greater than the original `resb`, then `resb` is updated to the value of `ress`. Otherwise, `resb` remains equal to `ress`.**
