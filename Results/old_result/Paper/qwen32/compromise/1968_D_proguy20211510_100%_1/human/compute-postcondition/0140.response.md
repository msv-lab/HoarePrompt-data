Postcondition: **`i` is `min(len(paths), k)`, `pres` is the sum of `paths[0]` to `paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1]`, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `preb`, `resb`, `pb`, `ress`, `n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, and `paths` remain unchanged, `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`. The condition `vis[ps - 1] == 1` is always true, so the else part is never executed.**
