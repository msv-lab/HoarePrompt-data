The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts those components to integers, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `p`. This operation does not affect any of the other variables listed in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `min(len(paths), k)`, `pres` is the sum of `paths[0]` to `paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1]`, `preb`, `resb`, `paths`, `vis`, `ps` (before the final update), `pb` (before the final update), and `ress` (before the final update) remain unchanged. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, then `ress` is updated to the value of `resb`. Otherwise, `ress` remains unchanged. `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are now integers. `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
