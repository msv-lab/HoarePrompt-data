The code snippet `ps = p[ps - 1]` updates the value of `ps` by setting it to the value at index `ps - 1` of the list `p`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`vis` is a list of zeros with length `n` except `vis[ps - 1]` is 1; the loop breaks when `vis[pb - 1] == 1`; `pathb` will contain the sequence of elements `a[pb - 1]` until the cycle is detected; `pb` will be the value that causes the cycle detection; `paths` now includes `a[ps - 1]` at the end; `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`.**
