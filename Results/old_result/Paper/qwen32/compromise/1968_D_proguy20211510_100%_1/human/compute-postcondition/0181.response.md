The code snippet `pres += paths[i]` increments `pres` by the value of `paths[i]`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the value of `pres` is updated to `pres + paths[i]`. The other variables (`resb`, `ress`, `preb`, `curr`, `paths`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during iterations, `ress` is `max(ress, curr)`, `preb` is the sum of all elements of `pathb` up to the point where `k < i + 1`, `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`, `paths` must have at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`**.
