The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `pathb`. If `i` is less than the length of `pathb`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The length of `pathb` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`pathb` contains at least two elements, `i` is 2, `preb` is `preb + pathb[1]`, `curr` is `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, `resb` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr`. If `k < i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
