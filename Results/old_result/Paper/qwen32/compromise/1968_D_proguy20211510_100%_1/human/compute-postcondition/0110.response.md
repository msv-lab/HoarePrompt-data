Output State: **`i` is `min(len(paths), k)`, `pres` is the sum of `paths[0]` to `paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1]`, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except `vis[pb - 1]` which is 1, `preb`, `resb`, `ps`, `pb`, and `ress` remain unchanged, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers, `p` and `a` are lists of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, and `pb` is now `p[pb - 1]`. The loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the loop or if statement to terminate immediately, but it does not change the values of any of the variables. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values, and the only change is that the control flow breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
