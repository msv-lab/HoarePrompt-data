For the given `while True` loop, the loop is designed to run indefinitely unless there is a break statement inside the loop body. Since the loop condition is always `True`, the state at the end of the previous iteration does not need to be modified for the loop to execute one more time. The loop will continue to run as long as it is not explicitly broken out of within the loop body.

Therefore, the state remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(t \geq 1\); `n`, `k`, and `ps` are integers; `p` is a list of integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`; `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1], a[pb - 1]`; `paths` is an empty list; `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except `vis[pb - 1]` which is 1. If `vis[pb - 1] == 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
