Output State: **`i` is 1, `paths` is a list with at least 1 element, `preb` is the sum of `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` across all iterations, `vis`, `ps`, `pb`, `ress` is the maximum value of `ress` and `curr`, `pres` is `pres + paths[0]`, and `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`**.

In simpler terms, the value of `curr` has been updated to `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state provided.
