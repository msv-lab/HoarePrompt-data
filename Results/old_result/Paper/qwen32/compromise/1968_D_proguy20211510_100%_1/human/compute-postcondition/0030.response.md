In this case, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute at least once regardless of the program state. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to ensure that the loop can execute the first time.

State: **`vis` is a list of zeros with length `n` except `vis[ps - 1]` is 1; the loop breaks when `vis[pb - 1] == 1`; `pathb` will contain the sequence of elements `a[pb - 1]` until the cycle is detected; `pb` will be the value that causes the cycle detection**.
