You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    #State: The final output state is determined by the last test case processed. Specifically, `resb` and `ress` will hold the maximum scores for `pathb` and `paths` respectively, and the program will print "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on the comparison of `resb` and `ress`. All other variables (`vis`, `pathb`, `paths`, `pb`, `ps`, `n`, `k`, `p`, `a`) will reflect the state of the last test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Overview of the Problem:
The problem involves two players, Bodya and Sasha, who play a game on a permutation and an array. Both players start at different positions and can either stay or move to the position indicated by the permutation. The players' scores increase based on the values in the array at their current positions. The player with the highest score after `k` turns wins.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - The program correctly converts these inputs to integers where necessary.

2. **Path Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the paths for both players by following the permutation until a cycle is detected.
   - It uses a visited array `vis` to detect cycles.
   - The paths are stored in `pathb` and `paths` for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - For each path, the program calculates the maximum possible score that can be achieved within `k` turns.
   - It does this by considering all possible stopping points within the cycle and calculating the score for each.
   - The score for each possible stopping point is calculated as the sum of the scores up to that point plus the score of the current position multiplied by the remaining turns.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - The program compares the maximum scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, and "Draw" if their scores are equal.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the cycle detection in the permutation, calculates the maximum possible score for each player within `k` turns, and correctly compares the scores to determine the winner.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the logic it implements.

Correctness: **True**
