### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" between Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions and the rules provided. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` (Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions).
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the score array `a`.

2. **Path Calculation:**
   - For both players, the program calculates the path they will take based on the permutation `p`.
   - It uses a `vis` array to track visited positions and avoid infinite loops.
   - The path for each player is stored in `pathb` and `paths`.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the maximum score each player can achieve by staying or moving to the next position in their path.
   - It uses a dynamic programming-like approach to calculate the score for each possible number of turns up to `k`.

4. **Comparison:**
   - After calculating the maximum possible scores for both players, the program compares them.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, and "Draw" if both scores are equal.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the winner of the game. Here are some key points that support this:

- **Path Calculation:** The program correctly identifies the cycle in the permutation and calculates the path for each player.
- **Score Calculation:** The program correctly calculates the maximum score for each player by considering all possible moves up to `k` turns.
- **Comparison:** The program correctly compares the scores and outputs the correct winner.

The program handles the constraints provided in the problem statement, including the large values of `k` (up to \(10^9\)) by only calculating scores up to the length of the cycle, ensuring efficiency.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to be correct based on the provided logic and the problem description. It handles all edge cases and efficiently calculates the required scores.

**Correctness: True**
