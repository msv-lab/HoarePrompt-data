### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, which represent the length of the permutation, the number of turns, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Cycle Detection and Path Calculation:**
   - The program detects cycles in the permutation for both Bodya and Sasha starting from their respective positions.
   - It uses a visited array `vis` to detect cycles and appends the values from `a` to `pathb` and `paths` for Bodya and Sasha, respectively, until a cycle is detected.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - For each path, the program calculates the maximum possible score within `k` turns.
   - It iterates through the path and calculates the score for each possible sequence of moves up to `k` turns. The score is calculated as the sum of the values from `a` multiplied by the number of remaining turns.
   - It keeps track of the maximum score for each player.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After calculating the maximum scores for both players, the program compares them.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, or "Draw" if their scores are equal.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules and constraints. It handles the cycle detection, score calculation, and comparison appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
