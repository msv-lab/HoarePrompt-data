### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can set up his jewelry store in such a way that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using at most 60 stalls. However, the logic in the current implementation is flawed and does not correctly solve the problem.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Base Cases Handling**:
   - When `n == k`, the program correctly prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel.
   - When `n < k`, the program correctly prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels if she has fewer coins than jewels.

2. **General Case Handling**:
   - The current logic for the general case (`n > k`) is incorrect. The program initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]` and then iterates over these costs to calculate the number of jewels Alice can buy. However, this approach does not ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - Specifically, the logic does not guarantee that the sum of the quotients (`h`) will be exactly `k`. It also does not ensure that the number of stalls used is at most 60.
   - The current implementation does not explore different possible stall prices and their combinations to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, Bob can use a greedy approach by setting up stalls with prices that ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One possible strategy is to use binary representation to determine the prices of the stalls. For example, if `k` can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2, Bob can set up stalls with prices corresponding to these powers of 2.

### Correctness:

Given the current implementation does not correctly handle the general case and does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**

### Suggested Fix:
Here's a suggested fix for the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(1)
    elif n < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        stalls = []
        remaining = k
        power = 0
        while remaining > 0:
            if remaining & 1:
                stalls.append(2 ** power)
            remaining >>= 1
            power += 1
        if len(stalls) > 60:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print(len(stalls))
            print(' '.join(map(str, stalls)))
```

This fix uses binary representation to determine the prices of the stalls, ensuring that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using at most 60 stalls.
