The `print(2)` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`n`, `k`, `costs`, `h`). The `print` function will output the integer `2` as specified.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides information about several variables (`n`, `k`, `costs`, `h`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is `print(2)`, which means it will output the integer `2`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables from the initial state, the output is simply the number `2`.

Output: **2**
