The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`n`, `k`, `costs`, `h`), but these variables are not used in the provided `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here is the breakdown of the relevant information:
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is unchanged (its exact value is not provided).
- `costs` is unchanged (its exact value is not provided).
- `h` is the sum of the quotients from the divisions performed in each iteration, and it is greater than or equal to `k`.

Since the `print` statement only outputs the string `'YES'` and does not reference any of the variables mentioned in the initial state, the output will simply be `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
