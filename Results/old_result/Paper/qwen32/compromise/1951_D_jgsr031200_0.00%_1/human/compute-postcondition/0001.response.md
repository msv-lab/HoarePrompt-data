The initial state provides information about two variables, `n` and `k`, both of which are positive integers within the range 1 to \(10^{18}\). Additionally, it specifies that the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`. However, the `print` statement in the provided code snippet is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement is independent of the values of `n` and `k`. It simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **YES**
