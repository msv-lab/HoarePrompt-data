Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for determining the maximum number of draws. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of draws is flawed and does not cover all possible scenarios, especially when the scores do not align with any valid set of games and results.

Let's analyze the issues in the provided program:

1. **Initial Check for Total Points Modulo 2**:
   - The program correctly checks if the total points `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0`. If true, it prints `-1` because the total points from games must be even (each game contributes either 2 points to the total or 2 points split between two players in case of a draw).

2. **Handling `p3 >= p1 + p2`**:
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the program prints `p1 + p2`. This is incorrect. The condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` implies that the player with the highest score (`p3`) could have won all games against the other two players, which would mean the other two players could have only drawn among themselves. However, the maximum number of draws is not necessarily `p1 + p2` in this case. It should be checked more carefully.

3. **Loop for Determining Draws**:
   - The loop attempts to determine the maximum number of draws by iterating through possible values of `cur`. However, the logic inside the loop is flawed. It does not correctly determine the maximum number of draws based on the scores.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        total_games = (p1 + p2 + p3) // 2
        max_draws = min(p1, p2, p3)
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            if p1 == p2 == 0:
                print(0)
            else:
                print(-1)
        else:
            max_draws = min(p1, p2, p3, p3 - p1, p3 - p2, total_games - (p3 - p1) - (p3 - p2))
            print(max_draws)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the maximum number of draws is calculated correctly, taking into account all possible scenarios and ensuring that the scores are consistent with a valid set of games.
