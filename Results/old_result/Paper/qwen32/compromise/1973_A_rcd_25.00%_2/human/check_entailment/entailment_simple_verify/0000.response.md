### Reasoning:

The original assessment claims that the code is incorrect based on specific test cases. Let's analyze the annotated code and the test cases provided to determine the correctness of the program.

1. **Sum of Scores Check:**
   - The code first checks if the sum of the scores `p1 + p2 + p3` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even since each game distributes 2 points (either 2-0 or 1-1).
   - This check is correct and ensures that the scores are consistent with the rules of the game.

2. **Case When `p3 >= p1 + p2`:**
   - If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`.
   - This is because `p3` could have won all games against `p1` and `p2` and still have enough points to cover `p1 + p2` in draws.
   - This logic is correct based on the problem constraints.

3. **Case When `p3 < p1 + p2`:**
   - The code calculates `low` and `high` as `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)` and `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, respectively.
   - It then iterates over possible values of `cur` from `low` to `high` to find a configuration where `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
   - If such a `cur` is found, it prints `p1 - cur + p3`.
   - If no such `cur` is found, it prints `p3`.

Let's verify the problematic test cases mentioned in the original assessment:

#### Test Case 1:
```
1
0 2 4
```
- **Expected Output:** `2`
- **Code Execution:**
  - `p1 + p2 + p3 = 0 + 2 + 4 = 6` (even)
  - `p3 < p1 + p2` (4 < 2 is false)
  - Since `p3 >= p1 + p2` is true, the code prints `p1 + p2 = 0 + 2 = 2`.
- **Actual Output:** `2`
- **Conclusion:** The code is correct for this test case.

#### Test Case 2:
```
1
1 1 2
```
- **Expected Output:** `2`
- **Code Execution:**
  - `p1 + p2 + p3 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4` (even)
  - `p3 < p1 + p2` (2 < 2 is false)
  - Since `p3 >= p1 + p2` is true, the code prints `p1 + p2 = 1 + 1 = 2`.
- **Actual Output:** `2`
- **Conclusion:** The code is correct for this test case.

Upon closer inspection, the original assessment seems to have incorrectly identified a failure in the code. The code correctly handles the test cases provided and follows the logic described in the annotations. The logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is consistent with the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
