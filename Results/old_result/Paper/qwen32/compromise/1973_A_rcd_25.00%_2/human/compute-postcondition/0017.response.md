The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The preconditions that `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; and `p1 - cur` is greater than `p2 - (p3 - cur)` still hold true after the code execution, with the updated value of `cur`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `cur` is `low + 1`; `p1 - cur` is greater than `p2 - (p3 - cur)`**.
