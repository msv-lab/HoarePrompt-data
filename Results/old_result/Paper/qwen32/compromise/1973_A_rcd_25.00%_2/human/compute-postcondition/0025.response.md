To determine what will be printed by the `print(p1 - cur + p3)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the relationships between the variables:

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive).
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` must be at least `cur`.

2. **Expressions and Relationships:**
   - Since `p3 < p1 + p2`, `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are both less than `p1` and `p2` respectively, but their exact values depend on the specific values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
   - `low` and `high` are derived from `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, with `low` being the smaller and `high` being the larger of the two differences.
   - The condition `high >= cur` indicates that `cur` is a value that is at most as large as the maximum difference between `p3` and either `p1` or `p2`.

3. **Expression to Evaluate:**
   - The expression `p1 - cur + p3` needs to be evaluated. Since `cur` is constrained by `high` (which is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`), we need to consider the possible values of `cur`.

4. **Specific Analysis:**
   - Without specific values for `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `cur`, we can still describe the output in terms of these variables.
   - The value of `p1 - cur + p3` depends on the specific values of `p1`, `p3`, and `cur`.

Given the constraints and the relationships between the variables, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **p1 - cur + p3 (where p1, p3, and cur are integers satisfying the given conditions)**
