The code snippet calculates the minimum and maximum values between `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and assigns them to `low` and `high` respectively. Given that `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers and their sum is odd, the values of `low` and `high` will be the smaller and larger of the two differences, respectively.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 499; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.**
