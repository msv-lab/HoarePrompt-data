To determine the output of the `print(p1 - cur + p3)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the relationships between the variables.

1. **Variables and Their Relationships**:
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). This variable does not affect the calculation of the print statement directly.
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `cur` is initialized to `low`.
   - The condition `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)` must hold.

2. **Expression Analysis**:
   - We need to evaluate `p1 - cur + p3`.
   - Since `cur` is set to `low`, we substitute `cur` with `low` in the expression.
   - The expression becomes `p1 - low + p3`.

3. **Simplification**:
   - We know `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - Let's consider two cases:
     - **Case 1**: If `low = p3 - p1`, then the expression becomes `p1 - (p3 - p1) + p3 = p1 - p3 + p1 + p3 = 2 * p1`.
     - **Case 2**: If `low = p3 - p2`, then the expression becomes `p1 - (p3 - p2) + p3 = p1 - p3 + p2 + p3 = p1 + p2`.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)` must hold.
   - Substituting `cur` with `low`, we get `p1 - low` should be less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - low)`.
   - Simplifying the right side, we have `p1 - low` should be less than or equal to `p2 - p3 + low`.
   - Rearranging, we get `p1 - low` should be less than or equal to `p2 - p3 + low` which simplifies to `p1 - p2 + p3` should be less than or equal to `2 * low`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the conditions and the expression, the most precise description based on the initial state is that the print statement will output `p1 - low + p3`, which simplifies to either `2 * p1` or `p1 + p2` depending on the value of `low`.

However, without specific values for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, we cannot definitively say which of the two cases will apply. Therefore, the output will be described in terms of the expression itself.

Output: **p1 - cur + p3 (where cur is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2)**
