The only variable in the loop head is `cur`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cur` and `high`. If `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1` based on the condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `cur` needs to be less than `high`. Since `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1`, we need to make sure that `high` is greater than `low + 1`.

Therefore, we need to adjust `high` to be greater than `low + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` and must be greater than `low + 1`; If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, `cur` remains `low`. Otherwise, `cur` is set to `low + 1`.**
