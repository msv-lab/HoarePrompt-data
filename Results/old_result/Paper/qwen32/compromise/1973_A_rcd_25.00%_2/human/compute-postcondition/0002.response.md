The code snippet `p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())` takes an input line, splits it into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the input operation in this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input.**
