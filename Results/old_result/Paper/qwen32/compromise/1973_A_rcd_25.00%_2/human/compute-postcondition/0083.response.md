To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop based on the given conditions. Here's the loop again for reference:

```python
while high >= cur:
    if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
        print(p1 - cur + p3)
        break
    else:
        cur += 1
else:
    print(p3)
```

### Analysis

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cur` is initialized to `low`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `high >= cur`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it increments `cur` by 1.

4. **Else Clause:**
   - If the loop exits without breaking (i.e., `high < cur`), it prints `p3`.

### Determining the Output State

- **First Iteration:** The loop starts with `cur` set to `low`.
- **Subsequent Iterations:** `cur` is incremented by 1 until the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met or `cur` exceeds `high`.

The loop will terminate in one of two ways:
1. **Condition Met:** The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is satisfied, and the loop prints `p1 - cur + p3` and exits.
2. **Exceeds High:** `cur` exceeds `high`, and the loop prints `p3` and exits.

### Final Output State

- If the loop exits because the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met, the output is `p1 - cur + p3`.
- If the loop exits because `cur` exceeds `high`, the output is `p3`.

Since the problem does not provide specific values for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, we can only describe the final output state in terms of these conditions.

### Conclusion

The final output state will be determined by whether the loop condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met at any point during the loop execution. If it is met, the output will be `p1 - cur + p3` for the specific `cur` value when the condition is met. If the loop completes without meeting the condition, the output will be `p3`.

Output State: **The output will be `p1 - cur + p3` if the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met during the loop execution; otherwise, it will be `p3`.**
