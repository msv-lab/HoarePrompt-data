You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. Each of the following t lines contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, representing the scores of the three players in a non-decreasing order.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            low, high = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)
            cur = low
            while high >= cur:
                if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                    print(p1 - cur + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    cur += 1
            else:
                print(p3)
        
    #State: The loop has processed all `t` input cases, each consisting of three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. For each case, the program checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1`. If the sum is even, the program checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`. If true, it prints the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Otherwise, it finds the largest possible value of `cur` such that `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` within the range defined by `low` and `high`, and prints `p1 - cur + p3`. If no such `cur` exists, it prints `p3`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, it receives three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, which represent the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. The function returns a value for each test case based on the scores, but the specific return values for different cases are not provided.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
