Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary, and `x` is the third element in `num_list`. If `x` is in `num_of_lens`, then `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `num_of_lens` has the key `x` with the value `1`.**
