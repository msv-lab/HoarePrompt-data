The only variable in the loop head is `cnt`, which iterates over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `cnt` for the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`
- `results` is a list containing the value of `res`
- `n` is the input integer
- `num_list` is the list of integers obtained from the input
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of that integer in `num_list`
- `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`

At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` has taken on the value of one of the counts from `num_of_lens`. For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must be the next value in the sequence of values from `num_of_lens`.

Let's denote the current value of `cnt` as `cnt_current`. The next value of `cnt` (let's call it `cnt_next`) should be the next value in the dictionary `num_of_lens` that has not yet been iterated over.

Since we do not have specific values for `num_of_lens`, we can only express the state in terms of the next value in the iteration sequence.

State: **`test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is the input integer, `num_list` is the list of integers obtained from the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of that integer in `num_list`, `total_count` is `total_count + cnt_current`, `cnt` is `cnt_next`**
