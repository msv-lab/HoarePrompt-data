The code snippet provided only includes `total_count += cnt`. This means that `total_count` is being incremented by the value of `cnt`. None of the other variables are directly modified in this snippet.

Given the initial state, the only change is to `total_count`, which is now `total_count + cnt`.

Output State: **`results` is a list with `res` appended to it. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is updated to the previous `res` plus `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. If `cnt` is 2, `res` is updated to the previous `res` plus `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged. `test_cases` is decremented by 1. `n` is an input integer. `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one integer. `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`. `cnt` is `next_cnt`.**
