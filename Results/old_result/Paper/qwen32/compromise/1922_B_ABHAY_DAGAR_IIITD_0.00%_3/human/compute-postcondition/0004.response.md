The code snippet provided initializes an empty dictionary `num_of_lens`. This action does not affect the values of `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, or `num_list`. The output state will reflect that `num_of_lens` is now an empty dictionary while other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary.**
