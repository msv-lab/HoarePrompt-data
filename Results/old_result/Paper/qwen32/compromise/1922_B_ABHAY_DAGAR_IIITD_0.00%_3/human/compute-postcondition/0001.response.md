Let's analyze the given for loop and the state before the loop starts.

The for loop is:
```python
for _ in range(test_cases):
    # the loop body is omit
```

In this loop, `test_cases` is the variable that determines how many times the loop will execute. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable that we do not need to worry about for the purpose of this task.

The state before the loop starts is:
- `test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple (n, a) such that n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and a is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
- `results` is an empty list.

However, the loop head only involves the variable `test_cases`. The loop will execute `len(test_cases)` times, which means we need to ensure that `test_cases` is a list with a length that is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `test_cases` is a list with at least one test case.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list**
