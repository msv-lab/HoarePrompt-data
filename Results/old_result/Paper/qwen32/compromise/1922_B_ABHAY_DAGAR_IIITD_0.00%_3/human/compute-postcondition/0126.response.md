The code snippet provided updates the value of `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to it. The values of other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly involved in the calculation or updated by the code.

Given the initial state:
- `results` is a list with `res` appended to it.
- `res` is updated based on the value of `next_cnt`.
- `test_cases` is decremented by 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one integer.
- `total_count` is updated to `total_count + next_cnt`.
- `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.
- `res` is further updated if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.

The code snippet specifically updates `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to it.

Therefore, the updated value of `res` will be the previous value of `res` plus `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.

Output State: **`results` is a list with `res` appended to it; `res` is updated to its previous value plus `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`; `test_cases` is decremented by 1; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one integer; `total_count` is `total_count + next_cnt`; `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`**.
