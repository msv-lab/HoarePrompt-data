Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `num_of_lens` will contain each unique integer from `num_list` as keys, with the values representing how many times each integer appears in `num_list`. All other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
