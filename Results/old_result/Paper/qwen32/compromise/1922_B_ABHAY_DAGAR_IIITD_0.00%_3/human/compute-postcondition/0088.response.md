In this task, the loop head involves the variable `_` and `test_cases`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable that does not hold any specific state that needs to be maintained across iterations. The variable `test_cases` determines how many times the loop will execute.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `results` is a list with `res` appended to it, and `res` holds its original value, we need to adjust the state of `test_cases` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute as long as the value of `_` is less than `test_cases`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have decremented the effective count of remaining iterations by 1.
3. Therefore, to execute one more iteration, `test_cases` must be decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's denote the value of `test_cases` at the end of the previous iteration as `x`. For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` should be `x - 1` at the start of the next iteration.

Since the exact value of `test_cases` at the end of the previous iteration is not provided, we can denote the new state as `test_cases` being one less than its previous value.

State: **`results` is a list with `res` appended to it; `res` holds its original value, `test_cases` is decremented by 1**
