The code snippet `res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` increases the value of `res` by the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 3 at a time, which is calculated by the formula `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. 

Given that `res` was initially 0, it will now be equal to `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. The other variables (`results`, `test_cases`, `n`, `num_list`, `total_count`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`results` is a list with `res` appended to it, where `res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`; `test_cases` is decremented by 1; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one integer; `total_count` is 0; `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.**
