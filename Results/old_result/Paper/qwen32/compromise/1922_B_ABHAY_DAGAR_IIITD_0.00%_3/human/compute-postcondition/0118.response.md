The code snippet increments `res` by the value of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. This means `res` is updated to its current value plus the new calculated combination value. 

Given the initial state, `results` already has `res` appended to it, and `res` is calculated based on the condition of `cnt`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `n`, `num_list`, `total_count`, and `cnt`) are not affected by this particular line of code.

Thus, the updated `res` value is added to `results` after the code execution. The other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`results` is a list with the updated `res` appended to it, where the updated `res` is the previous `res` plus `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`; `test_cases` is decremented by 1; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one integer; `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`; `cnt` is `next_cnt`.**
