The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. This means that `num_of_lens` is no longer empty but now contains one key-value pair: `x` with a value of `1`.

All other variables remain unchanged:
- `test_cases` is still a list of test cases with at least 1 test case.
- `results` is still an empty list.
- `n` is still an input integer.
- `num_list` is still a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 integer.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with one key-value pair `x: 1`, and `x` is a key in `num_of_lens`.**
