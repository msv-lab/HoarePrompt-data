The code snippet provided is `total_count += cnt`. This line increments the value of `total_count` by the value of `cnt`.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`
- `results` is a list containing the value of `res`
- `n` is the input integer
- `num_list` is the list of integers obtained from the input
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of that integer in `num_list`
- `total_count` is `total_count + cnt_current`
- `cnt` is `cnt_next`
- If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is incremented by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

After executing `total_count += cnt`, the value of `total_count` will be the previous `total_count` plus the value of `cnt`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is the input integer, `num_list` is the list of integers obtained from the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of that integer in `num_list`, `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`, `cnt` is `cnt_next`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is incremented by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.**
