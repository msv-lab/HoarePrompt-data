The code snippet provided is `results.append(res)`. This line of code appends the value of the variable `res` to the list `results`. 

Given the initial state, `results` was an empty list. After executing this line, `results` will contain one element, which is the value of `res`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`test_cases` remains a list of test cases with at least 1 test case; `results` is a list containing the value of `res`; `n` remains the input integer; `num_list` remains the list of integers obtained from the input; `num_of_lens` remains the dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`; `res` is updated to the final accumulated value after all iterations; `total_count` is updated to the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.**

In natural language, after appending `res` to `results`, `results` now contains the value of `res`. All other variables retain their initial values and states.
