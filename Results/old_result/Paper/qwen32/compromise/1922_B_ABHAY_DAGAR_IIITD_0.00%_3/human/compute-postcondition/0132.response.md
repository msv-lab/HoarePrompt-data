Output State: **`test_cases` is an empty list; `results` is a list containing the computed `res` values for each test case; `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, `res`, and `total_count` do not exist as they are local to each iteration of the loop.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `test_cases` will be an empty list because the loop processes each test case until there are none left. The `results` list will contain the computed values of `res` for each test case. The variables `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, `res`, and `total_count` will not exist in the global scope as they are local to each iteration of the loop and are not retained after their respective iterations complete.
