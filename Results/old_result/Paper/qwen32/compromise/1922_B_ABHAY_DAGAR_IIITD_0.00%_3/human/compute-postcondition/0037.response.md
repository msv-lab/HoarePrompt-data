The code snippet provided updates the variable `res` by adding the result of the expression `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to it. None of the other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, `total_count`, `cnt`) are directly modified by this code.

Given that `cnt` is a value obtained from `num_of_lens.values()`, the expression `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` calculates the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 3 at a time. This value is then added to `res`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is the previous `total_count` (before adding the previous `cnt`), `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is updated to include `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` added to its previous value.**
