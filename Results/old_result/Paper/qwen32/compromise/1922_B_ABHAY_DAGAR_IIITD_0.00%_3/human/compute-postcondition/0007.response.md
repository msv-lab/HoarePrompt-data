The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` by 1. Since `x` is a key that exists within `num_of_lens`, its value is incremented by 1. The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary, and `x` is a key that exists within `num_of_lens` with its value incremented by 1.**
