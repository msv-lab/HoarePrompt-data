Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple (n, a) such that n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and a is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The variable `results` has been initialized as an empty list. The initial state of `test_cases` remains unchanged.
