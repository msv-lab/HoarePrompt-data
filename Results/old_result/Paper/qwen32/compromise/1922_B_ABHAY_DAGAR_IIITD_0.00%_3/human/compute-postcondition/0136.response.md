Given the initial state, we have two variables: `test_cases` and `results`. 

- `test_cases` is an empty list.
- `results` is a list containing at least two computed `res` values.

The print statement is:
```python
print(result)
```
However, there is a typo in the variable name in the print statement. The variable `result` is not defined in the initial state. It seems like the intention was to print a value from the `results` list. Assuming the intention was to print the `results` list or one of its elements, we need to clarify which element of `results` is intended to be printed. Since the exact element is not specified, we can assume the intention might be to print the entire `results` list.

Given the information provided, the most precise description of what will be printed is the `results` list itself, as it is the only list with known contents.

Output: **results (where results is a list containing at least two computed `res` values)**
