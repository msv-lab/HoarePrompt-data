The value of `res` is updated by adding the result of the expression `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. Since `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, this expression calculates the number of combinations of `cnt` taken 3 at a time. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, `total_count` is 0, and the current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.**
