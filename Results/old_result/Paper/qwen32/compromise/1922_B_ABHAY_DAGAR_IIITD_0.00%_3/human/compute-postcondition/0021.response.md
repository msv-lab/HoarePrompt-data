The code snippet provided initializes `total_count` to 0. None of the other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, `res`) are affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `res` is 0, `total_count` is 0.**
