To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's break down the loop's behavior and the given initial state.

### Initial State:
- `results`: A list with `res` appended to it.
- `res`: 0.
- `test_cases`: Decremented by 1.
- `n`: An input integer.
- `num_list`: A list of integers obtained from the split input.
- `num_of_lens`: A dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of that integer in `num_list`.
- `total_count`: 0.

### Loop Behavior:
The loop iterates over the values of `num_of_lens` (which are the counts of each unique integer in `num_list`).

1. **If `cnt` (the current count) is >= 3**:
   - `res` is incremented by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.
2. **If `cnt` is >= 2**:
   - `res` is incremented by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.
3. **In every iteration**:
   - `total_count` is incremented by `cnt`.

### Output State After All Iterations:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, `total_count` will include the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`. The `res` variable will have been updated based on the conditions mentioned above for each count.

### Final Output State:
- `results` will contain the final value of `res` appended to it.
- `res` will be the sum of all the increments based on the counts in `num_of_lens`.
- `test_cases` will have been decremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same.
- `num_list` remains the same.
- `num_of_lens` remains the same.
- `total_count` will be the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`.

### Calculation:
Let's summarize the final state:
- `res` is the accumulated sum of all combinations calculated in the loop.
- `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.

### Final Output State in the Required Format:
Output State: **`results` is a list with the final `res` appended to it; `res` is the accumulated sum of all combinations calculated in the loop; `test_cases` is decremented by 1; `n` is unchanged; `num_list` is unchanged; `num_of_lens` is unchanged; `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is that `results` will have the final computed `res` value appended to it, which is the sum of all valid combinations of counts from `num_of_lens`, and other variables remain as per their initial state with `test_cases` decremented by 1.
