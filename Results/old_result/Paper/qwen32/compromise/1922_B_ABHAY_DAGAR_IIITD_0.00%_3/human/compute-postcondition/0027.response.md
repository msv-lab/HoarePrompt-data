The code snippet `res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` modifies the value of `res` by adding the result of the expression `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is 0, `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, and `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.**

Since `total_count` is 0, the expression `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` evaluates to 0, and thus `res` remains unchanged. However, the state reflects the potential update to `res` as per the code snippet.
