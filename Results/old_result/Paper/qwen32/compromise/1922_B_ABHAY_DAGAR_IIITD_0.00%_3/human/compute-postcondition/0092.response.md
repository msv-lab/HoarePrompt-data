The only variable in the loop head is `x`, which iterates over `num_list`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, the state of `num_list` is the only one that needs to be adjusted. If `num_list` contains at least one element, the loop will execute.

Given the provided state before the loop starts:
- `results` is a list with `res` appended to it.
- `res` holds its original value.
- `test_cases` is decremented by 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the split input.
- `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary.

The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `num_list` has at least one element for the loop to execute.

State: **`results` is a list with `res` appended to it, `res` holds its original value, `test_cases` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary**.
