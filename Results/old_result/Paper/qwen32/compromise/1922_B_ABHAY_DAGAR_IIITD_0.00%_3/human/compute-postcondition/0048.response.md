The code snippet provided resets the `num_of_lens` dictionary to an empty dictionary. This action does not affect the values of `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, `res`, or `total_count`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is the input integer, `num_list` is the list of integers obtained from the input, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is updated to the final accumulated value after all iterations, `total_count` is updated to the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.**
