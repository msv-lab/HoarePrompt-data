The code snippet calculates the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the list `elements` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The values of `removals` and the condition that `removals` is not 6 and `negatives` is 3 remain unchanged. The variable `pos` remains an empty list, and `s` remains the sum of all elements in `elements`.

Output State: **removals and negatives are non-negative integers such that 0 <= removals <= len(elements) and 0 <= negatives <= len(elements). elements is a list of integers. It is not the case that removals is 6 and negatives is 3. pos is an empty list. s is the sum of elements. n is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`.**
