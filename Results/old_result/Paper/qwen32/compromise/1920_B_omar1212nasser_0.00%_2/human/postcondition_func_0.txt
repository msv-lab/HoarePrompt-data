The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, `x`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it sorts the list `a` and computes a product using the values of `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a`, which is then printed. The function does not modify the original list `a` outside of sorting it within each test case.
