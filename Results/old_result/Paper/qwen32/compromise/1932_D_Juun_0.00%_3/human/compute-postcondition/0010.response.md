The only variable in the loop head is `trumps`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `trumps`. If `trumps` is not an empty list, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `trumps` is an empty list, so it needs to be adjusted to contain at least one element.

State: **`trumps` is a non-empty list, `answers` is a list of sorted pairs of non-trump cards of the same suit and appended strings of unpaired non-trump cards with trump cards, `suits` is a dictionary with suits having either None or the rank of an unpaired non-trump card.**
