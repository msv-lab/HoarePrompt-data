Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels with the given constraints. The program attempts to determine if it's possible to make `n` equal to `k` through a series of operations, but it does not actually simulate the process of Alice buying jewels from stalls with specific prices.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
1. The function starts by checking if `n` is equal to `k`. If so, it prints "YES", sets up one stall with a price of 1, and returns. This is correct for this specific case.
2. If `n` is less than `k`, it correctly prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels if she has fewer coins than the number of jewels.
3. For the remaining cases, the program initializes `costs` with two values `[n - k + 1, 1]` and then tries to calculate how many jewels Alice can buy from these stalls. However, this approach is incorrect:
   - It does not guarantee that the total number of jewels bought will equal `k`.
   - It does not ensure that the number of stalls is at most 60.
   - It does not simulate the greedy behavior of Alice buying as many jewels as possible from each stall in sequence.

A correct approach would involve setting up a series of stalls with prices that allow Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels. One way to achieve this is by using a binary representation of `k` to determine the prices of the stalls. For example, if `k` is 8, you could set up stalls with prices that allow Alice to buy 1 jewel from each of 8 stalls, each with a price that fits within her budget.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
