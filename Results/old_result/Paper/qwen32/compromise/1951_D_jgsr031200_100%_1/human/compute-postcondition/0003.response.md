The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state describes variables `n` and `k`, both of which are positive integers and are equal to each other. However, the `print` statement does not reference these variables in any way; it simply prints the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of `n` and `k`.

Output: **1**
