Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two positive integer parameters `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}). It prints "YES" and additional information if it's possible to make `n` equal to `k` through a series of operations, otherwise it prints "NO". The function does not return any value.**
