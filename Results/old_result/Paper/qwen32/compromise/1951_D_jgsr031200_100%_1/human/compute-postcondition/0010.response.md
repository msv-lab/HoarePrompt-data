Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k; costs is [n - k + 1, 1]**

Natural language: The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as positive integers with the conditions 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k. A new list `costs` is created with the values `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
