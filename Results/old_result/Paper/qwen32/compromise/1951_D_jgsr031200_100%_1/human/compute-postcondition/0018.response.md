In the given initial state, we have the following information:

- `n` is 0.
- `k` is `k` (which means `k` is a variable but its exact value is not provided).
- `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`, which simplifies to `[-k + 1, 1]` because `n` is 0.
- `h` is calculated as `n // (n - k + 1) + k - 1`, which simplifies to `0 // (-k + 1) + k - 1 = k - 1` because `n` is 0.
- It is also mentioned that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, but based on the calculation, `h` is `k - 1`, which contradicts this condition unless `k` is less than or equal to 1. However, this detail is not necessary for determining the output of the `print` statement.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(2)
```

This statement simply prints the integer `2`, regardless of the values of the variables `n`, `k`, `costs`, or `h`.

Output: **2**
