Precondition: **Each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the n × n matrix filled with zeroes. The function should handle multiple test cases, where the total number of test cases t is between 1 and 500, and the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5.**
