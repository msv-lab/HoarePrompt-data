### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its output in the context of the problem statement.

#### Objective:
The objective is to maximize the sum of all elements in an `n × n` matrix using no more than `2n` operations. The operations allowed are:
1. **Type 1 Operation**: Choose a row `i` and fill it with a permutation of numbers from `1` to `n`.
2. **Type 2 Operation**: Choose a column `i` and fill it with a permutation of numbers from `1` to `n`.

#### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum in a peculiar manner using a loop that iterates from `1` to `n`.
   - For each `i` in this range, it checks if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. If true, it adds `n * (n + 1) // 2` to the sum and sets `r` to `i`. Otherwise, it adds `i * n` to the sum.
   - The sum is calculated based on this conditional logic, but it does not directly reflect the maximum possible sum of the matrix.

2. **Operations Generation**:
   - The program then generates `n + r` operations.
   - For the first `n` operations, it fills each row with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` (Type 1 operations).
   - For the remaining `r` operations, it fills each column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` (Type 2 operations).

#### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Sum Calculation**:
  - The sum calculation does not correctly compute the maximum possible sum of the matrix.
  - The maximum sum for an `n × n` matrix where each row and each column is filled with a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]` is `n * n * (n + 1) / 2`. This is because each row and each column can independently have the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, and there are `n` rows and `n` columns.
  - The program's conditional logic does not reflect this maximum sum.

- **Incorrect Number of Operations**:
  - The number of operations `n + r` is not necessarily the optimal number of operations to achieve the maximum sum.
  - The program's logic for determining `r` is based on a condition that does not align with the problem's requirements.

#### Correct Approach:
- The maximum sum can be achieved by filling each row (or each column) with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This results in a sum of `n * n * (n + 1) / 2` and requires exactly `n` operations (either all Type 1 or all Type 2).

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the sum calculation and the number of operations, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program's output does not reflect the maximum possible sum for the matrix, and the operations generated do not align with the optimal solution.

**Correctness: False**
