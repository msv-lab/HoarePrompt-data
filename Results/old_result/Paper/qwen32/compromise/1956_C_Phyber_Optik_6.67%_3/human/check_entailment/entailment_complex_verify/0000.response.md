### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to maximize the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix \( a \) using Type 1 and Type 2 operations.
- **Type 1 operation**: Assign a row \( i \) with a permutation of \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
- **Type 2 operation**: Assign a column \( j \) with a permutation of \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
- The maximum sum is \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), which can be achieved by filling each row and each column with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum using a loop that checks if \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 > i \times n \).
   - If true, it adds \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \) to the sum and sets \( r = i \).
   - Otherwise, it adds \( i \times n \) to the sum.
   - This approach is incorrect as it does not maximize the sum. The correct sum should be \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).

2. **Number of Operations**:
   - The program calculates the number of operations as \( n + r \).
   - This is not necessarily the correct number of operations to achieve the maximum sum.
   - The correct approach is to perform \( 2n \) operations: \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations.

3. **Operations**:
   - For \( j \leq n \), it prints a Type 1 operation for each row.
   - For \( j > n \), it prints a Type 2 operation, but the column index is incorrectly calculated as \( j \% n \), which can be zero.

#### Correct Approach:
- **Sum**: The maximum sum is \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
- **Operations**: Perform \( n \) Type 1 operations to fill each row and \( n \) Type 2 operations to fill each column.

#### Correct Code Example:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)
        print(max_sum, 2 * n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, *range(1, n + 1))
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(2, j, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The given program does not correctly compute the maximum sum or provide the correct sequence of operations to achieve that sum. The logic for calculating the sum and the operations is flawed.

#### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
