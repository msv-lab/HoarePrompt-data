The code snippet `sum += n * (n + 1) // 2` increases the value of `sum` by `n * (n + 1) // 2`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `j`, `i`, `r`) remain unchanged based on the given initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n + r + 1`, `i` is `n`, `r` is `i`, `sum` is the previous value of `sum` plus `n * (n + 1) // 2`.**
