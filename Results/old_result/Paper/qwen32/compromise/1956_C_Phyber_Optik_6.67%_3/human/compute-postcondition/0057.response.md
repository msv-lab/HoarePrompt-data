The code snippet provided is `sum += i * n`. This line increments the value of `sum` by the product of `i` and `n`. The values of `t`, `n`, `j`, `r`, and `i` remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this line, which they are not.

Given the initial state, the value of `sum` was either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `(i + 1) * n` depending on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > (i + 1) * n`. After executing the line `sum += i * n`, the new value of `sum` will be the previous value of `sum` plus `i * n`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1`. If `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `(i + 1) * n`, then `r` is `i + 1` and `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + i * n`. Otherwise, `r` is 0 and `sum` is `(i + 1) * n + i * n`, `i` is `i + 1`.**
