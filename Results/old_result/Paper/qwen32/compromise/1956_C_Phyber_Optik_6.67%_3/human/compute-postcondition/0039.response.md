Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1.
2. `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1.
3. `r` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`.
4. `sum` is mentioned but not explicitly used in the print statement.
5. `j` is mentioned to be `j + 1` and is less than `n + r + 1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement prints all integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
- The `*` operator unpacks the range object, so the numbers are printed separated by spaces.
- The value of `t` and `r` are not relevant to this print statement.
- The value of `sum` is not used in the print statement.
- The value of `j` is not used in the print statement.

### Output:
The output will be a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`, separated by spaces.

### Final Answer:
Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the integer greater than or equal to 1)**

This output represents the sequence of numbers from 1 up to `n`, inclusive, with each number separated by a space.
