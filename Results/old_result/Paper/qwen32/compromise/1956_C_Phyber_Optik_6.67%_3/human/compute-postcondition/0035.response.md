Let's break down the given problem step by step using the provided initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1.
- `r` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `sum` is a variable whose computation is not explicitly described in the initial state.
- `j` is mentioned to be incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `n + r`, but it is not directly used in the `print` statement.

### The Print Statement:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement uses the unpacking operator `*` to print all elements of the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) separated by spaces.

- `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
- The unpacking operator `*` ensures that each number in this sequence is printed as a separate argument to the `print` function, resulting in a space-separated list of numbers.

### Output:
The output will be a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`, each separated by a space.

### Final Answer:
Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the integer provided in the initial state and is greater than or equal to 1)**
