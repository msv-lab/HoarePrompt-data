Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `r` is the largest `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true and ensures `n + r + 1` is at least 2.
- `sum` is the cumulative sum as defined (though it's not used in the print statement).
- `j` is `n + r + 1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) separated by spaces.
- The value of `n` is a non-negative integer, but its exact value is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of `n`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is a non-negative integer)**

If `n` were provided with a specific value, we could list the exact numbers. Since `n` is not specified, we describe the output in terms of `n`.
