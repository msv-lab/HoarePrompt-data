Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to understand what will be printed.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer input.
   - `r` is the last `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true and is non-negative.
   - `sum` is the total accumulated sum based on a condition.
   - `j` is `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1` and is greater than `n`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - `print(*range(1, n + 1))`

The print statement uses the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and then unpacks this sequence using the `*` operator to print each number separated by a space.

Given the initial state, the key variable for the print statement is `n`. The values of `t`, `r`, `sum`, and `j` are not directly relevant to the output of this specific print statement.

### Explanation:
- `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
- The `*` operator unpacks this sequence, meaning each number in the sequence will be printed on the same line, separated by spaces.

### Example:
If `n` is 5, then `range(1, n + 1)` will generate the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, and the print statement will output:
```
1 2 3 4 5
```

### Output Description:
The output will be a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`, each separated by a space.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the non-negative integer input)**
