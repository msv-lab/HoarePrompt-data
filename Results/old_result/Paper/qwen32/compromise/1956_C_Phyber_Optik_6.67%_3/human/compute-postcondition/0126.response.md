To determine what will be printed by the `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement, let's break down the given initial state and understand the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1.
2. **`n`**: A non-negative integer.
3. **`r`**: The largest `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true, and it ensures `n + r + 1` is at least 2.
4. **`sum`**: A cumulative sum (not explicitly used in the print statement, so we can ignore this for now).
5. **`j`**: Defined as `n + r + 1`.

### Focus on the Print Statement:
The print statement in question is:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n + 1`.
- The `*` operator is used to unpack the range object so that each number in the sequence is printed as a separate argument to the `print` function.

### Output:
Given that `n` is a non-negative integer, the `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print all integers from 1 up to `n`.

### Example Scenarios:
- If `n` is 0, `range(1, 0 + 1)` generates no numbers, so the output will be an empty line.
- If `n` is 1, `range(1, 1 + 1)` generates the number 1, so the output will be: `1`.
- If `n` is 5, `range(1, 5 + 1)` generates the numbers 1 through 5, so the output will be: `1 2 3 4 5`.

### Final Output Description:
The output will be a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to `n`, separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is a non-negative integer)**
