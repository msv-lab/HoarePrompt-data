Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is a non-negative integer input, `r` is the last `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true and is non-negative, `sum` is the total accumulated sum based on the condition, and `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, ensuring `1 <= j <= n + r`. The program does not modify any variables in the else part, so the state remains the same as described in the precondition.**
