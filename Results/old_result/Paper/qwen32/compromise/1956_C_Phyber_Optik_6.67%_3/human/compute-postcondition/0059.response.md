The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. Specifically, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 again, so that `i` is still less than `n + 1`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1`, `i` is `i + 2`. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > (i + 1) * n`, then `r` is `i + 1` and `sum` is either `2 * (n * (n + 1) // 2)` or `((i + 1) + 1) * n + n * (n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > ((i + 1) + 1) * n`, then `r` is `i + 2` and `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + (i + 1) * n`. If neither condition is true, then `r` is 0 and `sum` is `((i + 1) + 1) * n + (i + 1) * n`.**

However, focusing only on the loop head variable `i`:

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`.**
