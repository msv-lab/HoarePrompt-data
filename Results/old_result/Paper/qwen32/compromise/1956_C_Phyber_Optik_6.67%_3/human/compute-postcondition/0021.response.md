To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how the variables `sum` and `r` are updated based on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.

The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. For each iteration:
- If the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, `r` is set to `i` and `sum` is incremented by `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
- Otherwise, `sum` is incremented by `i * n`.

Let's break down the logic:
- `n * (n + 1) // 2` computes the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
- The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` simplifies to `(n + 1) // 2 > i` when `n` is even and `(n + 1) / 2 > i` when `n` is odd. This means the condition is true for `i` values up to `(n + 1) // 2`.

Therefore, for `i` from `1` to `(n + 1) // 2`, `r` will be updated to `i` and `sum` will be incremented by `n * (n + 1) // 2`. For `i` from `((n + 1) // 2) + 1` to `n`, `sum` will be incremented by `i * n`.

Let's calculate the final values of `sum` and `r`:
- `r` will be the last value of `i` for which the condition was true, i.e., `r = (n + 1) // 2`.
- `sum` will be the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for the first `(n + 1) // 2` iterations and `i * n` for the remaining iterations.

The final `sum` can be calculated as:
\[ \text{sum} = \left(\frac{n + 1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2}\right) + \sum_{i = \left(\frac{n + 1}{2}\right) + 1}^{n} (i \times n) \]

Simplifying the second part of the sum:
\[ \sum_{i = \left(\frac{n + 1}{2}\right) + 1}^{n} (i \times n) = n \times \left(\sum_{i = \left(\frac{n + 1}{2}\right) + 1}^{n} i\right) \]
\[ = n \times \left(\sum_{i = 1}^{n} i - \sum_{i = 1}^{\left(\frac{n + 1}{2}\right)} i\right) \]
\[ = n \times \left(\frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} - \frac{\left(\frac{n + 1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{n + 3}{2}\right)}{2}\right) \]

Combining both parts, we get the final `sum`.

However, for simplicity and to follow the format, let's compute the final state directly:

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1; `r` is `(n + 1) // 2`; `sum` is the computed sum as described above.**

In natural language: After all iterations, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `r` is the integer part of `(n + 1) / 2`, and `sum` is the total accumulated value based on the loop's logic.
