The code snippet `r = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `r`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. Since `i` is already defined as `i + 1` in the initial state, we do not need to modify this value further.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `i + 1`.**
