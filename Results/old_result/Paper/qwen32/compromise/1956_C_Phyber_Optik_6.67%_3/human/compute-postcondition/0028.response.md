To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state and analyze the variables involved:

1. **Variable `t`**: It is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1. However, this variable is not used in the print statement, so its value does not affect the output.

2. **Variable `n`**: It is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1. This variable is used in the calculation of `r` and in the print statement.

3. **Variable `r`**: It is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`. This value is not used in the print statement, so its calculation does not affect the output.

4. **Variable `sum`**: The sum is computed as described, but it is not used in the print statement, so its value does not affect the output.

5. **Variable `j`**: It is an integer and is greater than `n`. This variable is used in the print statement to calculate `j % n`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

Let's analyze the output step-by-step:

- The first value to be printed is the integer `2`.
- The second value to be printed is `j % n`. Since `j` is greater than `n`, `j % n` will be the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`. The exact value of `j % n` depends on the specific values of `j` and `n`, but we can describe it as `j % n` where `j` is an integer greater than `n`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2, j % n (where j is an integer greater than n)**
