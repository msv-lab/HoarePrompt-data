Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1; `r` is `(n + 1) // 2`; `sum` is the computed sum as described above; `j` is `j + 1` and is less than or equal to `n + r`. The value of `j` is incremented by 1 regardless of whether `j` was initially less than or equal to `n` or not.**
