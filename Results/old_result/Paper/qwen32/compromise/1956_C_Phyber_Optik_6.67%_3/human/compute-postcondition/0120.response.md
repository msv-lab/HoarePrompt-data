Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1.
2. `n` is a non-negative integer.
3. `r` is the largest `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true and ensures `n + r + 1` is at least 2.
4. `sum` is the cumulative sum as defined (though it is not directly used in the print statement).
5. `j` is `n + r`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement uses the `range(1, n + 1)` function.
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- The `*` operator unpacks the sequence generated by `range(1, n + 1)` and passes each element as a separate argument to the `print` function, resulting in the numbers being printed on the same line separated by spaces.

### Output:
The output will be a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

### Final Answer:
Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is a non-negative integer)**

This output is based on the precondition that `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is 0, the output will be an empty line since the range will be empty. For any positive `n`, the output will be the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.
