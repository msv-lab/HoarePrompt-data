Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `r` is the largest `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true and ensures `n + r + 1` is at least 2.
   - `sum` is the cumulative sum as defined (though it is not used in the print statement).
   - `j` is `n + r + 1`, and `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Conditions and Calculations:**
   - The condition `j <= n` implies `n + r + 1 <= n`. Simplifying this, we get `r + 1 <= 0` or `r <= -1`.
   - However, `r` is defined as the largest `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true. For `r` to be a valid integer, it must be non-negative because it is the largest `i` satisfying this inequality.
   - Given that `r` must be non-negative and `r <= -1` cannot hold, there seems to be an inconsistency in the problem statement as defined. However, we will proceed by assuming the condition `j <= n` is meant to be `j >= n` or some other consistent condition, but based on the provided information, we must work with the given constraints.

3. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print(1, j, end=' ')`.
   - `1` is a constant and will be printed as is.
   - `j` is `n + r + 1`. Given `r` must be non-negative and `j <= n`, the only way this can hold true is if `r = -1`, but this contradicts `r` being non-negative. Therefore, we need to consider the constraints carefully.
   - If we assume the problem intends for `j` to be calculated correctly based on `r` being the largest valid `i`, and `j` being consistent with `n`, the only way to satisfy `j <= n` with `r` non-negative is if `r = 0` and `n = 1` (as an example).

4. **Example Calculation:**
   - Let's assume `n = 1` for simplicity.
   - The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` becomes `1 * 2 // 2 > i * 1` or `1 > i`. The largest `i` satisfying this is `i = 0`. Thus, `r = 0`.
   - Then, `j = n + r + 1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`. But `j <= n` implies `2 <= 1`, which is false. Therefore, we need to adjust our assumptions.
   - If we assume `n = 1` and `r = 0` but `j` should be `1` to satisfy `j <= n`, then `j = 1`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the constraints and the need to satisfy `j <= n` with `r` non-negative, the only consistent solution is if `n = 1`, `r = 0`, and `j = 1`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **1, 1**
