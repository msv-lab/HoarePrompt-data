The code snippet `sum += n * (n + 1) // 2` modifies the value of `sum` by adding the result of `n * (n + 1) // 2` to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Given that `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, the expression `n * (n + 1) // 2` calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. The value of `sum` is updated to reflect this addition.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `r` is equal to `i + 1`; `sum` is updated to `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2`.**
