The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads a new integer value from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This new value of `n` will replace the previous value of `n`. The other variables (`t`, `r`, `sum`, and `j`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the new non-negative integer input, `r` is the last `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true and is non-negative, `sum` is the total accumulated sum based on the condition, and `j` is `n + r + 1`.**
