The code snippet `sum += n * (n + 1) // 2` adds the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2` to the current value of `sum`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0.
- `n` is at least 1.
- `j` is `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1`.
- `r` is `i`.
- `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `(i + 1) * n` based on the initial condition.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

After executing the code snippet, `sum` will be updated to its current value plus `n * (n + 1) // 2`. Therefore, the new value of `sum` will be:
- If `sum` was initially `n * (n + 1) // 2`, it will now be `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2 = 2 * (n * (n + 1) // 2)`.
- If `sum` was initially `(i + 1) * n`, it will now be `(i + 1) * n + n * (n + 1) // 2`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `j`, `r`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1`, `r` is `i`, `sum` is either `2 * (n * (n + 1) // 2)` or `(i + 1) * n + n * (n + 1) // 2`, `i` is `i + 1`.**
