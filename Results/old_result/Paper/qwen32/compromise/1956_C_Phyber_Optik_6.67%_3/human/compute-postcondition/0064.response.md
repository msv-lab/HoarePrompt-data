To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables `r` and `sum` are updated.

The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. Let's break down the logic inside the loop:

1. The condition `if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` checks if the sum of the first `n` natural numbers is greater than `i * n`.
2. If the condition is true, `r` is set to `i` and `sum` is incremented by `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
3. If the condition is false, `sum` is incremented by `i * n`.

Since `n * (n + 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, it is a constant for a given `n`. The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` will be true for smaller values of `i` and false for larger values of `i`.

Let's analyze the loop in detail:

- For `i = 1`: `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 1 * n` is true if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > n`, which is always true for `n > 1`. So, `r` becomes `1` and `sum` becomes `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
- For `i = 2`: `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n` might be true or false depending on `n`.
- For `i = 3`: `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 3 * n` might be true or false depending on `n`.
- This continues until `i = n`.

The value of `r` will be the last `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true. The `sum` will be the cumulative sum of either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` depending on the condition.

After the loop completes all iterations, the final state of `r` will be the last `i` for which the condition was true, and `sum` will be the cumulative sum as described.

Let's calculate the final state:

- `r` will be the largest `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
- `sum` will be the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where the condition is true, and `i * n` for all `i` where the condition is false.

The final `sum` can be calculated as follows:
- If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` for `i = 1` to `k`, then `sum` will be `k * (n * (n + 1) // 2) + sum(i * n for i = k + 1 to n)`.

The exact value of `r` and `sum` can be derived from the above logic, but the general form of the final state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the new integer input, `r` is the last `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, `sum` is the cumulative sum as described, and `j` is `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `r` will be the last index where the sum of the first `n` natural numbers is greater than `i * n`, and `sum` will be the total accumulated sum based on the condition. The variable `j` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the new integer input, `r` is the last `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, `sum` is the total accumulated sum based on the condition, and `j` is `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1`.**
