To determine the state needed for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `j` and `n + r + 1`.

The loop will execute if the range `(1, n + r + 1)` contains at least one integer. This means `n + r + 1` must be greater than 1, or equivalently, `n + r` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0.
- `n` is the new integer input.
- `r` is the last `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true.
- `sum` is the total accumulated sum based on the condition.
- `j` is `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1`.

From the loop head, the key variable to adjust is `n + r + 1` to ensure the loop can execute. We need to ensure that `n + r` is at least 0 so that `n + r + 1` is greater than 1.

Let's analyze `r`:
- `r` is defined as the last `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true. If `n` is 0, then `n * (n + 1) // 2` is 0, and the condition `0 > i * 0` is never true, so `r` would be -1 (if we consider the last `i` for which the condition is true is -1 when `n` is 0). However, since `n` is the new integer input and typically we consider `n` to be non-negative, `r` should be at least 0 when `n` is greater than 0.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes:
- We need `n + r` to be at least 0. Given `r` is non-negative when `n` is non-negative, this condition is generally satisfied.

However, to be explicit:
- If `n` is 0, `r` should be adjusted to be 0 to ensure `n + r` is 0, and `n + r + 1` is 1, making the loop execute at least once.
- If `n` is greater than 0, `r` should naturally be non-negative, and `n + r` should be positive.

Thus, the state should be adjusted to ensure `n + r` is at least 0, which is naturally satisfied if `n` is non-negative and `r` is non-negative.

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is a non-negative integer input, `r` is the last `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true and is non-negative, `sum` is the total accumulated sum based on the condition, `j` is `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1`**
