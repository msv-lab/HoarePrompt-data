The code snippet `sum += n * (n + 1) // 2` updates the value of `sum` by adding the result of `n * (n + 1) // 2` to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged. 

The expression `n * (n + 1) // 2` calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. Therefore, `sum` is incremented by this value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `r` is `i + 1`; `sum` is updated by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` to it.**
