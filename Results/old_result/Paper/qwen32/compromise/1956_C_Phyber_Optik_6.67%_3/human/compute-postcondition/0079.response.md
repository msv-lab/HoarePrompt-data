Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is a non-negative integer input, `r` is the last `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true and is non-negative, `sum` is the total accumulated sum based on the condition, and `j` is `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 2`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the conditions on `t`, `n`, `r`, `sum`, and `j` remain as specified. If `j` is greater than `n` but less than or equal to `n + r`, the conditions on `t`, `n`, `r`, `sum`, and `j` remain as specified. Otherwise, `j` is greater than `n + r` and the loop terminates.**

This postcondition summarizes the behavior of the program fragment, detailing the conditions under which the variables `t`, `n`, `r`, `sum`, and `j` remain unchanged or when the loop terminates.
