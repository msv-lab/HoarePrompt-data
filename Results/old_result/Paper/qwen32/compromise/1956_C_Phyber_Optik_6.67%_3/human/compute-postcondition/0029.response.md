The given code snippet is:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1.
- `r` is `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `sum` is the computed sum as described above.
- `j` is greater than `n`.

However, the value of `sum` and `j` are not used in the provided code snippet. The only variable from the initial state that is directly used in the `print` statement is `n`.

The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. The `*` operator is used to unpack the range object into separate arguments for the `print` function, so the output will be a space-separated list of numbers from 1 to `n`.

Therefore, the output will be the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 1)**
