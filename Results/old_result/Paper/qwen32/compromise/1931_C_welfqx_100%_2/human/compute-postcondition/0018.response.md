To determine the final output state after the loop executes all its iterations, let's analyze the loop and its effects on the variables involved.

The loop iterates over the range `n - 1` times, comparing each pair of consecutive elements in the list `num`. If any pair of consecutive elements are not equal, the variable `f` is set to 0 and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `f` remains 1.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop has not yet broken out of the loop (i.e., `f` is still 1) and `n` is at least 4 (since the loop has executed 3 times).

After all iterations are completed:
- If any pair of consecutive elements in `num` were not equal, `f` would have been set to 0 and the loop would have broken.
- If all pairs of consecutive elements in `num` were equal, `f` would remain 1.

The loop will execute `n - 1` times, so the final state of `j` will be `n - 2` (since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration).

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `f` is 0 if any `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` for any `j` in the range `0` to `n - 2`, otherwise `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `j` is `n - 2`.**

In simpler terms: After the loop completes, `f` will be 0 if there are any two consecutive different numbers in the list `num`; otherwise, `f` will remain 1. The value of `j` will be `n - 2`, and the other variables (`t` and `num`) will remain unchanged from their initial states.
