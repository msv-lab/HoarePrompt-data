The code snippet provided is `onum.reverse()`, which reverses the list `onum` in-place. This means that the original order of elements in `onum` is reversed, but all other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the input integer
- `f` is 0 if any two consecutive elements in `num` are not equal, otherwise `f` is 1
- `num` is the new input list of integers
- `onum` is a copy of the input list `num`
- `symb1` is the first element of the input list
- `symb2` is the first element of the input list
- `ck` depends on the conditions provided for `symb1` and `symb2`
- `r` is `r + 1` if the loop breaks due to `num[j]` not equal to `num[j + 1]`
- If `n` equals 1 or `f` equals 1, then the conditions specified for `f`, `num`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `ck`, and `r` are maintained as described

After executing `onum.reverse()`, the list `onum` will be the reverse of its original order, while all other variables will remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `f` is 0 if any two consecutive elements in `num` are not equal, otherwise `f` is 1; `num` is the new input list of integers; `onum` is the reversed copy of the input list `num`; `symb1` is the first element of the input list; `symb2` is the first element of the input list; `ck` depends on the conditions provided for `symb1` and `symb2`; `r` is `r + 1` if the loop breaks due to `num[j]` not equal to `num[j + 1]`.**
