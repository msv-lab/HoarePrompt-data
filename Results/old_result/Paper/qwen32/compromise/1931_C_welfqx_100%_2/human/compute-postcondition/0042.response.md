Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `ck` is 1, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables remain unchanged, but we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
