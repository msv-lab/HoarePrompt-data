Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    f = 1
    num = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]
    for j in range(n - 1):
        if num[j] != num[j + 1]:
            f = 0
            break
    if n == 1 or f == 1:
        print(0)
        continue
    onum = num.copy()
    onum.reverse()
    cn = 1
    ck = 1
    f = 1
    symb1 = num[0]
    symb2 = onum[0]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if num[i] == num[i + 1]:
            cn += 1
        else:
            break
    for ii in range(n - 1):
        if onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]:
            ck += 1
        else:
            break
    if symb1 == symb2:
        cn += ck
    print(n - max(cn, ck))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of `num` and moving towards the first element until a different element is encountered or the start of the list is reached. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is the sum of its previous value and `ck`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `f` is 1, `num` is the input list of integers, `onum` is the input list of integers, `symb1` is the first element of the input list, and `symb2` is the first element of the input list. If `symb1` equals `symb2`, then `ck` is the number of consecutive equal elements found before the loop breaks or `n` if all elements in `onum` are equal, plus the number of consecutive equal elements found before the loop breaks or `n` if all elements in `num` are equal. If `symb1` does not equal `symb2`, `ck` remains unchanged as the number of consecutive equal elements found before the loop breaks or `n` if all elements in `onum` are equal. `r` is `r_prev + 1` if `n` equals 1 or `f` equals 1, and `j` is `n - 2` if all elements in `num` are equal, otherwise `j` is the value of `i` when the loop breaks.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `f` is 1; `num` is the new input list of integers; `onum` is the reversed copy of the input list `num`; `symb1` is the first element of the input list; `symb2` is the last element of the input list; if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, then `cn` is `n + ck`; otherwise, `cn` remains `n`. `r` is `r + 1` if the loop breaks due to `num[j]` not equal to `num[j + 1]`; `ii` is the index where the loop broke or `n - 2` if the loop completes all iterations; `ck` is the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of `num`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
