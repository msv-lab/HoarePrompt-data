The code snippet provided is `cn += ck`. This line of code adds the value of `ck` to the current value of `cn`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1.
- `f` is 1.
- `num` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `j` is `n - 2`.
- `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`.
- `symb1` is the first element of `num`.
- `symb2` is the last element of `num`.
- `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of `num` and moving towards the first element until a different element is encountered or the start of the list is reached.
- `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`.
- Additionally, `symb1` is equal to `symb2`.

After executing `cn += ck`, the value of `cn` will be updated to the sum of its previous value and the value of `ck`. No other variables are affected.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of `num` and moving towards the first element until a different element is encountered or the start of the list is reached, `cn` is the sum of its previous value and `ck`. Additionally, `symb1` is equal to `symb2`.**
