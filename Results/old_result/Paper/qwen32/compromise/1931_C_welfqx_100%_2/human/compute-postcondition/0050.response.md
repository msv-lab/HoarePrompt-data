Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `ck` is 1, and `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`. The elements at index `ii` and `ii + 1` in `onum` are not equal, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of all the variables remain unchanged. The code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but no other changes occur to the variables.
