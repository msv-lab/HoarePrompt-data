The code snippet `cn += 1` increments the value of `cn` by 1. The initial state does not specify the value of `cn`, so we can only say that its value is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `ck` is 1, `i` is 0, `cn` is increased by 1.**
