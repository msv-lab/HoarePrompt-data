Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, and `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`. `ii` is incremented by 1. If `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, `ck` is incremented by 1. If `onum[ii]` is not equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
