Postcondition: **t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is the input integer; f is 1; num is the new input list of integers; onum is the reversed copy of the input list num; symb1 is the first element of the input list; symb2 is the last element of the input list; symb1 is equal to symb2; r is r + 1 if the loop breaks due to num[j] not equal to num[j + 1]; cn is n; ii is the index where the loop broke or n - 2 if the loop completes all iterations; ck is the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of num.**
