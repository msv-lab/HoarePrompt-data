Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `onum` is now the same as the new `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the new `num`, `symb2` is the first element of the new `num`, `ck` is 1, `r` is `r_prev + 1` if `n` equals 1 or `f` equals 1, and if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `j` remains `n - 2` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise `j` is the value of `j` when the loop breaks. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, `cn` is set to 2. If `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]`, `cn` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, `cn` is incremented by 1. If `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of without changing `cn`.**
