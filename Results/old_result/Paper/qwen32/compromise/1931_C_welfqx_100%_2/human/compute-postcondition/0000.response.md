Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of an integer input, which is expected to be within the range of 1 to 10^4. The other variables (`n` and `a`) and their conditions remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
