Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `f` is 0, `num` is a new input list of integers, `onum` is the input list of integers, `symb1` is the first element of the input list, `symb2` is the first element of the input list, `ck` depends on the conditions provided for `symb1` and `symb2`, `r` is `r + 1`, and `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `f` has been changed to 0. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions as described in the initial state.
