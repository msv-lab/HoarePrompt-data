Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `ck` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `cn` is `cn + 1`.**

In simple terms, the variable `cn` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their initial values.
