Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 0, `num` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of the new `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the new `num`, `symb2` is the last element of the new `num`, `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of the new `num` and moving towards the first element until a different element is encountered or the start of the list is reached, if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is the sum of its previous value and `ck`, `r` is `r_prev + 1`, and `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`.**

Explanation: The variable `f` has been changed from 1 to 0. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
