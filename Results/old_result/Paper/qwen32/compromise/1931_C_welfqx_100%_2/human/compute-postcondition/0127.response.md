To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **`n`**: An integer input greater than or equal to 2.
3. **`f`**: An integer initialized to 1.
4. **`num`**: An input list of integers.
5. **`onum`**: Another input list of integers.
6. **`symb1`**: The first element of the `onum` list.
7. **`symb2`**: The first element of the `num` list.
8. **`ck`**: Calculated based on the conditions involving `symb1`, `symb2`, and the elements in `onum` and `num`.
9. **`r`**: Calculated based on the conditions involving `n` and `f`.
10. **`j`**: Calculated based on the conditions involving the elements in `num`.

### Key Points:
- **`ck`** is calculated differently depending on whether `symb1` equals `symb2`:
  - If `symb1` equals `symb2`, `ck` is the sum of the number of consecutive equal elements found in both `onum` and `num`, or `n` if all elements in either list are equal.
  - If `symb1` does not equal `symb2`, `ck` is the number of consecutive equal elements found in `onum`, or `n` if all elements in `onum` are equal.
- **`cn`**: This variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we need to assume it is defined elsewhere in the code and is relevant to the calculation.
- **`r` and `j`**: These are calculated based on conditions involving `n` and `f`, but they are not directly used in the `print` statement.

### The Print Statement:
```python
print(n - max(cn, ck))
```
- **`n`**: The integer input greater than or equal to 2.
- **`max(cn, ck)`**: The maximum value between `cn` and `ck`.

### Analyzing the Output:
- The output will be the value of `n` minus the maximum value between `cn` and `ck`.
- Since `cn` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can only describe it in terms of the problem's context.

### Conclusion:
The output of the print statement will be `n` minus the maximum of `cn` and `ck`. The exact numerical value of `cn` is not provided, so we describe it in terms of the problem's context.

Output: **n - max(cn, ck) (where cn is the number of consecutive equal elements found in num, or n if all elements in num are equal, and ck is the number of consecutive equal elements found in onum, or n if all elements in onum are equal, plus the number of consecutive equal elements found in num if symb1 equals symb2)**
