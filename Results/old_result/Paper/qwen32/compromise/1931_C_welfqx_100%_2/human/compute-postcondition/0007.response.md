The variable `f` is assigned the value `0`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `j` is not specified before the loop starts, and `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`.**
