Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `f` is 0 if any `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` for any `j` in the range `0` to `n - 2`, otherwise `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `j` is `n - 2`. The condition `n == 1 or f == 1` is true.**
