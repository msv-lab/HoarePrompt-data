Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `num` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `j` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `f` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `num`, `j`, and `f` remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that it exits the most internal loop or if statement.
