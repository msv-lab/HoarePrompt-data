The given code snippet updates the `num` list by reading a new list of integers from the input. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `f` is 1, `num` is the new input list of integers, `onum` is the input list of integers, `symb1` is the first element of the input list, `symb2` is the first element of the input list, `ck` depends on the conditions provided for `symb1` and `symb2`, `r` is `r + 1`, `j` is determined based on the conditions provided for the elements in `num`.**
