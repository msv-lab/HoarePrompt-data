Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer and must be at least 2; `f` is 1; `num` is the new input list of integers; `onum` is the reversed copy of the input list `num`; `symb1` is the first element of the input list; `symb2` is the last element of the input list; `r` is `r + 1` if the loop breaks due to `num[j]` not equal to `num[j + 1]`; `cn` is `n`; `ii` is `ii + 1`; `ck` is `ck + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `ck` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
