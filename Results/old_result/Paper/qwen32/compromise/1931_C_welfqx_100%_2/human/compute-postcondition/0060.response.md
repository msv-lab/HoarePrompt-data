To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior:

The loop iterates `n-1` times, and in each iteration, it checks if the current element in the reversed list `onum` is equal to the next element. If they are equal, it increments the counter `ck`. If they are not equal, it breaks out of the loop. This means that `ck` will count the number of consecutive equal elements from the end of the original list `num`.

Given that the loop runs `n-1` times, the final state of `ck` will be the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of `num` and moving towards the first element, until it finds a different element or reaches the start of the list.

Let's summarize the final output state:

- `t` remains the same as the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` remains the same as the input integer, which must be greater than 1.
- `f` remains 1.
- `num` remains the same list of integers obtained from the input.
- `j` remains `n - 2`.
- `onum` remains a reversed copy of `num`.
- `symb1` remains the first element of `num`.
- `symb2` remains the last element of `num`.
- `ck` will be the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of `num` and moving towards the first element until a different element is encountered or the start of the list is reached.
- `cn` remains the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, and `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the last element of `num` and moving towards the first element until a different element is encountered or the start of the list is reached. `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`.**

In simpler terms, `ck` will count how many elements from the end of `num` are the same consecutively, and all other variables will remain as they were initially.
