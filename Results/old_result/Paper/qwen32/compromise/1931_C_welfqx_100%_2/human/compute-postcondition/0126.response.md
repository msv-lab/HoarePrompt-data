Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `f` is 1, `num` is the input list of integers, `onum` is the input list of integers, `symb1` is the first element of the input list, and `symb2` is the first element of the input list. If `symb1` equals `symb2`, then `ck` is the number of consecutive equal elements found before the loop breaks or `n` if all elements in `onum` are equal, plus the number of consecutive equal elements found before the loop breaks or `n` if all elements in `num` are equal. If `symb1` does not equal `symb2`, `ck` remains unchanged as the number of consecutive equal elements found before the loop breaks or `n` if all elements in `onum` are equal. `r` is `r_prev + 1` if `n` equals 1 or `f` equals 1, and `j` is `n - 2` if all elements in `num` are equal, otherwise `j` is the value of `i` when the loop breaks.**
