Reasoning:

The provided program is incorrect based on the problem statement and the logic required to solve it. The main issue lies in the logic used to determine the prices for the stalls and the number of stalls needed to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

The function `func_1` contains the following logic:
1. If `n == k`, it prints "YES", sets up 1 stall with a price of 1, and Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
2. If `n < k`, it prints "NO" because Alice doesn't have enough coins to buy `k` jewels.
3. If `n > k`, it sets up two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]` and calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy from these stalls. However, this logic is flawed:
   - The calculation `curr = n // i` and `h += curr` does not correctly determine the number of jewels Alice can buy.
   - The final check `if (h < k)` is incorrect because the logic for setting up the stalls and calculating the number of jewels is flawed.
   - The prices `[n - k + 1, 1]` do not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels; they are not systematically generated to ensure the correct number of jewels.

A correct approach would be to use a greedy strategy to set up the stalls with prices that ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One possible strategy is to use binary representation or a similar method to distribute the prices in a way that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The program provided does not implement such a strategy.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
