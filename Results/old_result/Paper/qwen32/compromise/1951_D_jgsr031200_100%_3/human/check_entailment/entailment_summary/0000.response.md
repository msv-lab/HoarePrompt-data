Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The main issue is that the logic to determine the prices of the stalls and the number of stalls is flawed. The program only considers two prices (`n - k + 1` and `1`) and does not ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. Additionally, the program does not make use of the constraint that Bob can set up at most 60 stalls optimally to achieve the goal.

The example in the problem statement shows that the solution should involve setting up multiple stalls with different prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The given program does not follow this approach and fails to provide a correct solution for the given problem constraints.

For example, consider the third test case from the problem statement:
- Input: `255 8`
- Expected output: `YES`, `8`, and a list of prices that would result in Alice buying exactly 8 jewels.

The provided program will not produce the correct output for this case as it only considers two prices and does not ensure the exact number of jewels bought.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
