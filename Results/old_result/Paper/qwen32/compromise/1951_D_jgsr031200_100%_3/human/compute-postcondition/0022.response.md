Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}). It prints "YES" and additional information if it is possible to perform a series of operations such that the sum of the operations is at least `k`. Otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value (None).**
