The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print(1)
```

The initial state provides information about the variables `n` and `k`, stating that they are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and that the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`. However, the `print` statement does not reference these variables at all. It simply prints the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
