Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` is unchanged (its value is not specified, but it is used in the calculations).
   - `costs` is defined as `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - `h` is defined as the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n`, and it is stated that `h` is not less than `k`.

2. **Calculations:**
   - Since `n` is 0, `costs` becomes `[0 - k + 1, 1]` which simplifies to `[1 - k, 1]`.
   - For `h`, we need to evaluate `n // (n - k + 1)`. Given `n` is 0, this becomes `0 // (0 - k + 1)` which simplifies to `0 // (1 - k)`.
     - The value of `0 // (1 - k)` is 0 for any `k` (as long as `k` is not 1, to avoid division by zero).
     - Therefore, `h` becomes `0 + 0` which is `0`.
     - However, it is mentioned that `h` is not less than `k`, so this implies `k` must be 0 or negative (since `h` is 0).

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(*costs)` statement will unpack the `costs` list and print its elements.
   - Since `costs` is `[1 - k, 1]`, and without a specific value for `k` other than it not making `h` less than `k`, we can assume `k` is 0 to satisfy the condition `h >= k`.
     - If `k` is 0, then `costs` becomes `[1 - 0, 1]` which simplifies to `[1, 1]`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the elements of the `costs` list.

Output: **1 1**
