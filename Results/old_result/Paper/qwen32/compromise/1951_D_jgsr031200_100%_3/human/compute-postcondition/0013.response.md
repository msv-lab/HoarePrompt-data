To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's analyze the loop step-by-step:

The loop iterates over the `costs` list which contains two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`.

1. **First Iteration (i = n - k + 1):**
   - `curr = n // i` computes the integer division of `n` by `i`.
   - `h += curr` adds the result of `curr` to `h`.
   - `n -= i * curr` reduces `n` by `i * curr`.

2. **Second Iteration (i = 1):**
   - `curr = n // i` computes the integer division of `n` by `1`, which is simply `n`.
   - `h += curr` adds `n` to `h`.
   - `n -= i * curr` reduces `n` by `n`, making `n` equal to `0`.

The loop stops after these two iterations because there are no more elements in the `costs` list.

Now, let's summarize the changes to the variables:
- `h` is incremented by `n // (n - k + 1)` during the first iteration and then by `n` during the second iteration.
- `n` is reduced to `0` after the second iteration.

The other variables (`k`, `costs`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Output State: **n is 0, k is unchanged, costs is [n - k + 1, 1], h is the sum of n // (n - k + 1) and n.**
