The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `m`. The loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, and it runs as long as `i` is greater than 0.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be decremented by 1, so `i` should be `m - 2`. The value of `m` remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `m - 2`**
