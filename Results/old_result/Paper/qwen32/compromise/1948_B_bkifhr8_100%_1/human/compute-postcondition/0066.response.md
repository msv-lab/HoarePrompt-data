Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and is now `n-1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 1, and `ans` is True. `nums` is a list that contains the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and `nums` is not sorted.**
