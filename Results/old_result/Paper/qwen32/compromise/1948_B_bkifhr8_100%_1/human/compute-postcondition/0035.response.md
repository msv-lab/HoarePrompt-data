Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, and `ans` is True. The current element `arr[i]` is less than the previous element `arr[i - 1]`.**
