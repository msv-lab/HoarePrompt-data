Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is `n-1` (must be greater than 0 at the start of the loop), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a modified list based on the loop's conditions, and `ans` is either True or False depending on whether any `nums` constructed during the loop was not sorted.**

Explanation: The value of `m` is updated to the integer value of the input provided. All other variables remain unchanged.
