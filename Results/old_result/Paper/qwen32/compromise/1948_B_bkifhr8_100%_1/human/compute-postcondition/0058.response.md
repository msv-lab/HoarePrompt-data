To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` is an integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99.
- `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 4.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `ans` is initialized to True and will remain True unless a condition within the loop sets it to False.

### Code Analysis:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

This statement uses a list `['NO', 'YES']` and indexes it with the value of `ans`. In Python, `True` is equivalent to 1 and `False` is equivalent to 0. Therefore:
- If `ans` is `True`, `['NO', 'YES'][ans]` evaluates to `['NO', 'YES'][1]` which is `'YES'`.
- If `ans` is `False`, `['NO', 'YES'][ans]` evaluates to `['NO', 'YES'][0]` which is `'NO'`.

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state, `ans` is set to `True` unless a condition within the loop sets it to `False`. Since the loop and its conditions are not provided in the initial state, we assume that `ans` remains `True` unless explicitly changed.

Output: **YES (where 'YES' is printed if `ans` is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed if `ans` is set to False within the loop)**

However, since we are asked to provide the most precise description possible based on the given information and `ans` is initialized to `True` and no further information about the loop is provided, we can assume that `ans` remains `True`.

Output: **YES**
