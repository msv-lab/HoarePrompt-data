The code snippet provided sets the variable `ans` to `True`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `arr`, or the initial condition of `ans` (which was either `True` or `False`).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is `n-1` (must be greater than 0 at the start of the loop), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `ans` is True.**
