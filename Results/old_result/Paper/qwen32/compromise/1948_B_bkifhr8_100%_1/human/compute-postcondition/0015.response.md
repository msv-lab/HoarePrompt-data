The code snippet takes the integer at the index `i - 1` from the list `arr`, converts it to a string, and then converts each character back to an integer to form a list of digits. It then appends the integer at index `i` from the list `arr` to this list of digits. 

Given the initial state, `i` is `m - 2`, so `arr[i - 1]` is `arr[m - 3]` and `arr[i]` is `arr[m - 2]`. The variable `nums` is created as a result of this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `m - 2`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[m - 3]` followed by `arr[m - 2]`.**
