The code snippet takes the integer at index `i-1` of the list `arr`, converts it to a string, then to a list of its digits (each digit as an integer), and appends the integer at index `i` of `arr` to this list. The result is stored in the variable `nums`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is an integer greater than 0
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99
- `m` is at least 2
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input
- `i` is 2

The value of `nums` is now a list consisting of the digits of `arr[1]` followed by `arr[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 2, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[1]` and the last element is `arr[2]`.**
