Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `m - 3`. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list created by converting the integer `arr[m - 4]` to its digits and appending `arr[m - 3]` to this list, and `ans` is either unchanged or set to False if `nums` is not sorted. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
