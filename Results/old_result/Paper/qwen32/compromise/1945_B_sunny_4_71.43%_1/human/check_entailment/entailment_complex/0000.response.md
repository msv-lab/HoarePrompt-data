Reasoning:

The provided program calculates the number of fireworks visible from each installation independently and sums them up. However, this approach does not account for the overlap in visibility times of fireworks from both installations.

Let's break down the logic of the program:
- For each test case, the program calculates `A` as `int(m / a) + 1`, which represents the number of fireworks launched by the first installation that are visible during the first `m+1` minutes. This is correct because a firework launched at time `k*a` (for `k=0,1,2,...`) will be visible in the range `[k*a, k*a+m]`. The largest such `k` for which `k*a <= m` is `int(m / a)`, and we add 1 to include this firework.
- Similarly, it calculates `B` as `int(m / b) + 1` for the second installation.
- The program then outputs `A + B` as the total number of fireworks visible at the same time.

However, this calculation is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of fireworks from both installations being visible simultaneously. For example, if `a` and `b` are relatively small compared to `m`, and if the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` is less than or equal to `m`, then fireworks from both installations could be visible at the same time, and they would be counted twice in the sum `A + B`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to account for the overlap. Specifically, we need to calculate the number of fireworks launched by both installations that are visible at the same time and subtract this overlap from the sum `A + B`. The overlap can be determined by considering the LCM of `a` and `b`.

Thus, the program provided does not correctly account for the overlap and will give incorrect results for cases where fireworks from both installations are visible simultaneously.

Correctness: **False**
