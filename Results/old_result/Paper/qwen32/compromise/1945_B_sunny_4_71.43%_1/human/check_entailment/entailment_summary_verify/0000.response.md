Reasoning: The original assessment is correct in challenging the program's correctness. The provided code does not account for the overlaps in the visibility periods of fireworks launched by the two installations. 

Let's break down why the provided code is incorrect:

1. **Calculation of `A` and `B`:**
   - `A = int(m / a) + 1` calculates the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility duration `m`. This is correct in the sense that it counts how many times the first installation launches a firework within the first `m` minutes.
   - `B = int(m / b) + 1` calculates the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the visibility duration `m`. Similarly, this is correct in counting the number of launches within the first `m` minutes.

2. **Summing `A` and `B`:**
   - The code simply adds `A` and `B` to get the total number of fireworks visible at any point in time. However, this approach does not account for the fact that fireworks launched by both installations can overlap in their visibility periods. For example, if both installations launch fireworks at the same time, those fireworks will be counted twice, leading to an overestimate of the number of fireworks visible simultaneously.

3. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the input `7 8 56`, the code calculates `A = 9` and `B = 8`, and then sums them to get `17`. However, as mentioned in the original assessment, the correct answer is indeed `17`, but this is a special case where the fireworks overlap perfectly at minute 56 and remain visible until minute 112. In general, the overlap needs to be considered for all possible launch times within `m`.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly solve this problem, one needs to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to find the periodicity of overlapping fireworks. Then, one needs to calculate the number of fireworks visible at each point in time, taking into account the overlaps.

Given that the provided code does not account for these overlaps and simply sums the counts, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
