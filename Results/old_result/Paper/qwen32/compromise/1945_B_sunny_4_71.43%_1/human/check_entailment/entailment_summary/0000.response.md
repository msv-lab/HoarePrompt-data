Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the number of fireworks visible at any point in time from each installation separately and then summing these numbers. However, this approach does not account for the overlap in the visibility of fireworks between the two installations.

The program calculates `A` as the number of fireworks launched by the first installation that are visible during the first `m` minutes, and `B` as the number of fireworks launched by the second installation that are visible during the first `m` minutes. It then adds these two numbers together to get the total number of fireworks visible at any point in time.

However, this method does not consider the possibility of fireworks from both installations being visible at the same time. For example, if a firework from the first installation is launched at minute `x` and a firework from the second installation is launched at minute `y`, and `|x - y| <= m`, then both fireworks will be visible simultaneously for some period of time. The program does not account for such overlaps, which can lead to an incorrect result.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of overlapping fireworks and then calculate the number of fireworks visible simultaneously considering these overlaps.

Therefore, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
