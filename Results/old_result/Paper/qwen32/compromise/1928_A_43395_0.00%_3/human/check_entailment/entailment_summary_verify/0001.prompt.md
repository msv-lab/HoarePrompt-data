You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `a` and `b`. It prints 'yes' if either both `a` and `b` are even, or if the difference between `a` and `b` is non-zero. Otherwise, it prints 'no'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob can cut a rectangle of size `a x b` into two smaller rectangles and then try to form a new rectangle from these two pieces. The key points to consider:
1. If `a x b` can be cut into two rectangles and these two rectangles can form a new rectangle that is not a 90° rotation of the original, then the answer is "Yes".
2. Otherwise, the answer is "No".

### Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:
1. If `a` or `b` is even, then Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new rectangle. This is because he can cut along the longer side if it is even, and the resulting pieces can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
2. If both `a` and `b` are odd, then the only possible cuts will result in two rectangles of size `a x 1` and `b x 1` (or `1 x a` and `1 x b`), and these cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle other than a 90° rotation of the original.

### Analyzing the Program:
Let's examine the logic in the provided code:
1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `a` and `b`.
3. It checks if both `a` and `b` are even. If so, it prints "yes" (which is correct based on the problem analysis).
4. It then has a condition that checks `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)`, which is syntactically incorrect and does not make logical sense in the context of the problem.
5. The next condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is always true for any non-zero `a` and `b` because the difference `a - b` can never be both greater than 0 and less than 0 simultaneously. This condition is not meaningful for determining the solution.
6. The `else` block prints "no", which is not always correct, as it does not account for the case where `a` or `b` is even.

### Correctness:
The program is incorrect due to the following reasons:
- The condition `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)` is syntactically incorrect and logically irrelevant.
- The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is always true for non-zero differences, which is not helpful.
- The program does not correctly handle the case where one of `a` or `b` is even.

### Correct Approach:
The correct approach should be:
- If either `a` or `b` is even, print "yes".
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, print "no".

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
