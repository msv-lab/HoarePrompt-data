### Reasoning:
Let's break down the problem and the program to see if the logic aligns with the requirements.

The problem states that Bob can form a new rectangle from the two resulting rectangles if:
1. He can cut the original rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides.
2. These two rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one (considering 90Â° rotations as the same).

The key observation is that:
- If both `a` and `b` are even, the original rectangle can be cut into two rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
- If `a` and `b` are not both even, the only way to form a new rectangle is if the difference between `a` and `b` is non-zero (i.e., `a` and `b` are not equal). This is because if `a` and `b` are equal, the only rectangles that can be formed are rotations of the original rectangle.

Now, let's analyze the provided program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

- The first condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` correctly identifies when both dimensions are even.
- The second condition `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):` is incorrect. It seems to be trying to check if `a` and `b` are equal, but the logic is flawed. The condition should simply check `a == b`.
- The third condition `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:` is also incorrect. It will always evaluate to `True` because the difference between two integers is never zero in this context (since the previous condition would have handled the case where both dimensions are even). The correct condition should be `elif a != b:`.
- The `else` condition is correct as it handles the case where `a` and `b` are both odd and equal, which means no new rectangle can be formed.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif a == b:
            print('no')
        else:
            print('yes')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the flawed conditions. The logic should be corrected as shown above.

Correctness: **False**
