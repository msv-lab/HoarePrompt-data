The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the given constraints and logic, which involves sorting the list and performing arithmetic operations involving `n`, `m`, `k`, and the elements of `a`.
