Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l.sort()
    s = 0
    c = k * k / 2
    for i in range(n):
        s = min(m, k)
        k -= s
        c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2
    print(int(c))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is unchanged; `m` is unchanged; `k` is reduced by the total `s` accumulated over all iterations; `l` is unchanged; `s` is the value from the last iteration; `c` is the accumulated value after all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `k` is reduced by the total `s` accumulated over all iterations; `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input; `s` is `min(m, k)` from the last iteration; `c` is updated to `k * k / 2 + Σ(l[i] * s - s * s / 2)` for all iterations; `i` is `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the initial `k` minus the sum of `min(m, k_i)` for each iteration `i`, `l` is the newly read sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is the last computed value of `min(m, k_i)` from the final iteration, `c` is the accumulated value of `k * k / 2 + sum(l[i] * s_i - s_i * s_i / 2) for each iteration i`, `i` is `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
