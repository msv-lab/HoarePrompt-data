The given code snippet modifies the value of `c` by adding `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to its current value. No other variables are altered by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1`
- `m` is the second integer from the input
- `k` is `k - min(m, k) - s`
- `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input
- `s` is `min(m, k)`
- `c` is `k * k / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`
- `i` is `i + 1`

After executing the code snippet `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, the new value of `c` will be:

`c` is now `k * k / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, which simplifies to `k * k / 2 + 2 * (l[i] * s - s * s / 2)`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`; `m` is the second integer from the input; `k` is `k - min(m, k) - s`; `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input; `s` is `min(m, k)`; `c` is `k * k / 2 + 2 * (l[i] * s - s * s / 2)`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
