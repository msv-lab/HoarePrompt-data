Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `k` is `k - s`, `c` is updated by adding `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to its previous value.**

Explanation: The value of `c` is updated by adding the expression `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to its current value. The values of `n`, `i`, `s`, and `k` remain as described in the initial state.
