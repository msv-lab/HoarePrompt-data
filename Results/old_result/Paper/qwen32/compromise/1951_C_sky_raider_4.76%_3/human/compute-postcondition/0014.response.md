The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented from its current value. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it determines the total number of iterations the loop will perform.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is greater than 0
- `m` is unchanged
- `k` is `k - 2s`
- `l` is a sorted list of integers
- `s` is the smaller of `m` and the original `k`
- `c` is \(\frac{k^2}{2} + 2 \cdot (l[i] \cdot s) - s^2\)
- `i` is incremented by 1

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value, and `n` should remain the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is unchanged, `k` is `k - 2s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `s` is the smaller of `m` and the original `k`, `c` is \(\frac{k^2}{2} + 2 \cdot (l[i] \cdot s) - s^2\), `i` is incremented by 1** 

Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the last iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the value it just became. Therefore, we simply need to reflect that `i` has been incremented:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1** 

To be more precise, if `i` was `x` at the end of the last iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`** 

However, since we are asked to provide a concrete state, let's assume `i` was some specific value `x` at the end of the last iteration. For the sake of this example, let's say `i` was 2 at the end of the last iteration. Then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is unchanged, `k` is `k - 2s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `s` is the smaller of `m` and the original `k`, `c` is \(\frac{k^2}{2} + 2 \cdot (l[i] \cdot s) - s^2\), `i` is 3**

But generally, without knowing the exact value of `i` at the end of the last iteration, the most accurate state representation would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1** 

Or more precisely reflecting the change:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`**

Since the task specifies to only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, the final state considering only `i` and `n` is:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`**
