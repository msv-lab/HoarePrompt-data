Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `l` is the newly read sorted list of integers from the input, `s` is 0, `c` is updated to `k * k / 2 + Σ(l[i] * s - s * s / 2)` for all iterations, `i` is `n + 1`.**

Natural Language: The variable `s` has been set to 0. All other variables retain their previous values.
