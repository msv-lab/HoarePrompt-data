The given code snippet updates the value of `s` to be the minimum of `m` and `k`. This means that if `m` was previously smaller than `k`, `s` remains `m`, and if `k` was smaller, `s` becomes `k`. No other variables are modified by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 0; `m` and `k` are integers read from the input, with `k` being `k - s`; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `s` is the smaller of `m` and `k`; `c` is \(\frac{k^2}{2} + l[i] \cdot s - \frac{s^2}{2}\); `i` is incremented by 1**.
