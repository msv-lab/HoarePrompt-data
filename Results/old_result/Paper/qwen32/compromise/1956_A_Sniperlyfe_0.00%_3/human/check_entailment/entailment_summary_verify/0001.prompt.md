You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene invented a new game based on an increasing sequence of integers a_1, a_2,
\ldots, a_k .

In this game, initially n players are lined up in a row. In each of the rounds
of this game, the following happens:

  * Nene finds the a_1 -th, a_2 -th, \ldots , a_k -th players in a row. They are kicked out of the game simultaneously. If the i -th player in a row should be kicked out, but there are fewer than i players in a row, they are skipped. 

Once no one is kicked out of the game in some round, all the players that are
still in the game are declared as winners.

For example, consider the game with a=[3, 5] and n=5 players. Let the players
be named player A, player B, \ldots , player E in the order they are lined up
initially. Then,

  * Before the first round, players are lined up as ABCDE. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. These are players C and E. They are kicked out in the first round. 
  * Now players are lined up as ABD. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. The 3 -rd player is player D and there is no 5 -th player in a row. Thus, only player D is kicked out in the second round. 
  * In the third round, no one is kicked out of the game, so the game ends after this round. 
  * Players A and B are declared as the winners. 

Nene has not yet decided how many people would join the game initially. Nene
gave you q integers n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_q and you should answer the following
question for each 1 \le i \le q independently:

  * How many people would be declared as winners if there are n_i players in the game initially? 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 250 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line case contains two integers k and q (1 \le k, q \le 100 ) — the
length of the sequence a and the number of values n_i you should solve this
problem for.

The second line contains k integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k (1\leq
a_1<a_2<\ldots<a_k\leq 100 ) — the sequence a .

The third line contains q integers n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_q (1\leq n_i \leq 100 ).

Output

For each test case, output q integers: the i -th (1\le i \le q ) of them
should be the number of players declared as winners if initially n_i players
join the game.

Note

The first test case was explained in the statement.

In the second test case, when n=1 , the only player stays in the game in the
first round. After that, the game ends and the only player is declared as a
winner.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, p):
    while n >= min(p):
        n -= sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))
    return n

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
            print(' '.join(map(str, res)))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of players `k`, the number of queries `q`, a list `p` of positions of players to be kicked out, and a list `qs` of queries. For each query `n` in `qs`, it computes a result using `func_1(n, p)` and prints the results sequentially. The final state of the program is that it has processed all test cases and printed the results for each query in the specified format.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
- We have a sequence of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_k` which represents the positions of players to be removed in each round.
- In each round, players at these positions are removed if they exist.
- The process continues until no players are removed in a round.
- We need to determine the number of players remaining (winners) for each of `q` different initial player counts `n_1, n_2, ..., n_q`.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(n, p)`**:
    - This function simulates the game for a given number of players `n` and the sequence `p`.
    - It continues to remove players at positions specified in `p` until no more players can be removed.
    - The removal process is done by subtracting the count of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` from `n`.
    - The function returns the number of players remaining after the game ends.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
    - This function reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.
    - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads `k` (length of sequence `p`), `q` (number of player counts to evaluate), `p` (sequence of positions to remove), and `qs` (list of player counts).
    - It then iterates over each player count in `qs`, computes the number of winners using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Correctness Check:
- **Logic in `func_1`**:
    - The logic correctly simulates the game by repeatedly removing players at the specified positions.
    - The condition `n >= min(p)` ensures that the game continues only if there are enough players to potentially remove someone.
    - The sum `(1 for x in p if x <= n)` correctly counts the number of positions in `p` that are within the current player count `n`.
    - The function returns the correct number of players remaining after the game ends.

- **Logic in `func_2`**:
    - The function correctly reads and processes the input for each test case.
    - It computes the number of winners for each player count using `func_1` and prints the results.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the correct number of winners for each player count.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
