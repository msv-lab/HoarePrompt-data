The code snippet provided updates the variable `p` by reading a new list of integers from the input. The other variables (`k`, `q`, `qs`, `res`, `t`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list containing as many elements as there are integers in `qs`, where each element is the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`, `t` is `x-1`, `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.**
