To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n`: A non-negative integer representing the number of players initially in the game.
- `p`: A list of integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round.
- `t`: Must be greater than 0.
- `k` and `q`: Integers obtained from the input.
- `qs`: A list of integers obtained from the user input and must have at least one element.
- `res`: A list containing one element, which is the output of `func_1(n, p)`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Analysis:
- The `res` variable is a list containing one element, which is the output of the function `func_1(n, p)`.
- The `map(str, res)` function converts each element in the `res` list to a string.
- The `' '.join(...)` function joins these string elements with a space in between.

### Output:
The print statement will output a single string that is the string representation of the single element in the `res` list.

Since the exact value of `res` depends on the output of `func_1(n, p)`, and `func_1` is not defined in the given information, we can only describe the output in terms of `res`.

### Final Output:
Output: **[res[0]] (where res[0] is the output of func_1(n, p))**
