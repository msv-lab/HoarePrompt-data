Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of players initially in the game, `p` is a list of integers provided by user input representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, `t` must be greater than 0, `k` and `q` are integers obtained from the input, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, `res` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n in qs:
    res.append(func_1(n, p))
    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of players initially in the game, `p` is a list of integers provided by user input representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, `t` must be greater than 0, `k` and `q` are integers obtained from the input, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the user input and must have at least one element, `res` is a list containing one element, which is the output of `func_1(n, p)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is the next element in the list `qs`, `p` is a list of integers provided by user input representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, `t` must be greater than 0, `k` and `q` are integers obtained from the input, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the user input and must have at least one element, `res` is a list containing two elements, the first being the output of `func_1(n, p)` and the second being the output of `func_1(n, p)` again.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the next element in the list `qs` after the current one, `p` is a list of integers provided by user input representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, `t` must be greater than 0, `k` and `q` are integers obtained from the input, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the user input and must have at least one element, `res` is a list containing three elements, each being the output of `func_1(n, p)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
