To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state step by step:

1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `k` and `q` are integers obtained from the input.
   - `qs` is a list of integers derived from the input and has at least one element.
   - `res` is a list containing one element, which is the result of the function `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `t` is defined as `x-1`, but `x` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `t`.
   - `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `n` is the first element of the list `qs`.

2. **The print statement:**
   ```python
   print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
   ```

3. **Understanding the print statement:**
   - `map(str, res)` converts each element in the list `res` to a string.
   - `' '.join(...)` joins these string elements into a single string, separated by spaces.

4. **Determining the output:**
   - `res` contains one element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - Since the exact value of `func_1(n, p)` is not provided, we can denote the result of this function as `result_of_func_1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the string representation of `result_of_func_1`.

Output: **result_of_func_1 (where result_of_func_1 is the result of func_1(n, p))**
