Output State: **`qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 integers, `res` is a list containing two elements where the second element is the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `t` remains unchanged, `k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is the next integer in `qs`.**

In this output state, the list `res` has been updated to include the result of `func_1(n, p)` as its second element. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
