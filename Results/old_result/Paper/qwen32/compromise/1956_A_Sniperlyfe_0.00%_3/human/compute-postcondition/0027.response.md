The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `qs`. If `qs` has more integers, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the next integer in `qs`. For the loop to execute one more time, `qs` must have at least one more integer.

Since `n` is the current integer being processed, at the start of the next iteration, `n` will be the next integer in `qs`.

State: **`qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 3 integers, `res` is a list containing two elements where the second element is the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `t` remains unchanged, `k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is the next integer in `qs`**
