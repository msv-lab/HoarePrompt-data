To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the given information step-by-step:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `k` is the first input integer.
   - `q` is the second input integer.
   - `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least two elements.
   - `n` is the second element of the list `qs`.
   - `res` is a list containing two elements. Both elements are the result of the function `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `t` is `x-1`, but `x` is not defined in the provided initial state, so we can ignore `t` for this task.
   - `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.

2. **The print statement:**
   ```python
   print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
   ```
   This statement converts each element of the list `res` to a string and then joins them with a space, resulting in a single string that is printed.

3. **Determining the output:**
   - The list `res` contains two elements, both of which are the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of these elements.
   - However, we know that `res` contains two identical results from `func_1(n, p)`.

Given the above information, the output will be a string that consists of the string representations of the two results from `func_1(n, p)`, separated by a space.

Output: **result result (where result is the result of func_1(n, p))**
