The function reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of players `k`, the number of queries `q`, a list `p` of positions of players to be kicked out, and a list `qs` of queries. For each query `n` in `qs`, it computes a result using `func_1(n, p)` and prints the results sequentially. The final state of the program is that it has processed all test cases and printed the results for each query in the specified format.
