The code sorts the list `digits`. Therefore, the order of the digit characters in the `digits` list will be in ascending order. The values of `password` and `letters` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `digits` is a list containing all the digit characters from the password, sorted in ascending order; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the password.**
