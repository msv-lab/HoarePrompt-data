In the given task, the only variable in the loop head is `char`, which will iterate over each character in the `password` string. The state of `password` itself does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, as long as it is a non-empty string. The variables `digits` and `letters` are initialized outside the loop and are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given that the loop will iterate over each character in `password`, the state of `password` must ensure that it contains at least one character to allow the loop to execute. Since the problem states that `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters and `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`, `password` will inherently have at least one character.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `password` itself to ensure the loop executes. The states of `digits` and `letters` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `digits` is an empty list; `letters` is an empty list**.
