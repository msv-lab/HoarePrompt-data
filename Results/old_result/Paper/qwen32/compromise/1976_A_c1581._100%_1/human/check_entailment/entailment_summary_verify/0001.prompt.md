You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program:
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if sortedPassword == password:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` checks if the input `password` string, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, is already sorted such that all digits come before letters, and both digits and letters are individually in ascending order. It returns `True` if the password meets these conditions, otherwise it returns `False`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided code to determine its correctness.

### Problem Requirements:
1. The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the length of the password and the password itself. It then calls `func_1(password)` to check if the password meets the conditions.

#### Function `func_1(password)`:
1. **Separation of Digits and Letters**:
   - The function iterates through each character in the password.
   - If the character is a digit, it appends it to the `digits` list.
   - If the character is a letter, it appends it to the `letters` list.
   
2. **Sorting**:
   - The `digits` list is sorted.
   - The `letters` list is sorted.
   
3. **Validation**:
   - The function checks if the sorted `digits` list is in non-decreasing order. This check is redundant because the list is already sorted.
   - The function then checks if the last digit in the sorted `digits` list is less than or equal to the first letter in the sorted `letters` list. If not, the function returns `False`.
   - The function constructs a `sortedPassword` by concatenating the sorted `digits` and `letters` lists.
   - Finally, it checks if `sortedPassword` is equal to the original `password`. If they are equal, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Issues:
- The function does not correctly handle the condition that no digit should come after a letter in the original password. It only checks if the last digit is less than or equal to the first letter in the sorted lists, which is not sufficient.
- The function should ensure that all digits appear before any letters in the original password.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the provided code does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Specifically, it does not verify that no digit comes after a letter in the original password.

Thus, the program is **incorrect**.

### Correctness: **False**
