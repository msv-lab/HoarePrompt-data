You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves two players, Anna and Sasha, playing optimally. The game ends when there is only one number left in the list. The rules are:

1. **Anna's Turn**: She can choose any number in the list and reverse its digits, removing any leading zeros.
2. **Sasha's Turn**: He can choose any two distinct numbers, concatenate them in any order, and replace them with the concatenated number.

The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, meaning there is only one number left in the list. If this number is not less than \( 10^m \), Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution uses two functions:

1. **`func_1(n, m, nums)`**: This is the main function that determines the winner based on the number of digits and the count of trailing zeros in each number.
2. **`zerocnts(num)`**: This function counts the number of trailing zeros in a given number.

Let's break down the logic of `func_1`:

- **`tot = sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))`**: This line calculates the total number of digits in all numbers in the list.
- **`cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)`**: This line calculates the number of trailing zeros for each number and sorts these counts in descending order.
- **`for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2): tot -= cntvals[i]`**: This loop iterates through the sorted trailing zero counts, subtracting the counts at even indices from `tot`. This step is crucial because it simulates the optimal moves of Sasha and Anna.
- **`return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'`**: Finally, it checks if the remaining total number of digits (`tot`) is greater than or equal to \( m + 1 \). If so, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Key Points to Consider

1. **Trailing Zeros**: The strategy hinges on the number of trailing zeros because reversing a number with trailing zeros reduces its length. Sasha can concatenate numbers to increase the length of the remaining number, while Anna can remove trailing zeros to decrease the length.
2. **Optimal Play**: The solution assumes both players play optimally. Anna's optimal move is to remove as many trailing zeros as possible, while Sasha's optimal move is to concatenate numbers to maximize the length of the remaining number.
3. **Correctness of the Logic**: The logic correctly simulates the effect of Anna's and Sasha's moves on the total number of digits. By sorting the trailing zeros in descending order and subtracting the counts at even indices, the solution effectively simulates Sasha's and Anna's turns.

### Conclusion

The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the given rules and optimal play by both players. Therefore, the program is correct.
