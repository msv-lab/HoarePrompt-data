The code snippet creates a list called `sequence` that contains the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{24}\). The variables `t`, `cases`, and `results` are not affected by this code. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and k such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n; `results` is an empty list; `sequence` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216]**.
