### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem description to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Analysis

The problem requires performing exactly `k` operations on an array, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations, and the result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided code:

##### Function 1: `func_1(number)`
```python
def func_1(number):
    return number % 1000000007
```
- This function correctly returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It's a utility function for handling large numbers.

##### Function 2: `func_2(arr)`
```python
def func_2(arr):
    new_segment = []
    max_segment = [0, 0]
    segments_variants = []
    max_sum = -1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if new_segment:
            if arr[i] < 0:
                if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
                else:
                    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                    max_segment = new_segment
                new_segment = []
                max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            else:
                max_segment[0] += arr[i]
                new_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            if arr[i] >= 0:
                new_segment = [arr[i], i]
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    total_max_segment = [-1]
    for segment in segments_variants:
        if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0] and len(segment) != 1:
            total_max_segment = segment
    return total_max_segment
```
- The purpose of this function is to find the maximum sum contiguous subarray in the array `arr`. However, the implementation is flawed. The logic for managing `max_segment` and `new_segment` is incorrect, and the way segments are appended to `segments_variants` is also flawed. This function does not correctly identify the maximum sum subarray.

##### Function 3: `func_3(number, quantity)`
```python
def func_3(number, quantity):
    answer = 0
```
- This function is incomplete and does not implement the logic for performing the operations and calculating the maximum possible sum. The function summary provided for `func_3` does not match the code, as the function is supposed to handle the main logic of the problem but is currently just a placeholder.

#### Correctness Evaluation

The provided program is incomplete and contains errors, particularly in `func_2`. The logic for finding the maximum sum subarray is flawed, and `func_3` is not implemented at all. Therefore, the program cannot correctly solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation

Based on the analysis, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
