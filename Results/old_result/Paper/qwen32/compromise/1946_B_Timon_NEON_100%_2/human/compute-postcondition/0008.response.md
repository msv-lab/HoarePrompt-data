Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, where each integer a_i satisfies -10^9 <= a_i <= 10^9; `new_segment` is [5, 6]; `max_segment` is [12, 6]; `segments_variants` is [[3, 1], [9, 4], [12, 6, len(arr) - 1], [5, 6, len(arr) - 1]]; `max_sum` is -1; `total_max_segment` is [-1]**.

Natural Language: The variable `total_max_segment` is now assigned the value `[-1]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
