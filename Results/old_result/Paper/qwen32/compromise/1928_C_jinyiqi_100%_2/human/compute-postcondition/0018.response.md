Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a list of divisors of `x`. The list combines two sets of divisors: the first set contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order, and the second set contains all divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`.**
