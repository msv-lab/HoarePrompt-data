The code appends the integer division of `x` by `i` to the list `output2`. The values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged, and `i` has already been incremented by 1 before this line of code is executed. Therefore, the only change is to `output2`.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, `i` is incremented by 1, `output1` contains the value of `i` appended to it, `output2` contains the value of `int(x / i)` appended to it.**
