The given code initializes a new list named `output2` and does not modify any of the existing variables `x`, `n`, or `output1`. Therefore, the values of `x`, `n`, and `output1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `output1` is an empty list; `output2` is an empty list.**
