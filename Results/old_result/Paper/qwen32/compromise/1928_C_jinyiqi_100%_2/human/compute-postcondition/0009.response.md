The code appends the integer division of `x` by `i` to the list `output2`. The values of `x`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged, but `output2` is updated with the new value.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, `i` is incremented by 1, `output1` has `i` appended to it, `output2` has `int(x / i)` appended to it.**
