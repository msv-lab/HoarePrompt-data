You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    output = list(set(output))
    print(len(output))

def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a list of all divisors of `x`, sorted such that divisors greater than or equal to the square root of `x` come first, followed by divisors less than the square root of `x` in reverse order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that cause it not to work as expected according to the problem description. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Undefined Function**: The function `func_1` is used but not defined in the provided code. This will cause a `NameError` when the code is executed.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `k` Values**:
   - The logic for calculating `k` values is incorrect. The program attempts to find divisors of `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)`, but this does not align with the problem description. The problem requires finding `k` such that the position `n` and number `x` fit the described pattern.
   - The formula `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` does not help in determining the correct `k` values. The pattern described in the problem involves a repeating sequence of length `2k - 2`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not correctly handle edge cases or ensure that `k` is greater than 1.
   - The logic for checking `k` values is flawed, and it does not correctly account for the periodic nature of the sequence.

Let's consider a simple example to illustrate the issue:

**Example:**
Input:
```
1
10 2
```
Expected Output:
```
4
```
Explanation:
- For `k = 2`, the sequence is `1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2`.
- For `k = 3`, the sequence is `1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2`.
- For `k = 5`, the sequence is `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2`.
- For `k = 6`, the sequence is `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2`.

The provided program does not correctly identify these `k` values.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, so the correctness is **False**.
