Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the specified operations. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Loop and Indexing**:
   - The loop `for i in range(0, a - 2):` is incorrect because it should start from index 1 (second element) and go up to `a - 2` (second last element) as per the problem description.
   - The operation `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` and `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` are incorrect because they do not follow the described operation. Instead, they should be `b[i - 1] -= 1`, `b[i] -= 2`, and `b[i + 1] -= 1`.

2. **Incorrect Termination Condition**:
   - The condition `if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:` is not sufficient to determine if all elements can be zero. It only checks the last two elements, but the operation can affect any elements in the array.

3. **Negative Values**:
   - The check `if b[i] < 0:` is incorrect because the problem does not specify that elements can become negative. The operation should ensure that no negative values are introduced, but the logic should focus on making all elements zero.

4. **Logic to Make Elements Zero**:
   - The logic to make elements zero is not correctly implemented. The program does not correctly simulate the operation and does not ensure that all elements can be reduced to zero.

### Counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 3 5 5 2
```

The correct output should be `YES`, but the provided program does not correctly handle this case because of the incorrect logic.

### Correct Implementation Example:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the sum of the array is even, which is a necessary condition
        if sum(b) % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Try to make all elements zero
        for i in range(1, a - 1):
            if b[i] >= 2 and b[i - 1] >= 1 and b[i + 1] >= 1:
                b[i] -= 2
                b[i - 1] -= 1
                b[i + 1] -= 1
        
        # Check if all elements are zero
        if all(x == 0 for x in b):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
# func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the operations are applied correctly and checks if all elements can be made zero. It also includes a necessary condition that the sum of the array must be even for it to be possible to make all elements zero.
