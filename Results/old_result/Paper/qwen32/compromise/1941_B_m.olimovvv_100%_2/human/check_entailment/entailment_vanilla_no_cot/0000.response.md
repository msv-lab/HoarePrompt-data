Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations. Here are the main issues:

1. The program incorrectly modifies the array elements in a way that does not reflect the actual operations described in the problem. Specifically, the operations involve subtracting 1 from `a[i-1]`, 2 from `a[i]`, and 1 from `a[i+1]` when the operation is applied at index `i`. The current program subtracts `b[i] * 2` from `b[i+1]` and `b[i]` from `b[i+2]`, which is not the correct operation.

2. The program does not correctly handle the state of the array after each operation. The operations should be applied in such a way that the array can potentially be reduced to all zeros, but the current approach does not ensure this.

3. The program does not account for the possibility of negative values in the array after applying operations, which would indicate that the operations cannot be validly applied.

Here's a revised version of the program that correctly checks if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the sum of the array is even, which is a necessary condition
        if sum(a) % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Try to reduce the array to all zeros
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if a[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            # Apply the operation as many times as possible at index i
            op = min(a[i] // 2, a[i-1], a[i+1])
            a[i-1] -= op
            a[i] -= 2 * op
            a[i+1] -= op
        
        # Check if all elements are zero
        if all(x == 0 for x in a):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This revised program correctly applies the operations and checks if the array can be reduced to all zeros. It also includes a necessary condition check (the sum of the array must be even) to quickly determine if a solution is impossible.
