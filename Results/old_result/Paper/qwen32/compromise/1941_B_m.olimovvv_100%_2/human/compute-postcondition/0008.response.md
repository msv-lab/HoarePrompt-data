Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is an integer greater than 2; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, where `b[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * b[i]`. If the current element `b[i]` is less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of `t`, `a`, and `b` remains unchanged.**

In simple terms, the value of `b[i + 1]` is updated by subtracting twice the value of `b[i]` from it. The values of `t`, `a`, and all other elements of `b` remain the same unless `b[i]` is less than 0, in which case the loop or if statement is exited.
