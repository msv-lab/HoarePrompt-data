The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`. The loop will execute if the range `(0, a - 2)` is non-empty, which means `a - 2` must be greater than 0, or equivalently, `a` must be greater than 2.

The state of `b` (the list of integers) and the output ('YES') are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted based on the loop head criteria. However, since the task specifies we should only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we focus on `a`.

State: **`a` must be greater than 2**
