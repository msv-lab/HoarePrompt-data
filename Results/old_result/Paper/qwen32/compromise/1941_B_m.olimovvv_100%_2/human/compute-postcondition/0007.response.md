Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is an integer greater than 2; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If the current element `b[i]` is less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of `t`, `a`, and `b` remains unchanged.**
