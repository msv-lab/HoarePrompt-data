The code snippet `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` modifies the value of `b[i + 2]` by subtracting `b[i]` from it. The other conditions and values provided in the initial state remain unchanged unless directly affected by this operation.

Given:
- `a` is greater than `i + 2`
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`

After executing the code:
- `b[i + 2]` is updated to `b[i + 2] - b[i]`

Output State: **`a` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 1`, `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` is `b[i + 2] - b[i]`**.
