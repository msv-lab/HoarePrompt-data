The code `b[i] -= b[i]` modifies the value of `b[i]` by subtracting its current value from itself, which sets `b[i]` to 0. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `b[0]` is set to 0. The values of `a`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `b[0]` is 0, `b[1]` is `b[1] - 2 * b[0]`, `b[2]` is `b[2] - b[0]`**. 

In simpler terms, `a` remains at least 2, `i` remains 0, `b[0]` becomes 0, and the values of `b[1]` and `b[2]` remain as `b[1] - 2 * b[0]` and `b[2] - b[0]` respectively, which simplifies to `b[1]` and `b[2]` since `b[0]` is now 0.
