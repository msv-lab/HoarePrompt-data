To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the provided loop and the output states after the first 3 iterations. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop runs for `a - 2` iterations. The loop modifies the list `b` in each iteration:
- If `b[i] < 0`, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop.
- Otherwise, it updates `b[i + 1]` to `b[i + 1] - b[i] * 2`, `b[i + 2]` to `b[i + 2] - b[i]`, and sets `b[i]` to 0.

### Output State after 3 Iterations:
- `a` is at least 4.
- `b[0]` is 0.
- `b[1]` is 0.
- `b[2]` is 0.
- `b[3]` is `b[3] - 2 * b[2]`.
- `b[4]` is `b[4] - (b[2] - 2 * b[1])`.

Since `b[0]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]` are all 0, the loop continues without breaking. We can generalize the pattern observed in the first 3 iterations.

### General Pattern:
- After the loop completes all `a - 2` iterations, the first `a - 2` elements of `b` will all be 0.
- The elements `b[a-1]` and `b[a-2]` will be modified according to the rules of the loop.

### Final Output State:
- The loop completes all `a - 2` iterations without breaking, meaning `b[i]` was never less than 0 for any `i`.
- The first `a - 2` elements of `b` are all 0.
- The final check after the loop is to see if `b[-1]` and `b[-2]` are both 0. If they are, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Conclusion:
Given that the loop completes all iterations and the first `a - 2` elements of `b` are 0, the final output state depends on whether `b[-1]` and `b[-2]` are 0. Since the problem states that the output is 'YES' if `b[-2]` and `b[-1]` are both 0, we conclude that after all iterations, `b[-1]` and `b[-2]` must be 0 for the output to be 'YES'.

Output State: **b[-2] is 0, b[-1] is 0, and the output is 'YES'.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop, the second-to-last and last elements of the list `b` are both 0, resulting in the output 'YES'.
