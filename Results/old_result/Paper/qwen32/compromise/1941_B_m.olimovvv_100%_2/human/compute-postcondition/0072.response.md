Output State: **`a` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged by the `break` statement. The `break` statement only affects the control flow by exiting the most internal loop or if statement, without altering the values of any variables.
