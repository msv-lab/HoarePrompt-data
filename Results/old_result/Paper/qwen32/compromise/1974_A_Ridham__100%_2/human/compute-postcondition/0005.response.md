Functionality: **The function accepts no arguments. It reads from standard input, which consists of t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) test cases. Each test case contains two integers x and y (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99) representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons, respectively. For each test case, the function returns the total area covered by the icons.**
