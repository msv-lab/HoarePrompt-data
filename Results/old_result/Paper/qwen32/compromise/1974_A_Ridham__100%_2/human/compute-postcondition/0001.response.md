The code snippet initializes an empty list named `result`. This list will be used to store the results of the test cases. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. The input consists of `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) test cases. Each test case contains two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99) representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons, respectively. `result` is an empty list.**
