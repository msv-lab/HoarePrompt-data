You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no arguments. The input is read from standard input and consists of t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) test cases. Each test case contains two integers x and y (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99) representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons, respectively.

    #State: `result` is a list containing the calculated number of screens required for each test case based on the given conditions.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
    #This is printed: Each element of the `result` list printed on a new line (where each element is the number of screens required for a test case)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons. It calculates the minimum number of 5x3 screens required to fit all the icons for each test case and prints the results, one per line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Grid Size**: Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means there are 15 cells per screen.
2. **Icon Sizes**:
   - 1x1 icons take 1 cell each.
   - 2x2 icons take 4 cells each.
3. **Objective**: Place all icons on the minimum number of screens.

### Program Logic:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `x` (number of 1x1 icons) and `y` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - `space_x`: Total cells needed for 1x1 icons.
   - `space_y`: Total cells needed for 2x2 icons.
   - `total_space`: Sum of `space_x` and `space_y`.

3. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons**:
   - Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, the minimum number of screens required to accommodate `y` such icons is calculated. The formula used is:
     - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2` if `y` is even.
     - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd.
     This is because each screen can hold at most 3 2x2 icons (since 3 * 4 = 12, and the remaining 3 cells can't fit another 2x2 icon).

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - `remaining_cells`: This is the number of cells left on the screens used for 2x2 icons after placing all `y` 2x2 icons.
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.

5. **Placing 1x1 Icons**:
   - If `space_x` (total cells needed for 1x1 icons) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, all 1x1 icons can be placed on the screens already used for 2x2 icons.
   - If `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, the program calculates the number of additional screens needed to place the remaining 1x1 icons:
     - `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`.
     - `extra_screen` is calculated based on how many full screens are needed to accommodate `extra_space` cells.
     - The final number of screens is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The program logic seems to be correctly accounting for the constraints and objectives of the problem. It calculates the minimum number of screens required for 2x2 icons first, then determines if the remaining cells can accommodate the 1x1 icons. If not, it calculates additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.

### Test Cases:
The provided test cases match the expected output, which suggests that the program is correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program appears to be correctly solving the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
