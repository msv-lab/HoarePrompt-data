Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the input. It then constructs a list `mex` based on the values in `a` and prints the elements of `mex` separated by spaces. The function does not return any value explicitly but outputs the constructed list to the console.**
