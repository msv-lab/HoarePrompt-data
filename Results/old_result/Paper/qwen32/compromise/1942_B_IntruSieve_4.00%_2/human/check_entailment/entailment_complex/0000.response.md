### Reasoning:

The provided code is intended to solve the problem by constructing a permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. The core idea is to use the properties of the MEX (Minimum Excluded Value) to determine each element of `p` from the corresponding element of `a`.

The algorithm attempts to construct the permutation `p` as follows:

1. **Initialization**: It initializes `minn` to 0, which will be used to keep track of the smallest non-negative integer not yet included in the permutation `p`.

2. **Iterating through `a`**: For each element `a[i]` in the array `a`:
   - If `a[i]` is positive, it assigns `minn` to `mex[i]` (the current smallest non-negative integer not used in `p`), and then increments `minn`. If `minn` becomes equal to `maxx` (which is not explicitly used in the current logic), it increments `minn` again.
   - If `a[i]` is non-positive, it calculates `abs(a[i] - minn)` and assigns it to `mex[i]`. It also updates `maxx` if the calculated value exceeds the current `maxx`.

3. **Output**: After constructing the `mex` list, it prints the elements of `mex` as the permutation `p`.

However, there are some issues with the logic:

- The variable `maxx` is not used effectively to maintain the MEX correctly. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not yet in the permutation `p`, and it should be recalculated after each insertion into `p`.
- The condition `if minn == maxx` is not logically sound and can lead to incorrect results.
- The calculation `abs(arr[i] - minn)` for non-positive `a[i]` does not correctly reflect the MEX property.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned above, the provided code does not correctly construct the permutation `p` based on the MEX property of the array `a`. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
