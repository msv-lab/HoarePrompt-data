The function `func_1` accepts four non-negative integer parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` that are less than `n`, the length of a secret permutation `p`. It prints a formatted string `? a b c d` to the standard output and then returns the next input string provided to the program, which is expected to be in the same format.
