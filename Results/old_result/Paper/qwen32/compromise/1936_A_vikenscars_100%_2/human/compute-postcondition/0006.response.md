Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's break down the values of the variables `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` before the `print` statement is executed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `max_item_idx` is set to `n-1` and remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- `pair_idx` can be modified based on the conditions inside the loop, but without specific details about `func_1`, we can only infer general behavior:
  - If `func_1` consistently returns `'<'` for all comparisons involving `max_item_idx` and `i`, `pair_idx` will be updated to the last `i` for which `ans1` is `'<'`.
  - If `func_1` returns `'='` and then `'>'` for some `i`, `pair_idx` will be updated to that `i`.

### Assumptions:
- Since `max_item_idx` is explicitly stated to be `n-1` and not modified, its value is known.
- `pair_idx`'s final value depends on the behavior of `func_1` inside the loop. However, in the absence of specific details, we can assume the most straightforward case where `pair_idx` ends up being `n-1` if no significant comparison (either `'<'` or `'>'` after `'='`) occurs.

### Conclusion:
- `max_item_idx` is `n-1`.
- `pair_idx` could be `n-1` if no significant comparison occurs, or it could be some other index `i` where a significant comparison happens. Given the lack of specific details, we assume it remains `n-1`.

### Output:
Output: **! n-1 n-1 (where n-1 is the value of both max_item_idx and pair_idx)**
