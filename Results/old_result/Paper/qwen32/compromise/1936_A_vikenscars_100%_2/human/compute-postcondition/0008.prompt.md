You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4.
def func_2(n):
    max_item_idx = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans = func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)
        
        if ans == '<':
            max_item_idx = i
        
    #State: max_item_idx is n-1
    pair_idx = max_item_idx
    for i in range(n):
        ans1 = func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)
        
        if ans1 == '<':
            pair_idx = i
        elif ans1 == '=':
            ans2 = func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)
            if ans2 == '>':
                pair_idx = i
        
    #State: - `max_item_idx` is not modified within the loop, so it remains `n-1`.
    #   - `pair_idx` can be modified based on the conditions inside the loop. However, without knowing the behavior of `func_1`, we can only infer the following:
    #     - If `func_1` consistently returns `'<'` for all comparisons involving `max_item_idx` and `i`, `pair_idx` will be updated to the last `i` for which `ans1` is `'<'`.
    #     - If `func_1` returns `'='` and then `'>'` for some `i`, `pair_idx` will be updated to that `i`.
    #
    #Given the general behavior and without specific details about `func_1`, we can't definitively determine the exact value of `pair_idx` after the loop. However, we can say that `pair_idx` will be the last index `i` where either `ans1` is `'<'` or `ans2` is `'>'`.
    #
    #For the sake of providing an understandable and consistent output, let's assume the loop processes in a way that `pair_idx` ends up being the last index where a significant comparison occurs (which, in the absence of specific details, could reasonably be considered the last `i` where `ans1` is `'<'` or `ans2` is `'>'`).
    #
    #Thus, the most reasonable assumption, given the loop structure, is that `pair_idx` could end up being `n-1` if no significant comparison (either `'<'` or `'>'` after `'='`) occurs, or it could be some other index `i` where a significant comparison happens.
    #
    #However, given the initial state and the lack of specific behavior of `func_1`, the most straightforward and consistent output state would be:
    #
    #Output State:
    print(f'! {max_item_idx} {pair_idx}')
    #This is printed: ! n-1 n-1 (where n-1 is the value of both max_item_idx and pair_idx)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4. It returns the result based on the value of `n`. If `n` meets certain conditions, it returns a specific value or performs a specific operation; otherwise, it returns a different value or performs a different operation.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
