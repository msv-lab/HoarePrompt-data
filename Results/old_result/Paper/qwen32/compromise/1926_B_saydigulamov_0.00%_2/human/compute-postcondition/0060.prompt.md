You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the n x n grid. This is followed by n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one shape, which is either a triangle or a square, and this shape is composed of all the '1's in the grid. The size of the shape (k) is greater than 1, meaning the shape cannot consist of a single '1'.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)
        
    #State: `a` remains the initial input value, and `i` is equal to `a`. The list `k` is recalculated in each iteration but is only printed if `k[0]` equals `k[1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer representing the size of an n x n grid (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10). The grid is composed of n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one shape, which is either a triangle or a square, composed of all the '1's in the grid. The size of the shape (k) is greater than 1. The function returns "triangle" if the shape is a triangle and "square" if the shape is a square.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
