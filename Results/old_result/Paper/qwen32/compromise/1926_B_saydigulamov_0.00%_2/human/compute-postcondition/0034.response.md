Postcondition: **The input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer that is equal to the number of iterations that have already occurred; `b` is a string equal to the new user input. If the string `b` contains the digit '1', `k` has an additional element which is the count of '1's in `b`. If the string `b` does not contain the digit '1', `k` remains unchanged.**
