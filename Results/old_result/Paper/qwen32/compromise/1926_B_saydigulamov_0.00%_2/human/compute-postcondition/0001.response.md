In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range defined by the variable `a`, which represents the size of an n x n grid. The grid and its contents are not part of the loop head and therefore remain unchanged. The only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `a`.

To ensure that the loop can execute, `a` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts, as its value is set by the `range` function during each iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `a` is greater than 0.

State: **`a` is assigned the value of the first integer input, representing the size of the n x n grid, and `a` must be greater than 0**
