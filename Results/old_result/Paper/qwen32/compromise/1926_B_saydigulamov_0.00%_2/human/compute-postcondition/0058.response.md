To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and how the variables change during each iteration.

The loop iterates `a` times, where `a` is the size of the n x n grid. During each iteration, `k` is populated with the counts of '1's from the input strings `b` that contain at least one '1'. If `k[0]` equals `k[1]`, the list `k` is printed.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:

- `a` remains the same throughout the loop.
- `k` is recalculated in each iteration but is only printed if `k[0]` equals `k[1]`.
- The loop runs `a` times, so after all iterations, `i` will equal `a`.

Since the problem does not specify any changes to the grid or other variables outside of the loop, we can conclude that the final state of `a` and `i` will be `a` (the initial input value), and `i` will be equal to `a` after the loop completes. The list `k` will be recalculated in each iteration but will only be printed if the condition `k[0] == k[1]` is met during that iteration.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`a` remains the initial input value, and `i` is equal to `a`. The list `k` is recalculated in each iteration but is only printed if `k[0]` equals `k[1]`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `a` stays the same as the input value, and `i` will be equal to `a`. The list `k` is recalculated in each iteration but is only printed if the first and second elements of `k` are equal.
