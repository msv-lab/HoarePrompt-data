Postcondition: **`a` is assigned the value of the first integer input, representing the size of the n x n grid, and `a` must be greater than 0; `b` is the newly input string. If the string `b` contains the character '1', then `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in the string `b`. Otherwise, `k` remains an empty list.**
