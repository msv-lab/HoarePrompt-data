The value of `k` is decremented by `nums[0]`. Given that `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, `k` will be updated to `k - ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the rest of the `nums` list remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and `nums` is a list of length `n` where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and all other elements are `0`; `k` is updated to `k - ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`**.
