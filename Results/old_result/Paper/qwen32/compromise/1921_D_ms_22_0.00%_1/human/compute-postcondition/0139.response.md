Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)`; `item` is the tuple `(-difference, i, index)` that was the smallest in the heap, which corresponds to the largest `difference` value; `diff1` is `abs(i - b[tp1])`; `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`; `tp1` is increased by 1; `ans` is increased by `diff1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans` is now increased by `diff1`, while all other variables retain their previous states.
