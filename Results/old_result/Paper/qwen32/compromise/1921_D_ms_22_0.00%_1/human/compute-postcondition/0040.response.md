The code snippet provided increments the variable `ans` by the value of `diff1`. 

Based on the initial state, `ans` was initially 0. After executing the line `ans += diff1`, the new value of `ans` will be `diff1`.

The values of other variables such as `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `max_heap`, `item`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99; `n` and `m` are input integers; `a` is a non-empty list of integers; `b` is a sorted list of integers; `tp1` is `tp1 + 1`; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is `diff1`; `max_heap` is a heap of tuples `(-diff, i, j)` with the largest `diff` removed; `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, j)` that was removed from `max_heap`; `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1 - 1])`; `item[2]` is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`; `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`; and `diff1` is greater than `diff2`.**
