Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)` after the smallest element has been removed; `item` is the removed tuple `(-difference, i, index)` with the largest `difference`; `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`; `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`; `tp2` is decreased by 1; `ans` is increased by `diff2`.**

In natural language: The `max_heap` still contains at least one tuple after the smallest element has been removed. The `item` remains the removed tuple with the largest `difference`. The values of `diff1` and `diff2` remain unchanged, where `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. The variable `tp2` has been decreased by 1. The variable `ans` has been increased by the value of `diff2`.
