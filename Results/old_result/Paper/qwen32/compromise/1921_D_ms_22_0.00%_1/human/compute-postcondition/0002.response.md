The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100. Since `t` is within this range, it already satisfies the condition `t > 0` for the loop to execute. Therefore, no adjustment is needed.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100**
