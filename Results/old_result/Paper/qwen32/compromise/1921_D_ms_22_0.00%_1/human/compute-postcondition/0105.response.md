The code snippet `heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))` pushes a new tuple into the `max_heap`. This tuple consists of the negative of `diff2`, the value of `i`, and `m - 1`. The `max_heap` will now contain this new tuple in addition to its previous contents.

Given the initial state, the `max_heap` originally contained either `[(-diff1, i, 0)]` or `[(-abs(i - b[m - 1]), i, m - 1)]`. After the `heappush` operation, the `max_heap` will have an additional element `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`.

No other variables are modified by this operation, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`max_heap` contains either `[(-diff1, i, 0), (-diff2, i, m - 1)]` if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, or `[(-abs(i - b[m - 1]), i, m - 1), (-diff2, i, m - 1)]` if `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0; `t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers with at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `i` is the next element in the list `a`; `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`; `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`.**
