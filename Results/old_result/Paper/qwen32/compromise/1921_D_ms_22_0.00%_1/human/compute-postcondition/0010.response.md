The code snippet assigns the value of `m - 1` to the variable `tp2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99; `n` and `m` are input integers; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each split substring to an integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting a new input string, converting each split substring to an integer, and sorting the resulting list in ascending order; `max_heap` is an empty list; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`.**
