Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)` after the smallest element has been removed; `item` is the removed tuple `(-difference, i, index)` with the largest `difference`; `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`; `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`; `tp1` is incremented by 1.**

Natural language: The value of `tp1` is increased by 1, while the other variables `max_heap`, `item`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged.
