The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `b`. This operation does not affect any of the previously mentioned variables (`max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`).

Output State: **`max_heap` is empty, `tp1` and `tp2` have moved towards each other, `ans` contains the sum of the differences, `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input.**
