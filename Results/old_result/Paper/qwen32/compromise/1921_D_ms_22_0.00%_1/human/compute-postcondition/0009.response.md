The code snippet provided assigns the value `0` to the variable `tp1`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `max_heap` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99; `n` and `m` are input integers; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each split substring to an integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting a new input string, converting each split substring to an integer, and sorting the resulting list in ascending order; `max_heap` is an empty list; `tp1` is 0.**
