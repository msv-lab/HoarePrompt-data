The code snippet `heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))` pushes a new tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` onto the `max_heap`. This means the `max_heap` now contains one additional element, and its structure is updated accordingly to maintain the heap property.

The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `diff1`, `diff2`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is the addition of a new element to `max_heap`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`. `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` in addition to its previous contents. `i` is the next element in `a` after the current one.**
