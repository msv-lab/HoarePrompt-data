The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. This operation does not affect the values of `max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, or `m`. The new variable `a` is introduced and populated with the integers from the input.

Output State: **`max_heap` is empty, `tp1` and `tp2` have moved towards each other, `ans` contains the sum of the differences, `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
