Postcondition: **`max_heap` is empty, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`**
