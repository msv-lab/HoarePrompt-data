The code snippet provided is `max_heap = []`, which reinitializes `max_heap` to an empty list. This action does not affect any other variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`max_heap` is empty, `tp1` and `tp2` have moved towards each other, `ans` contains the sum of the differences, `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.**
