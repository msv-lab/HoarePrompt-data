Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)` (one less than before), `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 2`, `ans` is `ans + -item[0]`, `t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `item` is the tuple `(-difference, i, index)` that was the smallest in `max_heap`, and `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, but `item[2]` is not equal to `tp1`.**

In natural language: The value of `tp2` has been decremented by 1, so it is now `m - 2`. All other variables retain their previous values.
