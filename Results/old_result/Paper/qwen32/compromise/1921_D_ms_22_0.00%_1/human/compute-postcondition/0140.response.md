The code snippet provided is `tp2 -= 1`, which means the value of `tp2` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`max_heap`, `item`, `diff1`, and `diff2`) are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)`.
- `item` is the tuple `(-difference, i, index)` that was the smallest in the heap, corresponding to the largest `difference` value.
- `diff1` is `abs(i - b[tp1])`.
- `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`.

After executing `tp2 -= 1`, the value of `tp2` is decreased by 1. The value of `diff2` is dependent on `tp2`, so `diff2` will now be `abs(item[1] - b[tp2 - 1])`.

Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)`; `item` is the tuple `(-difference, i, index)` that was the smallest in the heap, which corresponds to the largest `difference` value; `diff1` is `abs(i - b[tp1])`; `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2 - 1])`; `tp2` is `tp2 - 1`.**
