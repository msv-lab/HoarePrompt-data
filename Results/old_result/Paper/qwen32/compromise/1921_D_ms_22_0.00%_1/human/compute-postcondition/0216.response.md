The `heapq.heappop(max_heap)` operation removes and returns the smallest element from the heap, which in this case is the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value (or equivalently, the largest `diff` value due to the negative sign used to simulate a max-heap using Python's min-heap implementation).

Given the initial state, after executing the line `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)`, the variable `item` will hold the tuple that was at the root of the heap, and the heap `max_heap` will no longer contain that tuple.

Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple in the form `(-diff, i, index)` after removing the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value, `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by `n`, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `item` is the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value that was removed from `max_heap`.**
