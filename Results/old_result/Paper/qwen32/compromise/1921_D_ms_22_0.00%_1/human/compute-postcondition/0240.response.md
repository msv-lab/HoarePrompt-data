Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple in the form `(-diff, i, index)` after removing the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value, `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by `n`, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `item` is the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value that was removed from `max_heap`, `ans` is increased by `-item[0]` (which is `diff`), `tp2` is decremented by 1.**

Natural language description: The value of `tp2` has been decreased by 1. All other variables retain their initial state and values, including `max_heap`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `item`, and `ans`.
