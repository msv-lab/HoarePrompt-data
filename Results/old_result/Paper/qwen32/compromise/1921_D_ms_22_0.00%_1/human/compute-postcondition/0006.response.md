The code snippet provided assigns a new list `b` to the variable `b`. This list is created by taking an input string, splitting it into substrings, converting each substring to an integer, and then collecting these integers into a list.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged. The new variable `b` is introduced and assigned the list of integers from the new input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99; `n` and `m` are input integers; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each split substring to an integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting a new input string and converting each split substring to an integer.**
