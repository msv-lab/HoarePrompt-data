The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. This operation does not affect the other variables provided in the initial state (`max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `m`), except for the introduction of the new variable `a`.

Given the initial state, the output state will include the newly created list `a` and will retain all other variables with their original properties and values.

Output State: **`max_heap` is empty, `tp1` and `tp2` are final pointers in `b`, `ans` is the total accumulated sum of the maximum distances, `t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
