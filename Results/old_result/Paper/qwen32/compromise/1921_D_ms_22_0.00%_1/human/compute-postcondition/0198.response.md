The code calculates the absolute difference between the second element of the tuple `item` (which is `item[1]`) and the element at index `tp1` in the list `b`. This value is then assigned to the variable `diff1`. The other variables (`max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `item`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_heap` contains tuples in the form `(-diff, i, index)` for each element `i` in `a`, except for the one that was popped; `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by `n`, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, index)` that was popped from `max_heap` and its `index` is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`; `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`.**
