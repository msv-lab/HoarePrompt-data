In the given `while` loop, the loop condition is `t > 0`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, the variable `t` must be greater than 0.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `max_heap` is empty
- `tp1` and `tp2` are final pointers in `b`
- `ans` is the total accumulated sum of the maximum distances

None of these states directly affect the loop condition `t > 0`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure that it is greater than 0.

State: **`max_heap` is empty, `tp1` and `tp2` are final pointers in `b`, `ans` is the total accumulated sum of the maximum distances, and `t` must be greater than 0**
