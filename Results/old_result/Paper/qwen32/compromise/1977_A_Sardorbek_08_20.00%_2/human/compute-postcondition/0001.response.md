The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` is greater than 0 because `range(a)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `a-1`. The state of `t`, `n`, `m`, and the specific values of the test cases do not affect the execution of this particular for loop directly, as they are not part of the loop head.

To ensure the loop executes, `a` must be at least 1. The value of `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range` function in the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; `a` is an integer such that `a` is greater than 0**
