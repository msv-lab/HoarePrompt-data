Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers derived from the input that must contain at least one element greater than its preceding element, `a` is either `l[x]` or the first element of the list `l`, `b` is either `l[x]` or the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element, `c` is 0, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element, and `y` must be less than `n-1`. The current value of `x` is such that `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`. If `l[x] - a` is greater than or equal to `l[x] - b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`.**
