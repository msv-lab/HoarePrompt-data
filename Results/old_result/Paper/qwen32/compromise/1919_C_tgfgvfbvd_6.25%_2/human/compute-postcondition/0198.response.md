Postcondition: **`l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is either the first element of `l` or the fifth element of `l` if `a` was originally greater than or equal to `l[4]`, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its predecessor (or 0 if no such element exists) or `l[4]` if `a` was less than `l[4]`, `c` is 1 if `l[4]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, otherwise `c` is 0, `y` is 0, and `n` is the length of the list `l`. `x` is 4.**
