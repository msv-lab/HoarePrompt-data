Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first element of `l`, `b` is `l[1]`, `c` is 0, `y` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables remain unchanged, but we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
