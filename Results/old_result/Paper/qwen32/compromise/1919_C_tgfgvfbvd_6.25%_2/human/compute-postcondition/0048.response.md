The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The values of `y`, `n`, `x`, `l`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`y` is such that `y + 1 < n`, `n` is greater than `y + 1`, `x` is `y + 2`. If `l[y + 2] - a >= l[y + 2] - b`, then `a` is `l[y + 2]`. Otherwise, `b` is `l[y + 2]`. `c` is increased by 1.**
