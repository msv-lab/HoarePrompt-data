Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers derived from the input, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `y` is 1. If `l[y]` (the second element of `l`) is greater than `l[y - 1]` (the first element of `l`), then `b` is the second element of the list `l` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables `a`, `b`, or `y`.**
