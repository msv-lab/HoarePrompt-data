The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `l`. This operation overwrites the previous value of `l`.

Given the initial state, `a`, `b`, and `c` are defined based on the sublist `l[y+1:n]`. However, since `l` is reassigned in the code snippet, the definitions of `a`, `b`, and `c` become irrelevant because they are based on the old `l` list which no longer exists.

Output State: **`l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a`, `b`, and `c` are undefined because their definitions depend on the old `l` list which has been overwritten.**
