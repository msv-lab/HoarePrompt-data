The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop continues as long as `x` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` was `y + 2`. For the loop to execute again, `x` should be incremented by 1.

Given the conditions:
- `y` is such that `y + 1 < n`
- `n` is greater than `y + 1`
- `x` is `y + 2`

At the start of the next iteration, `x` should be `y + 3`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`y` is such that `y + 1 < n`, `n` is greater than `y + 1`, and `x` is `y + 3`**.
