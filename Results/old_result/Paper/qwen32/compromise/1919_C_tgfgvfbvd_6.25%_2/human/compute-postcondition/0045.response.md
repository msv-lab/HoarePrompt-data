Given the initial state and the code snippet, we can determine the output state as follows:

Initial State: `y` is such that `y + 1 < n`, `n` is greater than `y + 1`, `x` is `y + 2`.

Code Snippet:
```python
a = l[x]
```

This line of code assigns the value of the element at index `x` in list `l` to the variable `a`. Since `x` is defined as `y + 2`, the value of `a` will be `l[y + 2]`.

No changes are made to the values of `y`, `n`, or `x`. The only new variable introduced is `a`, which takes the value of `l[y + 2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`y` is such that `y + 1 < n`, `n` is greater than `y + 1`, `x` is `y + 2`, `a` is `l[y + 2]`.**
