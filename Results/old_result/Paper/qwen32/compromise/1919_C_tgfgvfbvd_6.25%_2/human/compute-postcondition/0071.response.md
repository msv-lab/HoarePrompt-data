To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the initial state provided. However, the initial state does not contain any information about the variable `c`. Since there is no context or definition for `c`, it is impossible to determine its value based on the given information.

In such cases, if a variable is not defined or initialized before it is used, Python would raise a `NameError`. Therefore, the execution of the `print(c)` statement would result in an error rather than printing a specific value.

However, since the task asks for the output based on the provided information, and no information about `c` is available, we must conclude that the value of `c` is undefined in this context.

Output: **NameError: name 'c' is not defined**
