Postcondition: **`y` is such that `y + 1 < n`, `n` is greater than `y + 1`, and `x` is `y + 3`. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]` implies `a` is `l[y + 3]`; otherwise, `b` is `l[y + 3]`. If `l[x] >= a` or `l[x] >= b`, then `a` is `l[y + 3]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[y + 3]`; otherwise, `b` is `l[y + 3]`.**
