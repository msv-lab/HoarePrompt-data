#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

                break
        
        for x in range(y + 1, n):
            if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates and prints the number of elements in the list that are greater than both of the two most recently identified distinct elements (initially the first element and the first element greater than the first).
