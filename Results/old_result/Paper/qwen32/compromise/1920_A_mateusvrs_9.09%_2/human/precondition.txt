t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. Each of the following n lines contains two integers a and x where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. a = 1 means k must be greater than or equal to x. a = 2 means k must be less than or equal to x. a = 3 means k must be not equal to x. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2. No two constraints are the exact same.
