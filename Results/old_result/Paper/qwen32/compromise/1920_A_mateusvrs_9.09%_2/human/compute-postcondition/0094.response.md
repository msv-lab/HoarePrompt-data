Postcondition: **`ax` is the smallest value from inputs where `a == 2`; `bx` is the largest value from inputs where `a == 1`; `cx` is a set of all unique values from inputs where `a == 3` and contains at least one element; `bx` is less than `ax`; `i` is `i_new` where `i_new` is another element from `cx` that hasn't been processed yet; `tmp` is either 2 or 1. If `i` is between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), `tmp` is set to 2. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 1.**
