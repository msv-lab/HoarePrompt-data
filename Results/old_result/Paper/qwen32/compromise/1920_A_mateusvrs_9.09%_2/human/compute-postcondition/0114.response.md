The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `n`. Since `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop condition, the only state that needs adjustment is `n`.

Given that the loop will continue as long as `n` is greater than 0, and `n` is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `n` must be decremented by 1 from its current value.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `n` is greater than 0, meaning `n` could be any positive integer. After decrementing `n` by 1, `n` should still be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ax` is either 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000007` depending on whether `a` is not equal to 2. `bx` is `max(x, -1)` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1. `cx` is a set of all unique values from inputs where `a == 3`, and if `a` is not 2, `cx` includes the new value `x`. `r` contains `0` if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`; otherwise, `r` has a new element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` appended to it. `t` is decremented by 1. `n` is greater than 1. `a` and `x` are integers read from the input.**
