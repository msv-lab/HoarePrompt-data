The given code snippet adds the value of `x` to a set named `cx`. Since `cx` is not defined in the initial state, we assume that `cx` is a set that may or may not contain elements before this operation. After executing the code, `cx` will definitely include the value of `x`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `n` remains an integer between 1 and 99.
- `a` remains the first input integer.
- `x` remains the second input integer.
- `bx` remains the maximum of `x` and 0 if `a` was previously 1.
- `ax` remains the minimum of 1000000007 and `x` if `a` was previously 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007.
- `r` remains a list containing the single element `x` if `a` was not 1 or 2, `r` remains an empty list otherwise.
- `cx` now includes the value of `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer between 1 and 99, `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and 0 if `a` was previously 1, `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and `x` if `a` was previously 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007, `r` is a list containing the single element `x` if `a` was not 1 or 2, `r` is an empty list otherwise, `cx` includes the value of `x`.**
