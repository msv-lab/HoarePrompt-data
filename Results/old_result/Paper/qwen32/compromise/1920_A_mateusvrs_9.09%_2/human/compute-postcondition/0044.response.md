The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the elements in the set `cx`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `i` and how it changes as the loop progresses.

Given:
- `i` is currently `next_i` (the next element in `cx`).
- `cx` is a set containing at least one element.

At the start of each iteration, `i` takes on the value of the next element in `cx`. Therefore, to proceed to the next iteration, `i` should be updated to the subsequent element in `cx`.

Since sets are unordered collections, there isn't a specific order to the elements, but conceptually, we can think of `i` taking on the value of the "next" element in some arbitrary order defined by Python's internal representation of the set.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in `cx` after `next_i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `r` is an empty list, `ax` is the smallest `x` encountered when `a` was 2, `bx` is the largest `x` encountered when `a` was 1, `cx` is a set containing at least one element, `bx` is less than `ax`, `i` is the next element in `cx` after `next_i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is 2; otherwise, `tmp` remains 1.**
