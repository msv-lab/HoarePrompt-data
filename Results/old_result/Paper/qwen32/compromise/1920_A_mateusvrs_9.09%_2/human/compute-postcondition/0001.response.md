The given code snippet initializes an empty list `r`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or the constraints described by the pairs (a, x). Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the new variable `r`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; Each constraint is described by a pair of integers (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9; There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case; No two constraints are the same (all pairs (a, x) are distinct); `r` is an empty list.**
