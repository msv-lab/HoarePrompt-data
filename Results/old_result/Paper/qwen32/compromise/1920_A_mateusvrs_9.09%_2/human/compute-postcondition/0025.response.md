The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not plan to use inside the loop. Since the loop variable `_` does not affect the loop's continuation condition, we don't need to adjust it. The loop continues based on the value of `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` was the number of iterations left to perform. Since the loop iterates `n` times, at the start of each new iteration, `n` should be decremented by 1 to reflect the remaining iterations.

Given that `n` is initially between 2 and 100, after the first iteration, `n` should be `n - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer between 1 and 99, `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer. If `a` equals 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and 0, and `r` remains an empty list. If `a` equals 2, then `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`, and `r` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `ax` is 1000000007, and `r` is a list containing the single element `x`.**
