The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`. The values of `t`, `n`, `ax`, `bx`, `cx`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` must be greater than 0, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set, `r` is a list as defined previously, `a` is the first integer from the input, and `x` is the second integer from the input.**
