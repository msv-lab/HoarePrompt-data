The code snippet `ax = min(x, ax)` updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of its current value (which is 1000000007) and the value of `x`. Since `x` is the second integer from the input and `ax` is initially 1000000007, `ax` will be updated to `x` if `x` is less than 1000000007. Otherwise, `ax` remains 1000000007.

Given that `x` is the second integer from the input, the exact value of `x` is not specified here, but we know it will affect `ax` as described. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is greater than 0, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set, `r` is a list as defined previously, `a` is 2, and `x` is the second integer from the input.**
