To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `t` is 0.
- `n` is the number of constraints in the last iteration.
- `cx` is a set of unique `x` values from the last iteration where `a == 3`.
- `ax` is the minimum `x` from the last iteration where `a == 2`.
- `bx` is the maximum `x` from the last iteration where `a == 1`.
- `r` is a list of results from each iteration.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*r, sep='\n')
```

### Explanation:
The `print(*r, sep='\n')` statement unpacks the list `r` and prints each element of the list on a new line due to the `sep='\n'` argument.

Given the initial state, the only relevant piece of information for the print statement is the list `r`. Since the exact contents of `r` are not specified in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `r`.

### Output:
The output will be each element of the list `r` printed on a new line.

Output: **each element of the list `r` on a new line**
