Postcondition: **`ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is a set of all unique values from inputs where `a == 3`, `r` contains `0` if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`; otherwise, `r` has a new element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` appended to it, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` and `x` are the integers read from the input, `a` is not equal to 1, and currently `a` is 2.**
