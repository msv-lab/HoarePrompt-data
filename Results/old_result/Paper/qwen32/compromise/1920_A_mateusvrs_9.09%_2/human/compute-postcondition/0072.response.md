Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is decremented by 1, `r` is a list as defined previously, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` are calculated based on the value of `a` and `x`. If `a` equals 1, `bx` is the maximum of its previous value and `x`. If `a` equals 2, `ax` is the minimum value between `x` and the previous value of `ax`, and `bx` and `cx` are recalculated based on the value of `a` and `x`. Otherwise, `ax` and `bx` are recalculated based on the value of `a` and `x`, and `cx` includes `x` as one of its elements.**
