Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. The current implementation only counts the longest contiguous subarray of identical elements and attempts to use this to determine if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements, but it does not account for the specific conditions of the problem.

Here is a more detailed explanation of why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. The program calculates the length of the longest contiguous subarray of identical elements (`cnt`) and then tries to use this value to determine the answer. However, this does not correctly reflect the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to stop the array from being beautiful.

2. The program checks if the array length `n` is 1 or if the longest contiguous subarray length `ans` is equal to `n`. If either condition is true, it outputs `-1`, which is correct only for the case where all elements are the same (since no removal can make it non-beautiful). However, the check `ans == n` is not sufficient for all cases where the array is beautiful but can be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

3. The program does not correctly handle cases where the array has multiple segments of identical elements separated by different elements. For example, in the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program would incorrectly determine that the longest contiguous subarray of identical elements is of length 3, and thus output `3` when the correct answer is `3` (removing the first three elements).

To correctly solve the problem, a different approach is needed. One possible approach is to identify segments of identical elements and determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the beautiful property. This involves checking the structure of the array and ensuring that removing elements will indeed make it non-beautiful.
