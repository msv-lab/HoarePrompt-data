Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The program iterates through each test case, reads the array, and tries to find the smallest segment of consecutive equal elements. If the array consists of only one element or all elements are identical, it outputs -1 since it's impossible to make it stop being beautiful by removing elements. Otherwise, it outputs the length of the smallest segment of consecutive equal elements.

However, this approach is incorrect because the problem requires us to find the minimum number of elements to remove so that the array stops being beautiful, which means we need to consider the possibility of breaking the "beautiful" property by removing elements. The given program does not correctly address this requirement. It simply finds the smallest segment of consecutive equal elements, which is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of removals needed to break the beautiful property.

For example, in the fourth test case, the array is [3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]. The smallest segment of consecutive equal elements is of length 1 (the 5 in the middle), but removing just one element (the 5) does not make the array stop being beautiful. Instead, we need to remove at least three elements (the first three 3s) to break the beautiful property.

Correctness: **False**
