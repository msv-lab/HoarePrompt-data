### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its annotated version to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
The task is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. If it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful, the output should be `-1`.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by finding the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in the array. If the entire array consists of the same element, or if the array has only one element, it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it returns the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code's behavior:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `tmp` is set to the first element of the array.
   - `cnt` is initialized to `0` to count consecutive identical elements.
   - `ans` is initialized to `n` (the length of the array) to keep track of the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.

2. **Iteration:**
   - The code iterates through the array.
   - If the current element matches `tmp`, `cnt` is incremented.
   - If the current element does not match `tmp`, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, resets `cnt` to `0`, and updates `tmp` to the current element.

3. **Final Update:**
   - After the loop, `ans` is updated one last time to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.

4. **Decision:**
   - If `n == 1` or `ans == n` (which means all elements were the same), the array is already beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements, so the code returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `ans`.

#### Counterexample:
The original assessment provides a valid counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 2 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
- The array is beautiful because we can perform operations to make all elements the same.
- Removing one element (e.g., the middle `2`) makes the array `[1, 2, 1, 1]`, which is not beautiful because no operation can make all elements the same.

**Actual Output of the Code:**
```
-1
```

**Explanation of the Actual Output:**
- The code incorrectly determines that the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements. This is because the code's logic only considers the minimum length of consecutive identical elements, which is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beautiful property.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. The logic in the code is too simplistic and does not handle all cases correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
