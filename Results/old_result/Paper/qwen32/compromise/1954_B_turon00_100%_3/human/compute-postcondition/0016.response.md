The given code snippet is `ans = min(ans, cnt)`. This line updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `t` is the integer value provided by the input, 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the third input line.
- `tmp` is `a[0]`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

However, the values of `ans` and `cnt` are not provided in the initial state. To proceed, we assume that `ans` and `cnt` have been defined and hold some integer values prior to this line of code.

After executing `ans = min(ans, cnt)`, the value of `ans` will be updated to the smaller of its current value and the value of `cnt`.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the input, 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers provided by the third input line; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `i` is incremented by 1; `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.**
