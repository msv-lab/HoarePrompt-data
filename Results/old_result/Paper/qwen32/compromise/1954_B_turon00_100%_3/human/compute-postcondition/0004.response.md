The code snippet assigns the first element of the list `a` to the variable `tmp`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged except for the new assignment to `tmp`.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the input, 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is the integer value provided by the second input; `a` is a list of integers provided by the third input line; `tmp` is `a[0]`.**
