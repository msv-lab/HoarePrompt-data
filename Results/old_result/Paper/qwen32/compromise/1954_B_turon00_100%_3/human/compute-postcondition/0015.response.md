Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the input, 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers provided by the third input line; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `i` is incremented by 1; `cnt` is incremented by 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `cnt` is increased by 1, while all other variables retain their previous values.
