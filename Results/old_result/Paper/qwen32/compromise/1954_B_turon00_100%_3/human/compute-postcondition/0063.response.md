The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. This operation does not affect the values of `ans`, `cnt`, `n`, or `t`. 

Given the initial state, the values of `ans`, `cnt`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged. The new variable `a` is introduced and is a list of integers obtained from the input.

Output State: **`ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `n` equals 1 or `ans` equals `n`, no further changes are made to `ans` and `n`. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`. `t` is 2; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
