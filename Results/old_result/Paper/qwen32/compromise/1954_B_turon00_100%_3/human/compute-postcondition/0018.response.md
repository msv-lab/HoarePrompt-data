Postcondition: **`t` is the integer value provided by the input, 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers provided by the third input line; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` equals `tmp`, `cnt` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, and `cnt` is reset to 0.**
