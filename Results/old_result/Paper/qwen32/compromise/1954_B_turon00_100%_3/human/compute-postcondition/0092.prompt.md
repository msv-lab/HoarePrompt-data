Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value provided by the input, 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 3 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    tmp = a[0]
    cnt = 0
    ans = n
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == tmp:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if n == 1 or ans == n:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the integer value provided by the input, 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is the length of the list `a`; `a` is the list of integers provided by the third input line; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `cnt` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` if the loop ends with such a sequence, otherwise 0; `ans` is the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. Additionally, either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n` or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `n` equals 1 or `ans` equals `n`, no further changes are made to `ans` and `n`. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`; `t` is 2; `n` is the input integer; `a` is the input list of integers; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `cnt` is 0 unless the last elements of `a` are all equal to `tmp`, in which case `cnt` is the count of these elements. Additionally, either `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
