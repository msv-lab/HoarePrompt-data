Postcondition: **`t` is the integer value provided by the input minus 1, where 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is the new list of integers provided by the third input line; `tmp` is `a[0]`. If `a[i]` equals `tmp`, `cnt` is incremented by 1 (i.e., `cnt` becomes 3 if it was 2, 2 if it was 1, or 1 if it was 0), and `ans` is set to `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is set to 0 and `ans` is set to the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`. Additionally, either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n` or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`; `i` is `t + 2`.**
