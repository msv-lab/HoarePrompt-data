The code snippet provided resets the variable `cnt` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `i`, `ans`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the input, 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers provided by the third input line; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `i` is incremented by 1; `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`; `cnt` is 0.**
