The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is `n`, `t` is 2, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is `a[0]`, and `cnt` is 1.

Output State: **`ans` is `n`, `t` is 2, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is 1**.
