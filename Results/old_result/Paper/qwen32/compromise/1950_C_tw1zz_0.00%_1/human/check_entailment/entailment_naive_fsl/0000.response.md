Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the conversion of 24-hour time to 12-hour time for all edge cases. Specifically, the program incorrectly converts midnight ("00:00") to "12:00 PM" instead of "12:00 AM". Additionally, the program does not handle leading zeros correctly for hours 1 through 9 in the 12-hour format.

Here is a specific example of the incorrect behavior:

- **Input:** `00:00`
- **Expected Output:** `12:00 AM`
- **Actual Output:** `12:00 PM`

To fix this, the program should be modified to correctly handle the conversion of "00:00" to "12:00 AM" and ensure that hours 1 through 9 are output with a leading zero in the 12-hour format.

Here is a corrected version of the function for reference:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h12 = 12
            time = 'AM'
        elif h < 12:
            h12 = h
            time = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            h12 = 12
            time = 'PM'
        else:
            h12 = h - 12
            time = 'PM'
        print(f"{h12:02}:{m:02} {time}")

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version ensures that "00:00" is converted to "12:00 AM", and it maintains the correct format for all other times.
