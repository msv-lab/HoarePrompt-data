### Reasoning:

The provided program appears to be correctly implementing the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Sorting Monsters by Distance**: The program sorts the monsters based on their absolute distance from the character. This ensures that monsters closer to the character are considered first, which is a reasonable strategy to maximize the chances of survival.

2. **Bullet Calculation**: The program calculates the total number of bullets needed to kill each monster and checks if this total exceeds the maximum number of bullets that can be fired before the monster reaches the character (`distance * k`). This is done correctly by maintaining a running total of bullets used (`bullets_used`) and comparing it with the maximum allowed bullets for each monster.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases well, such as when the number of bullets needed to kill a monster exceeds the maximum allowed before it reaches the character. In such cases, the program correctly sets `can_survive` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Multiple Test Cases**: The program processes multiple test cases as required, ensuring that the logic is applied independently to each test case.

### Testing with Example Inputs:

Let's verify the program with the provided example inputs to ensure it works correctly.

#### Example 1:
```
3 2
1 2 3
-1 2 3
```
- Monsters: `(-1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)`
- Sorted by distance: `(-1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)`
- Bullets needed: `1, 2, 3`
- Maximum bullets allowed: `1*2, 2*2, 3*2` (2, 4, 6)
- Total bullets used: `1, 3, 6` (all within limits)
- **Output: YES**

#### Example 2:
```
2 1
1 1
-1 1
```
- Monsters: `(-1, 1), (1, 1)`
- Sorted by distance: `(-1, 1), (1, 1)`
- Bullets needed: `1, 1`
- Maximum bullets allowed: `1*1, 1*1` (1, 1)
- Total bullets used: `1, 2` (exceeds limit for second monster)
- **Output: NO**

#### Example 3:
```
4 10
3 4 2 5
-3 -2 1 3
```
- Monsters: `(-3, 3), (-2, 4), (1, 2), (3, 5)`
- Sorted by distance: `(-2, 4), (1, 2), (-3, 3), (3, 5)`
- Bullets needed: `4, 2, 3, 5`
- Maximum bullets allowed: `2*10, 1*10, 3*10, 3*10` (20, 10, 30, 30)
- Total bullets used: `4, 6, 9, 14` (all within limits)
- **Output: YES**

#### Example 4:
```
5 3
2 1 3 2 5
-3 -2 3 4 5
```
- Monsters: `(-3, 2), (-2, 1), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 5)`
- Sorted by distance: `(-2, 1), (3, 3), (-3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 5)`
- Bullets needed: `1, 3, 2, 2, 5`
- Maximum bullets allowed: `2*3, 3*3, 3*3, 4*3, 5*3` (6, 9, 9, 12, 15)
- Total bullets used: `1, 4, 6, 8, 13` (all within limits)
- **Output: YES**

#### Example 5:
```
2 1
1 2
1 2
```
- Monsters: `(1, 1), (2, 2)`
- Sorted by distance: `(1, 1), (2, 2)`
- Bullets needed: `1, 2`
- Maximum bullets allowed: `1*1, 2*1` (1, 2)
- Total bullets used: `1, 3` (exceeds limit for second monster)
- **Output: NO**

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all the provided examples and edge cases. The logic implemented is sound and matches the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
