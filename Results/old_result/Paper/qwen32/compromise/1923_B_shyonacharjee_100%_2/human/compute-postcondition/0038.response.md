Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `x` is a list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the elements in `x`; `bullets_used` is 0; `can_survive` is True.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `can_survive` has been explicitly set to `True`. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
