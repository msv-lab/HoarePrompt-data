Postcondition: **`pos` is `next_pos`; `health` is `next_health`; `distance` is `abs(next_pos)`; `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, `can_survive` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `can_survive` or the loop continues.**
