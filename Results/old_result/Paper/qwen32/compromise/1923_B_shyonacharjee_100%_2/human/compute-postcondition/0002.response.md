The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state only specifies that `t` is an input integer within a specific range, and this value is not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input**.
