Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `x` is a list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the elements in `x` and must contain at least two tuples; `pos` and `health` are the values from the next tuple in `monsters`; `bullets_used` is increased by `health`; `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, then `can_survive` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without changing `can_survive`.**

Natural Language: The value of `bullets_used` is increased by the value of `health`. The value of `total_bullets_needed` is updated to be the sum of `bullets_used` and `health`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
