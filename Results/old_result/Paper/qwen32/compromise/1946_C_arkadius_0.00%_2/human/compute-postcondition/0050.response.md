The code snippet provided updates the `remaining_size` attribute of `tree.vertices[v]` by adding the `remaining_size` of `tree.vertices[u]` to it. 

Given the initial state, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is incremented by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.

Output State: **`v` is a valid vertex in `tree`, `tree.vertices[v].children` is a non-empty list, `postorder` is `True`, `stack` has one less element and is not empty if it had more than one element before popping, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components`, `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.**

In natural language: The `remaining_size` of vertex `v` in the tree is now the sum of its previous `remaining_size` and the `remaining_size` of vertex `u`. All other conditions and states remain unchanged.
