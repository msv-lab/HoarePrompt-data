Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer input, and `1 <= k < n`; `tree` is an instance of `Tree` initialized with `n` nodes and includes an edge between nodes `u-1` and `v-1` for each of the `n-1` pairs read from the input; `i` is `n-1`.**

**Natural Language Explanation:** After all iterations of the loop have finished, the `tree` will include an edge between nodes `u-1` and `v-1` for each of the `n-1` pairs of integers read from the input. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, meaning it will execute `n-1` times, adding exactly `n-1` edges to the tree. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states, with `k` still satisfying the condition `1 <= k < n`.
