Output State: **`v` is a valid vertex in `tree`, `tree.vertices[v].children` is a non-empty list, `postorder` is `True`, `stack` has one less element and is not empty if it had more than one element before popping, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is further incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`, `u` is the next child in `tree.vertices[v].children`. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is now `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.**

In simpler terms, the `remaining_size` of vertex `v` is updated by adding the `remaining_size` of vertex `u` to it. All other conditions and states remain the same.
