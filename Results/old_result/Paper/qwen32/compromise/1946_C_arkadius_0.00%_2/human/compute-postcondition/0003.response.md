The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the list `[u, v]`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, or `tree`. The only change is that `u` and `v` are now assigned the values from the input.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer input, and `1 <= k < n`; `tree` is an instance of `Tree` initialized with `n` nodes; `u` and `v` are the two integers read from the input.**
