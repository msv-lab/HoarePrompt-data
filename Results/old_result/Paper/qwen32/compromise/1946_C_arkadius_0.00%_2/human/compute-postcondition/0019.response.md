To determine the final state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the binary search implemented in the loop. The loop is searching for the maximum value of `mid` such that `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns `True`.

The loop continues to execute as long as `beg < end`. In each iteration, `mid` is calculated as `(beg + end + 1) // 2`. If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is `True`, `beg` is updated to `mid`; otherwise, `end` is updated to `mid - 1`.

The loop will terminate when `beg` is no longer less than `end`. At this point, `beg` will be equal to the largest value for which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns `True`.

Given that the loop has already executed 3 times and the values of `beg` and `end` have been adjusted accordingly, the loop will continue to execute until `beg` equals `end`.

The final state of the loop will be when `beg` and `end` converge to a single value, which is the maximum `mid` for which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns `True`.

Let's denote the final converged value as `final_value`. The final state of the variables `beg` and `end` will both be `final_value`.

Output State: **`tree` is an object representing a tree with `n` vertices, where `n` is greater than 1; `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n; `beg` is `final_value` and `end` is `final_value`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the loop has finished executing, and both `beg` and `end` have converged to the same value, which is the largest `mid` for which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns `True`.
