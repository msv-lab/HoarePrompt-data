Postcondition: **`tree` is an object representing a tree structure where each vertex has a list of children and attributes `good_components` and `remaining_size`. `postorder` is `True`. `stack` remains unchanged. `v` remains unchanged. `u` is the next element in `tree.vertices[v].children`. `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one element. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of its previous value, `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of its previous value and `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the sum of its previous value and `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.**
