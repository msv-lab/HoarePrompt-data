Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tree` is an object representing a tree structure where each vertex has a list of children and attributes `good_components` and `remaining_size`. The current value of `postorder` is `True`. `stack`, `v`, and `postorder` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
    if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
        tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
    else:
        tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tree` is an object representing a tree structure where each vertex has a list of children and attributes `good_components` and `remaining_size`. The `good_components` of `tree.vertices[v]` has been increased by the `good_components` of `tree.vertices[u]`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `good_components` of `tree.vertices[v]` is further increased by 1. `postorder` is `True`. `stack` remains unchanged. `v` remains unchanged. `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one element. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to the sum of its previous value and `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tree` is an object representing a tree structure where each vertex has a list of children and attributes `good_components` and `remaining_size`. The `good_components` of `tree.vertices[v]` has been increased by the `good_components` of `tree.vertices[u]`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `good_components` of `tree.vertices[v]` is further increased by 1. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to the sum of its previous value and `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`. `postorder` is `True`. `stack` remains unchanged. `v` remains unchanged. `u` is the next element in `tree.vertices[v].children`. `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tree` is an object representing a tree structure where each vertex has a list of children and attributes `good_components` and `remaining_size`. `postorder` is `True`. `stack` remains unchanged. `v` remains unchanged. `u` is the next element in `tree.vertices[v].children`. `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one element. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of its previous value, `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of its previous value and `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the sum of its previous value and `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
