Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the provided problem description, program code, and annotations.

### Problem Understanding
The task is to find the maximum number \( x \) such that after removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree with \( n \) vertices, each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.

### Program Analysis

#### Tree Structure
- The `Tree` class is defined with `TreeNode` objects representing each vertex.
- Each `TreeNode` stores edges, children, subtree size, parent, good components, and remaining size.
- The `Tree` class has methods to add edges and root the tree non-recursively.

#### Functions
1. **`func_1`**:
   - Performs an iterative postorder traversal using a stack.
   - Updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex.
   - Correctly accumulates `good_components` and `remaining_size` based on the children of each vertex.

2. **`func_2`**:
   - Recursive version of the postorder traversal.
   - Updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` similarly to `func_1`.
   - This function is not used in the final execution but is provided for completeness.

3. **`func_3`**:
   - Uses `func_1` to determine if it's possible to have more than `k` good components or exactly `k` good components with the remaining size being at least `x`.
   - Returns `True` if the conditions are met, otherwise `False`.

4. **`func_4`**:
   - Implements a binary search to find the maximum \( x \).
   - Uses `func_3` to check if a given \( x \) is feasible.
   - Adjusts the search range based on the result of `func_3`.

5. **`func_5`**:
   - Reads input, constructs the tree, roots the tree, and prints the result of `func_4`.

### Annotations and Validation
- **`func_1`**: The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function call. The stack is used to perform a postorder traversal, and the `good_components` and `remaining_size` are correctly updated.
- **`func_2`**: Similar to `func_1`, the annotations correctly describe the state and behavior.
- **`func_3`**: The annotations correctly describe the logic for checking if the conditions are met for a given \( x \).
- **`func_4`**: The annotations correctly describe the binary search process to find the maximum \( x \).
- **`func_5`**: The annotations correctly describe the process of reading input, constructing the tree, and finding the result.

### Edge Cases
- The program handles the edge case where \( k \) is 1 and \( n \) is 2 correctly.
- It also handles cases where \( k \) is close to \( n \) and where \( k \) is small.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the solution to the problem using a binary search approach and postorder traversal to evaluate the tree. The annotations validate the correctness of each function and the overall logic.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
