You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Output

    1 1
    1 1
    
Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
After carefully reviewing the provided program, I have identified several issues that prevent it from meeting the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Incomplete Implementation**: The program lacks a definition for `res_dict`, `arr`, `res`, and `start_index`. These variables are used in the functions but are not defined anywhere in the provided code. This makes the program incomplete and unable to run as intended.

2. **Logical Errors**: The `make_stairs` function modifies the global `arr` array directly but does not ensure that the changes align with the problem requirements. The function also does not handle cases where the array segment is already in the desired form correctly.

3. **Missing Output**: The program does not generate the required output format. It should output the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the sequence of operations. The program does not return or print these values.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases such as arrays with all elements being the same, arrays with a single element, or arrays with all elements being zero.

5. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**: The program does not correctly calculate the MEX of a subarray, which is crucial for determining the optimal operations to maximize the sum.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

**Correctness: False**.

### Explanation of Why the Program is Incorrect:
- **Incomplete Code**: The program is missing necessary variable definitions (`res_dict`, `arr`, `res`, `start_index`).
- **Logical Errors**: The `make_stairs` function does not correctly handle all cases and modifies the array improperly.
- **Missing Output**: The program does not generate the required output format.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle various edge cases effectively.
- **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**: The program does not correctly calculate the MEX of subarrays, which is essential for determining the optimal operations.
