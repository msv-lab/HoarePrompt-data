### Reasoning:

The given program is supposed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of an array by performing a series of operations where each operation sets a subarray to the MEX (minimum excluded value) of that subarray. The program uses two main functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to compute the maximum possible sum and the sequence of operations to achieve that sum, respectively.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: Computes the maximum possible sum of the array segment from `start_index` to `end_index`.
- **Logic**:
  - If the segment is a single element, it returns the maximum of 1 and the element itself.
  - For longer segments, it considers all possible ways to split the segment into smaller parts and computes the maximum sum recursively.
  - It also considers the scenarios where the first or last element of the segment is included in the sum.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: Constructs the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
- **Logic**:
  - If the segment is a single element, it returns an operation to set the element to 1 if it is 0.
  - For longer segments, it determines which sub-segment split or which element inclusion yields the maximum sum and recursively constructs the operations for those sub-segments.
  - It also handles the case where the entire segment can be set to a sequence of consecutive integers (a "staircase").

#### Function `make_stairs`:
- **Purpose**: Constructs the operations needed to transform a segment into a "staircase" (a sequence of consecutive integers starting from 0).
- **Logic**:
  - Recursively checks if the segment is already a staircase.
  - If not, it performs the necessary operations to set the segment to a staircase.

### Evaluation:
- The program's logic for computing the maximum sum (`func_1`) and constructing the operations (`func_2`) seems to be correct based on the problem description.
- The use of memoization in `func_1` helps in optimizing the recursive calls.
- The `make_stairs` function correctly constructs the operations to achieve a staircase, which is a key part of maximizing the sum.
- The program correctly handles edge cases such as single-element arrays and arrays with all elements already being the MEX.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correctly implemented based on the provided logic and examples. It computes the maximum sum and constructs a valid sequence of operations to achieve that sum.

**Correctness: True**
