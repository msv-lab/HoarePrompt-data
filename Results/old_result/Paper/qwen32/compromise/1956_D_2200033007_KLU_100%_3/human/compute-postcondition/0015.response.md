The code snippet appends a tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` to the list `res`. The values of `i`, `start_index`, and `is_already_stairs` remain unchanged. The other preconditions about the array `arr` and the function `make_stairs` are also still valid.

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer representing an index in the array `arr`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer representing the starting index of the subarray in `arr` that the function is currently processing, `is_already_stairs` is `False`, indicating that not all elements in the subarray from `arr[start_index]` to `arr[start_index + i]` satisfy `arr[start_index + j] == j` for all `j` in the range from `0` to `i`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0. The element `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`. The function `make_stairs` has been called with the argument `i - 1`. The list `res` now includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`.**
