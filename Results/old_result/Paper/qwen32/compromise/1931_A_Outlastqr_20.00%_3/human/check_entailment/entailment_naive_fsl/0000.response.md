Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap
- We need to determine the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded as a sum of the positions of its characters in the alphabet.
- The input is an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing the encoded word.
- The output should be the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded to `n`.

### Provided Program Analysis
The program uses the following logic:
- For `n > 52`, it constructs the word as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
- For `52 ≥ n > 26`, it constructs the word as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
- For `n ≤ 26`, it constructs the word as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

### Checking the Logic
Let's verify if this logic covers all potential cases correctly.

1. **Case 1: n > 52**
   - The formula `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'` is used.
   - This means the first letter is determined by `n - 53`, and the last two letters are 'z'.
   - For `n = 53`, the word would be `'a' + 'zz' = 'azz'`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 78`, the word would be `'z' + 'zz' = 'zzz'`, which is correct.

2. **Case 2: 52 ≥ n > 26**
   - The formula `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'` is used.
   - This means the first letter is 'a', the second letter is determined by `n - 28`, and the last letter is 'z'.
   - For `n = 27`, the word would be `'a' + 'a' + 'z' = 'aaz'`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 52`, the word would be `'a' + 'z' + 'z' = 'azz'`, which is correct.

3. **Case 3: n ≤ 26**
   - The formula `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]` is used.
   - This means the first two letters are 'a', and the third letter is determined by `n - 3`.
   - For `n = 3`, the word would be `'aa' + 'a' = 'aaa'`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 26`, the word would be `'aa' + 'z' = 'aaz'`, which is correct.

### Testing Edge Cases
Let's test some edge cases to ensure the program works correctly:
- **n = 3**: `'aaa'` (correct)
- **n = 26**: `'aaz'` (correct)
- **n = 27**: `'aaz'` (correct, but should be `'aay'` as 'aaz' is not lexicographically smallest for `n=27`)
- **n = 52**: `'azz'` (correct, but should be `'ayz'` as 'azz' is not lexicographically smallest for `n=52`)
- **n = 53**: `'azz'` (correct)
- **n = 78**: `'zzz'` (correct)

### Conclusion
The program does not handle some cases correctly. For example:
- For `n = 27`, the correct output should be `'aay'` instead of `'aaz'`.
- For `n = 52`, the correct output should be `'ayz'` instead of `'azz'`.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation
The program fails to generate the lexicographically smallest word for certain values of `n`, particularly when `n` is such that the constructed word is not the smallest possible.
