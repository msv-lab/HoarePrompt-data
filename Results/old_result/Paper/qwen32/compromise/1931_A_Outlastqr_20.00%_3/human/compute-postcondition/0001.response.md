In the provided for loop, the loop will execute based on the value provided by the user input. The loop head only contains the variable `i` and the range function, which depends on the input value. The variables `t`, `n`, and `alphabet` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

To ensure the loop executes, the input provided to the `range` function must be at least 1. Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect that the input value will be at least 1.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `alphabet` is a string containing the lowercase English alphabet, and the input value must be at least 1**.
