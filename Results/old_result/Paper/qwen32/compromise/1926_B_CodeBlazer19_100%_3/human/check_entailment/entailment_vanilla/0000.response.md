Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
- We need to identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square.
- A triangle has `2*i - 1` ones in the `i-th` row, centered around a vertical axis.
- A square has `k` ones in each of `k` consecutive rows, starting from the same column.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = 0
        b = ''
        for j in range(n):
            s = input()
            if s.count('1') == 1:
                a = 'TRIANGLE'
            elif s.count('1') > 1:
                b = 'SQUARE'
        if a != 0:
            print(a)
        else:
            print(b)
```

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` is the size of the grid.
   - `a` is initialized to `0`, and `b` to an empty string.

2. **Processing Each Row**:
   - For each row `j` in the grid:
     - If the count of `1`s in the row (`s.count('1')`) is `1`, it sets `a` to `'TRIANGLE'`.
     - If the count of `1`s in the row is greater than `1`, it sets `b` to `'SQUARE'`.

3. **Decision Making**:
   - After processing all rows, if `a` is not `0` (meaning there was at least one row with exactly one `1`), it prints `'TRIANGLE'`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `'SQUARE'`.

#### Issues in the Program:
- The program incorrectly identifies a triangle if any row has exactly one `1`. This does not correctly capture the structure of a triangle as defined in the problem.
- The program does not check the alignment or symmetry of the `1`s across multiple rows, which is crucial for identifying both triangles and squares.
- The program does not handle upside-down triangles correctly.
- The logic for determining squares is flawed because it only checks if there is more than one `1` in a row, without ensuring that all rows have the same number of `1`s starting from the same column.

### Conclusion:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to distinguish between a triangle and a square based on the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
