You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
- We need to identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square.
- A triangle has `2*i - 1` ones in the `i-th` row, centered around a vertical axis.
- A square has `k` ones in each of `k` consecutive rows, starting from the same column.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = 0
        b = ''
        for j in range(n):
            s = input()
            if s.count('1') == 1:
                a = 'TRIANGLE'
            elif s.count('1') > 1:
                b = 'SQUARE'
        if a != 0:
            print(a)
        else:
            print(b)
```

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` is the size of the grid.
   - `a` is initialized to `0`, and `b` to an empty string.

2. **Processing Each Row**:
   - For each row `j` in the grid:
     - If the count of `1`s in the row (`s.count('1')`) is `1`, it sets `a` to `'TRIANGLE'`.
     - If the count of `1`s in the row is greater than `1`, it sets `b` to `'SQUARE'`.

3. **Decision Making**:
   - After processing all rows, if `a` is not `0` (meaning there was at least one row with exactly one `1`), it prints `'TRIANGLE'`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `'SQUARE'`.

#### Issues in the Program:
- The program incorrectly identifies a triangle if any row has exactly one `1`. This does not correctly capture the structure of a triangle as defined in the problem.
- The program does not check the alignment or symmetry of the `1`s across multiple rows, which is crucial for identifying both triangles and squares.
- The program does not handle upside-down triangles correctly.
- The logic for determining squares is flawed because it only checks if there is more than one `1` in a row, without ensuring that all rows have the same number of `1`s starting from the same column.

### Conclusion:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to distinguish between a triangle and a square based on the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
