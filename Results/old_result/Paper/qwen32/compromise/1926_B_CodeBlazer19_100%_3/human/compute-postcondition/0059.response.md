Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer provided by user input, where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). This represents the number of test cases.
2. `i` is initialized to 1.
3. `n` is the input integer for the current test case.
4. `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' if the last string `s` contains exactly one '1'. Otherwise, it retains its previous value.
5. `b` is set to 'SQUARE' if any string `s` contains more than one '1'. Otherwise, it is an empty string.
6. `j` is initialized to `n-1`.
7. `a` is not equal to 0 (which implies `a` is a non-zero value, and given the context, it's a string).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `a` is the only one being printed.
- According to the initial state, `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' if the last string `s` contains exactly one '1'.
- Since there is no explicit information about the strings `s` or their contents, we can't definitively say if `a` was ever set to 'TRIANGLE' or retained its previous value.
- However, we know that `a` starts with a non-zero value and can only be set to 'TRIANGLE' under specific conditions related to the content of the string `s`.

Given the constraints and the information provided, the most precise description we can give is that `a` could either be 'TRIANGLE' if the last string `s` contained exactly one '1', or it could retain its previous value if this condition was not met.

### Conclusion:
Without knowing the exact content of the strings `s`, we cannot determine the exact value of `a` beyond the fact that it is influenced by the presence of '1's in the strings `s`.

Output: **a (where a is 'TRIANGLE' if the last string s contains exactly one '1', otherwise it retains its previous value)**
