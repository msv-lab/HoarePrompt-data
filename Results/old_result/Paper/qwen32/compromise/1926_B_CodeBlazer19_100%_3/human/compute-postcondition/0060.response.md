Let's analyze the given precondition and if condition to determine the postcondition when the if condition is not met.

### Precondition:
- `t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100)
- `i` is 1
- `n` is the input integer
- `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if the last string `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise it retains its previous value
- `b` is 'SQUARE' if any string `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise it is ''
- `j` is `n-1`

### If Condition:
```python
if (a != 0):
```

### Analysis:
The if condition checks whether `a` is not equal to 0. Since `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or retains its previous value, and these are strings, the condition `a != 0` will always be true because a non-empty string is never equal to 0. However, since we are asked to consider the case where the if condition is not met, we need to think about what would make this condition false. 

For the if condition `(a != 0)` to be false, `a` would have to be `0`. But since `a` can only be 'TRIANGLE' or retain its previous value (which would not be 0), there seems to be a misunderstanding in the problem statement. Given the context, let's assume the intention was to check if `a` is an empty string or not.

However, based on the given precondition, `a` can only be 'TRIANGLE' or retain its previous value, which means it will never be 0. Therefore, the only way to satisfy the negation of the if condition is to assume `a` could theoretically be an empty string (though it doesn't match the precondition).

Given the problem constraints, let's assume the intention was to check if `a` is not 'TRIANGLE'. Thus, the negation would mean `a` is not 'TRIANGLE'.

### Postcondition:
Since the if condition is not met, `a` must not be 'TRIANGLE'. Therefore, `a` retains its previous value, which means it is not 'TRIANGLE'.

Postcondition: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `a` is not 'TRIANGLE', `b` is 'SQUARE' if any string `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise it is '', and `j` is `n-1`**
