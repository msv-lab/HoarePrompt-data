Postcondition: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string provided by user input. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` does not contain any '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` remains an empty string.**
