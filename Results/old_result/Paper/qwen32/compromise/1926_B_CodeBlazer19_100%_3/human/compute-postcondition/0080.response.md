Postcondition: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is the new user's input, `a` and `b` are set based on the new `s`: if `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is `'TRIANGLE'` and `b` is `''`; if `s` contains more than one '1', `a` is `0` and `b` is `'SQUARE'`; if `s` does not contain any '1', `a` is `0` and `b` is `''`. Additionally, if `s` contains more than one '1', `b` is specifically set to `'SQUARE'`. `j` is 3.**
