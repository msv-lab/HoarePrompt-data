The given code snippet sets the variable `a` to 0. This means that regardless of its previous value, `a` will now be 0. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `b`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is 1, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE' if at least one input string `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise `b` is an empty string, and `j` is `n-1`.**
