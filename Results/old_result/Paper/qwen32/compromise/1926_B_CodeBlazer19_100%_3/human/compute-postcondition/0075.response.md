Postcondition: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is the user's input. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is set to `'TRIANGLE'` and `b` remains an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', `a` is 0 and `b` is set to `'SQUARE'`. If `s` does not contain any '1', `a` is 0 and `b` remains an empty string.**
