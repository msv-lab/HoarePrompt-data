Postcondition: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string provided by user input. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is ''. Otherwise, `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE' if `s` contains more than one '1', or `b` remains an empty string if `s` does not contain any '1's. `j` is 0 in all cases.**
