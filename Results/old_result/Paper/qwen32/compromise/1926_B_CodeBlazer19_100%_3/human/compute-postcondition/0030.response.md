Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer provided by user input, where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). This represents the number of test cases.
2. `i` is initialized to 0.
3. `n` is an input integer, presumably the length of a string `s` for each test case.
4. `a` is initialized to 0 because no input string `s` contains exactly one '1'.
5. `b` is set to 'SQUARE' if at least one input string `s` contains more than one '1'. Otherwise, `b` remains an empty string.
6. `j` is initialized to `n-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b)
```

### Analysis:
The key variable here is `b`. According to the initial state, `b` is either 'SQUARE' or an empty string depending on the content of the input strings `s`.

- If any of the input strings `s` contains more than one '1', then `b` is set to 'SQUARE'.
- If none of the input strings `s` contain more than one '1', then `b` remains an empty string.

However, the initial state mentions that `a` is 0 because no input string `s` contains exactly one '1'. This implies that all input strings `s` either do not contain any '1's or contain more than one '1'. Therefore, `b` must be 'SQUARE'.

### Conclusion:
Given the conditions, `b` will be 'SQUARE' because it's stated that no input string `s` contains exactly one '1', meaning at least one string must contain more than one '1'.

Output: **SQUARE**
