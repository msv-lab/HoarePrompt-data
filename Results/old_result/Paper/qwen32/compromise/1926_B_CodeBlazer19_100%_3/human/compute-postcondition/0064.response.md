The code snippet provided reassigns the value of `n` to a new integer input from the user. This means the previous value of `n` is overwritten. The values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if the last string `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise it retains its previous value, `b` is 'SQUARE' if any string `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise it is '', and `j` is `n-1`.**
