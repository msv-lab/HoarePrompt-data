The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `a`. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `b`, and `j`). Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE' if any string `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise it is '', and `j` is `n-1`.**
