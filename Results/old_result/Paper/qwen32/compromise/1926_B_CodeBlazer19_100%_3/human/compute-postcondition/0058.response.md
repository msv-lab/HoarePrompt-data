Postcondition: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if the last string `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise it retains its previous value, `b` is 'SQUARE' if any string `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise it is '', and `j` is `n-1`. Additionally, `a` is not equal to 0.**
