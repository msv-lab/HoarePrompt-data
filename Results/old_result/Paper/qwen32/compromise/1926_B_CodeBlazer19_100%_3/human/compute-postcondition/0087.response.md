Postcondition: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100); `i` is 2; `n` is greater than or equal to 4; `s` is the new user's input; `j` is 4; `a` and `b` are determined based on the new value of `s`: if `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is `'TRIANGLE'` and `b` is `''`; if `s` contains more than one '1', `a` is `0` and `b` is `'SQUARE'`; if `s` does not contain any '1', `a` is `0` and `b` is `''`.**
