The code snippet sets the variable `b` to an empty string. This does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, or `j`. Therefore, the only change is that `b` is now an empty string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is 1, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is 0, `b` is '', and `j` is `n-1`.**
