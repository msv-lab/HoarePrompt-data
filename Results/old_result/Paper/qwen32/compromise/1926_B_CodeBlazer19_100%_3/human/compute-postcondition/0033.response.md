The code snippet `n = int(input())` reassigns the variable `n` to a new integer value provided by user input. This means the previous value of `n` is overwritten by the new input value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is 1, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if at least one input string `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE' if at least one input string `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise `b` is an empty string, and `j` is `n-1`.**
