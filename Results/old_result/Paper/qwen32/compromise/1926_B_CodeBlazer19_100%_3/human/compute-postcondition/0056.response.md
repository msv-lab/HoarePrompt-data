Postcondition: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100); `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 1; `s` is a new string provided by user input; `j` is 2. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' and `b` remains as per the initial conditions based on the previous value of `s`. If `s` contains more than one '1', `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain as per the initial conditions based on the previous value of `s`.**
