Postcondition: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is 0, `s` is the user's input, and the count of '1' in `s` is not equal to 1. If the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. Otherwise, `b` remains an empty string.**
