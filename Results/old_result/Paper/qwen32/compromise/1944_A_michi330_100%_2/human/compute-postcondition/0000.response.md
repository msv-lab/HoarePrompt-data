The code snippet provided only reads the number of test cases `t` from the input. It does not affect the values of `n` and `k` or any other variables related to the test cases themselves. The values of `n` and `k` are described in the precondition and will be read in subsequent lines of code, which are not provided here.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` and `k` are as described in the precondition for each test case.**
