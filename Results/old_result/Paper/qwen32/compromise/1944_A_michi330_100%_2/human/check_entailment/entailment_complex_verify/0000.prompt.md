You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and k (0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2) representing the number of islands and the maximum number of bridges Dominater can destroy, respectively.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)
        
    #State: `t` is unchanged, `n` and `k` are undefined after the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of islands (`n`) and the maximum number of bridges (`k`) that can be destroyed. For each test case, it outputs `1` if the number of bridges that can be destroyed is at least `n - 1`; otherwise, it outputs `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the problem correctly for all cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of islands Everule can visit is flawed.

The program currently checks if `k >= n - 1` and if true, it prints `1` (meaning Everule can only visit island 1). If `k < n - 1`, it prints `n` (meaning Everule can visit all islands). However, this logic does not consider the optimal way Dominater can destroy bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit.

For example, consider the test case `n = 4` and `k = 2`. According to the program, it would print `n = 4` because `k < n - 1` (2 < 3). However, Dominater can destroy two bridges in such a way that Everule can only visit 2 islands. One way to do this is to destroy the bridges between island 1 and island 2, and island 1 and island 3. In this case, Everule can only visit island 1 and island 4 (if there is a bridge between island 3 and island 4, Everule can still visit island 4 via island 3).

Thus, the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of islands Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.
