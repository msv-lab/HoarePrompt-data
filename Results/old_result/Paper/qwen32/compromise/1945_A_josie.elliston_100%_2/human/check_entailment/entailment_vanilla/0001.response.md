Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Introverts (a)**: Each introvert needs a tent to themselves. So, `a` tents are needed for introverts.
2. **Extroverts (b)**: Each extrovert needs a tent with exactly two other people. So, `b` extroverts require `ceil(b/3)` tents (since each tent can accommodate 3 people).
3. **Universals (c)**: Universals can be placed in any tent.

The key requirement is that extroverts must always be in tents with exactly two other people. This means if we have `b` extroverts, the number of people they need to be with is `2*b`. These `2*b` people can be filled by introverts and universals.

- If `2*b > a + c`, it is impossible to accommodate all extroverts according to their wishes, and we should output `-1`.
- Otherwise, after placing `a` introverts in their own tents, we need to place the remaining `2*b - a` people in tents with extroverts. The remaining people can be universals. We then need to calculate the number of tents required for these groups.

### Solution Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - It first checks if `extroverts % 3 != 0`. If true, it means extroverts cannot be perfectly grouped into tents of 3.
   - It then checks if the remaining extroverts and universals can fill up the last tent. If `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it returns `None`, indicating it's impossible to accommodate the remaining extroverts.
   - Otherwise, it returns `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`, which is the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the total number of tents required.
   - It first calls `func_1` to get the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1`, indicating it's impossible to accommodate all participants.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of tents required for introverts (`introverts`) and the tents required for extroverts and universals (`ret`).

### Testing the Solution:

Let's walk through the first test case `1 2 3`:
- `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `c = 3`
- `func_1(2, 3)` calculates `ceil((2 + 3) / 3) = 2`. This is because 2 extroverts need 1 tent, and the remaining 3 people (1 introvert + 2 universals) can fill up the second tent.
- `func_2(1, 2, 3)` returns `1 + 2 = 3`, which is correct.

Let's walk through the second test case `1 4 1`:
- `a = 1`, `b = 4`, `c = 1`
- `func_1(4, 1)` calculates `None` because `4 % 3 != 0` and `4 % 3 + 1 < 3`.
- `func_2(1, 4, 1)` returns `-1`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly handles the constraints and requirements of the problem. It correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed or determines if it's impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

**Correctness: True**
