Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2*m + 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a new defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` and `end` are the values read in the last iteration and have been decremented, `inc` is -1, `m` is the input integer, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration.**

Natural Language: The value of `n` has been updated to the integer value provided by the input. All other variables retain their previous values.
