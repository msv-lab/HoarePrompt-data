The code snippet `start -= 1` decrements the value of `start` by 1. Given the initial state, `start` was already calculated as the new value read from the input minus 1. Therefore, after executing the code, `start` will be the original input value minus 2.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `d1` and `d2` are defaultdicts with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` is the new value read from the input minus 2, `end` is the new value read from the input minus 1, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 0. If `start` is less than `end`, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**
