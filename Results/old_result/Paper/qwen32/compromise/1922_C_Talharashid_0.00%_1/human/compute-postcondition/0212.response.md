Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 0 to `end - 1`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values and `d2[0] = s`, `d2[-1] = s`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with at least one element, `start` is -1, `end` is 1, `inc` is -1, `m` is the total number of iterations, `mini` remains unchanged. If `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[-1] - lst[-2])`.**
