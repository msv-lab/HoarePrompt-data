Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `start` is `end - 1`, and `mini` is updated to `min(mini, abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]))`**

Natural Language: The value of `mini` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
