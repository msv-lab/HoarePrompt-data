To ensure that the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the states of `start` and `end` such that the condition `start != end` is true.

Given the state right before the `while` loop:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `i` is 0
- `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values
- `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values
- `n` is an input integer
- `lst` is a list of integers
- `start` is `len(lst) - 1`
- `end` is 0
- `inc` is -1
- `s` is 0
- `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration

The loop condition is `start != end`. For the loop to execute, `start` and `end` must have different values. Given the initial state, `start` is `len(lst) - 1` and `end` is `0`. 

If `lst` is not empty (which is a reasonable assumption since `start` is `len(lst) - 1`), then `start` will be at least `0` when `lst` has one element. However, to ensure that `start` is not equal to `end` (which is `0`), `lst` must have more than one element. 

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `lst` has more than one element, ensuring that `start` is not equal to `end`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with more than one element, `start` is `len(lst) - 1`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration**
