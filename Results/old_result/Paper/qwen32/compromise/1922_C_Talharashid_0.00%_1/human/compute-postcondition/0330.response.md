The `while` loop condition is `start != end`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `start` is not equal to `end`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `start` is `len(lst) - 3` and `len(lst) >= 2`
- `end` is `0`

For the loop to execute one more time, `start` must not be equal to `end`. Since `end` is `0`, we need to ensure that `start` is not `0`. Given that `start` is `len(lst) - 3`, we need to ensure that `len(lst) - 3` is not `0`.

This implies that `len(lst)` must be greater than `3` to ensure that `start` is not `0`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `len(lst) > 3`.

State: **`t` remains the same (an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4); `i` remains the same (2*m + 1); `d1` will have keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding values of `s` calculated in each iteration; `d2` now has a new key-value pair where the key is `start` and the value is `s`; `n` remains the same (input integer); `lst` remains the same (list of integers read from the input) and `len(lst) > 3`; `end` is 0; `inc` is now -1; `m` remains the same (input integer); `start` is `len(lst) - 3` and `len(lst) >= 2`; `mini` is `min(11111111, s, abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]))` if `start - 1 > -1`, otherwise `mini` is `min(11111111, s)`; if `mini` equals the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, then `s` is the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` plus 1, otherwise `s` is `2 * abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.**
