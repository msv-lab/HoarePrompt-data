The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `start` and `end`. This operation does not affect the other variables except for `start` and `end`, which are updated based on the input.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `i`, `d1`, `d2`, `n`, `lst`, `inc`, `m`, `s`, and `mini` remain unchanged. The only variables that are affected are `start` and `end`.

Since `start` and `end` are decremented by 1 in the initial state, the new values of `start` and `end` will be the values read from the input minus 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is m, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 0 to `end - 1`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values and `d2[start] = s` for each `start` from `len(lst) - 1` to 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` and `end` are the values read from the input and have been decremented by 1 again, `inc` is -1, `m` must be greater than 0, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration. If `start` was less than `end`, then `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**
