Postcondition: **`t` remains the same (an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4); `i` remains the same (2*m + 1); `d1` will have keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding values of `s` calculated in each iteration; `d2` remains unchanged (a new defaultdict with default int values); `n` remains the same (input integer); `lst` remains the same (list of integers read from the input); `end` is 0; `inc` is now -1; `m` remains the same (input integer); `start` is `len(lst) - 1`; `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` (or 11111111 if `start - 1` is not greater than -1); `s` is 0; and `mini` equals the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`.**
