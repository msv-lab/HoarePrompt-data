Output State: **`t` remains the same, `i` is 1, `d1` will have keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding values of `s` calculated in each iteration, `d2` will have keys from `len(lst) - 1` to `1` with corresponding values of `s` calculated in each iteration, `n` remains the same, `lst` remains the same, `end` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `inc` is -1, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is the first integer from the input minus 1, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, `s` is 0, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`. If `start` is less than `end`, `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. If `start` is not less than `end`, `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**

In natural language: The value of `s1` is now calculated as the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
