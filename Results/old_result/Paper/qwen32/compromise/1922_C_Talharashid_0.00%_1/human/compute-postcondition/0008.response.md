The code snippet provided initializes a variable `inc` with the value `1`. This does not affect any of the other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state will reflect this new variable `inc` and retain all other variables with their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `start` is 0, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1.**
