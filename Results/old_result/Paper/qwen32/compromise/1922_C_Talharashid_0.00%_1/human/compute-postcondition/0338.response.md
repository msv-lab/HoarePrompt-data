Postcondition: **`t` remains the same (an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4); `i` remains the same (2*m + 1); `d1` will have keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding values of `s` calculated in each iteration; `d2` now has a new key-value pair where the key is `start` and the value is `s`; `n` remains the same (input integer); `lst` remains the same (list of integers read from the input) and `len(lst) > 3`; `end` is 0; `inc` is now -1; `m` remains the same (input integer); `start` is `len(lst) - 3` and `len(lst) >= 2`. If `mini` equals the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, then `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`.**
