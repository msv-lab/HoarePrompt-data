To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the state such that the condition `start != end` is satisfied. The variables `start` and `end` are the only ones that can be adjusted according to the loop head.

Given:
- `start` is 0.
- `end` is `len(lst) - 1`.

For the loop to execute, `start` must not be equal to `end`. This means `len(lst) - 1` must not be 0, implying `len(lst)` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `lst` has more than one element. 

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2*m + 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a new defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `end` is len(lst) - 1 (which is at least 1), `inc` is 1, `m` is the input integer, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, `start` is 0**
