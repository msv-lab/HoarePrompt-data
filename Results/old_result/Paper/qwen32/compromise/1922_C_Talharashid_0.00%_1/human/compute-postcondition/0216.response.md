Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 0 to `end - 1`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values and `d2[start] = s` for each `start` from `len(lst) - 1` to 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` is 0, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `m` is the input integer, `s` is the final cumulative value after all iterations, and `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration.**

In this output state, the value of `m` has been updated to the input integer provided by the user. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
