The provided code snippet is:
```python
start = len(lst) - 1
```
This line of code reassigns the value of the variable `start` to be the length of the list `lst` minus one.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `i` is 0
- `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values
- `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values
- `n` is an input integer
- `lst` is a list of integers
- `start` is `len(lst) - 1`
- `end` is `len(lst) - 1`
- `inc` is 1
- `s` is the final cumulative sum after all iterations
- `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration

The only variable that is affected by this line of code is `start`, which is reassigned to `len(lst) - 1`. However, since `start` was already initialized to `len(lst) - 1` in the initial state, the value of `start` does not change.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` is `len(lst) - 1`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `s` is the final cumulative sum after all iterations, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration.**
