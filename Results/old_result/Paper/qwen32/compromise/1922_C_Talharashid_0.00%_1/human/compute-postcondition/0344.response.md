The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `start` and `end`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the values of `t`, `i`, `d1`, `d2`, `n`, `lst`, `inc`, `m`, and `mini` stay the same. The value of `s` is also not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `i` is 0, `d1` will have keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding values of `s` calculated in each iteration, `d2` will have keys from `len(lst) - 1` to `1` with corresponding values of `s` calculated in each iteration, `n` remains the same, `lst` remains the same, `end` is the second integer from the input, `inc` is -1, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is the first integer from the input, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, `s` is the accumulated value based on the conditions described**.
