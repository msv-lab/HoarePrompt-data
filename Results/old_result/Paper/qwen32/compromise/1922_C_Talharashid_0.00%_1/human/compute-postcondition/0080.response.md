The code snippet calculates the minimum value between the absolute difference of `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and the current value of `mini`. Given the initial state, `mini` is initially set to 11111111. The new value of `mini` will be the smaller of its current value and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]`.

Since the exact values of `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` are not provided, we can only express the new value of `mini` in terms of these elements. Therefore, the new value of `mini` will be `min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), 11111111)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values and `d2[start]` is `s`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with more than one element, `start` is `len(lst) - 3`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, and `mini` is `min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), 11111111)`**.
