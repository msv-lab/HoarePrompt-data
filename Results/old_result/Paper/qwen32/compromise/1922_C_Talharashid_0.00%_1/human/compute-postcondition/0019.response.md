The given code snippet only modifies the variable `s` by incrementing its value by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change for `s`, while the rest of the variables will retain their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `s` is 1. If `start` is greater than 0, then `mini` is the minimum of 11111111, `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`. Otherwise, `mini` remains the minimum of 11111111 and `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`. The current value of `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.**
