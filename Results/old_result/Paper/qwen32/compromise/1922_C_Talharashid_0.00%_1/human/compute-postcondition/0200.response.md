The code snippet `s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` updates the value of `s` by adding the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` to the current value of `s`. 

Given the initial state, `start` is 0 and `inc` is -1. Therefore, `lst[start + inc]` translates to `lst[0 - 1]` which is `lst[-1]`. 

So, `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[0] - lst[-1])`.

Let's put this in the output state format:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 0 to `end - 1`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values and `d2[0] = s`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with at least one element, `start` is 0, `end` is 1, `inc` is -1, `m` is the total number of iterations, `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[0] - lst[-1])`.**

In natural language, the value of `s` is now the original value of `s` plus the absolute difference between the first and last elements of the list `lst`. All other variables retain their initial values.
