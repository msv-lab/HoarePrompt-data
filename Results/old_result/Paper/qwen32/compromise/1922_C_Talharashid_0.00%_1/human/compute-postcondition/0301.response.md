The code snippet `end = 0` sets the variable `end` to 0. This change does not affect any other variables in the given initial state. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains the same (an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4); `i` remains the same (2*m + 1); `d1` will have keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding values of `s` calculated in each iteration; `d2` remains unchanged (a new defaultdict with default int values); `n` remains the same (input integer); `lst` remains the same (list of integers read from the input); `end` is 0; `inc` remains the same (1); `m` remains the same (input integer); `start` is now `end` (len(lst) - 1); `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration; `s` is the accumulated value based on the differences calculated in each iteration.**
