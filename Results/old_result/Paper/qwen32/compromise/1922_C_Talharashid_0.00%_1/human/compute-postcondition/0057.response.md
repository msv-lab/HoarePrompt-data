Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with more than one element, `start` is `len(lst) - 1` and `start - 1 > -1`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, and `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111.**

In simpler terms, the postcondition states that all the initial conditions remain the same, with the additional information that `start` is greater than 0, meaning there is at least one element before the current `start` position in the list `lst`.
