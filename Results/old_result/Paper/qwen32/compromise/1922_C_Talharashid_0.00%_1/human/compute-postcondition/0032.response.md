The code snippet `s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` updates the value of `s` by adding the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `i` is 0
- `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start]` is `s`
- `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values
- `n` is an input integer
- `lst` is a list of integers with at least two elements
- `end` is `len(lst) - 1`
- `inc` is 1
- `start` is `end - 1`
- If `start - 1 > -1`, `mini` is updated to `min(mini, abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]))`. Otherwise, `mini` retains its initial value.

The value of `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start]` is `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `start` is `end - 1`. If `start - 1 > -1`, `mini` is updated to `min(mini, abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]))`. Otherwise, `mini` retains its initial value.**
