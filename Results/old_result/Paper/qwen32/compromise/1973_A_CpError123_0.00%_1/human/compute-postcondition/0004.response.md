Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases (with 1 <= t <= 500), and `cas_de_test`, a list of `t` tuples. Each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` (with 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) representing the scores of three players in each test case. The function returns a list `resultats` of integers, where each integer corresponds to the number of matches that ended in a draw for each test case in `cas_de_test`. If no matches ended in a draw, the integer is `-1`.**
