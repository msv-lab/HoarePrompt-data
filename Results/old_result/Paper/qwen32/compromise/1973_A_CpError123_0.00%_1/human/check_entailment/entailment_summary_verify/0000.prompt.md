You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]
resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))

def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
    return resultats



- Function Summary: 
The function takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list `cas_de_test` of `t` tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the scores of three players. It returns a list `resultats` of integers, where each integer is either `-1` or a non-negative integer indicating the number of matches that ended in a draw for each test case. If the conditions for a valid number of draws are not met, `-1` is returned for that test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as per the problem description. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Matches**:
   - The program calculates `total_matchs` as `total_points // 2`, which is correct because each match contributes 2 points (either 2 for a win and 0 for a loss, or 1+1 for a draw).
   - However, the condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:` is incorrect. The condition `total_matchs > 3` is not valid because there can be more than 3 matches if there are multiple games between the same pairs of players.
   - The condition `p3 > total_matchs` is also incorrect because `p3` can be greater than `total_matchs` if there are multiple games and draws.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Draws**:
   - The formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` is incorrect. This formula does not correctly account for the distribution of wins and draws.
   - The correct approach involves checking the possible number of draws directly by simulating the games and ensuring that the points can be distributed correctly.

Let's consider a specific case where the program fails:

**Test Case**:
```
1
0 2 4
```

**Expected Output**:
```
2
```

**Explanation**:
- Total points = 0 + 2 + 4 = 6
- Total matches = 6 // 2 = 3
- Possible distribution: Two draws (each contributing 2 points) and one loss/win pair (contributing 2 points).
- Draws = 2

However, the given program will likely output `-1` for this case because the formula for `egalites` does not correctly account for the distribution of points.

Given this analysis, the program is incorrect for at least one potential case, so the correctness is False.
