Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains several logical errors and does not correctly handle the conditions described in the problem statement. Let's go through the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Total Matches**: The line `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:` is incorrect. The total number of matches is not limited to 3, and `p3 > total_matchs` is also not a valid condition for invalid scores.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Draws**: The formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` is incorrect. It does not correctly compute the maximum number of draws based on the scores provided.

3. **Logic for Valid Scores**: The logic to determine if the scores are valid and to compute the maximum number of draws is flawed. The program does not correctly account for the possible scenarios where the scores could be achieved, especially when considering the constraints of the problem.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_games = total_points // 2
        
        # Check if the scores are valid
        if p1 + p2 < p3:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of draws
        max_draws = min(total_games - (p3 - p2), total_games - (p3 - p1), p2 - p1)
        if max_draws < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(max_draws)
    return resultats
```

This corrected version properly checks the validity of the scores and calculates the maximum number of draws based on the constraints provided in the problem statement.
