Let's go through the reasoning step-by-step to determine if the provided program is correct based on the problem description:

1. **Total Points Calculation**: The sum of the scores (`p1 + p2 + p3`) must be even because each game results in a total of 2 points being awarded (either 2-0 or 1-1). If the total points are odd, it's impossible to distribute them according to the rules, and the program correctly appends `-1` to the results.

2. **Total Matches Calculation**: The total number of matches played is `total_points // 2`. This is because each match contributes 2 points to the total score.

3. **Maximum Possible Matches**: The program checks if the total number of matches exceeds 3. This is incorrect. The maximum number of matches between three players is not limited to 3. For example, if each pair of players plays multiple matches, the total number of matches can be greater than 3. Therefore, this check should be removed or modified.

4. **Individual Player Score Constraints**: The program checks if `p3 > total_matchs`. This check is also incorrect. Player 3's score can be greater than the total number of matches if player 3 wins multiple matches against the other two players. This check should be removed or modified.

5. **Calculating Draws**: The program calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. This formula is intended to account for the points awarded to the players and subtract the points that would have been awarded in wins (2 points per win). However, the formula is incorrect. A correct approach would be to first determine the number of wins and then calculate the number of draws based on the remaining points.

6. **Final Check for Draws**: The program checks if `egalites < 0`. If it is, it appends `-1` to the results, indicating an invalid score distribution. If not, it appends `egalites // 2` to the results, which is incorrect because `egalites` should already represent the number of draws, not twice the number of draws.

Given these points, the program is not correct. Here are some specific examples where the program would fail:

- For the input `(0, 2, 3)`, the program would incorrectly determine the number of draws as `-1` because of the incorrect formula and checks.
- For the input `(1, 1, 10)`, the program would incorrectly determine the number of draws as `2` when it should be `-1` because it's impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules.

**Correctness: False**
