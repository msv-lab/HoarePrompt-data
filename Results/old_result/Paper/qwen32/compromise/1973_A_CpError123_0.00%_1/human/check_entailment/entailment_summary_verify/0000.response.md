Let's analyze the provided code and the function summary in detail to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
The task is to find the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the scores of three players, under the constraints that:
- Each game results in 2 points being distributed (either 2 to the winner, or 1 to each in case of a draw).
- The total points for the three players are given and sorted in non-decreasing order.
- If the scores are not achievable through a valid set of games, the result should be `-1`.

### Analysis of the Code
The provided code attempts to solve the problem with the following logic:

1. **Calculate Total Points and Matches:**
   - `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`
   - `total_matchs = total_points // 2`
   - If `total_points` is odd, the scores are invalid, and the function returns `-1`.

2. **Constraints on Total Matches and Scores:**
   - The condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:` is incorrect. The maximum number of matches is not limited to 3, and `p3` can be greater than `total_matchs` if there are multiple games and draws.

3. **Calculate Draws:**
   - The formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` is incorrect. This formula does not correctly account for the distribution of wins and draws.

### Correct Approach
To correctly determine the maximum number of draws:
- We need to consider the constraints of the problem more carefully.
- A valid approach involves checking if the scores can be achieved by a combination of wins and draws.

### Specific Issues in the Code
Let's consider the specific test case mentioned in the original assessment:

**Test Case:**
```
1
0 2 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- Total points = 0 + 2 + 4 = 6
- Total matches = 6 // 2 = 3
- Possible distribution: Two draws (each contributing 2 points) and one loss/win pair (contributing 2 points).
- Draws = 2

The provided code will likely output `-1` for this case because the formula for `egalites` does not correctly account for the distribution of points.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases. The logic for calculating the number of draws is flawed, and the constraints on `total_matchs` and `p3` are incorrectly applied.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect for at least one potential case, so the correctness is False.
