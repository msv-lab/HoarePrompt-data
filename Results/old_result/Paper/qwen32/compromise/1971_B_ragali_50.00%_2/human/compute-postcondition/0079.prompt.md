Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, and for each test case, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    s = input().strip(' ')
    a = set()
    for i in s:
        a.add(i)
    if len(a) > 1:
        print('YES')
        newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
        isreverse = s[::-1]
        if newstr != s:
            print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
        elif isreverse != s:
            print(isreverse)
        else:
            print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `s` is a string that is the input stripped of leading and trailing spaces; `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the string `s`. If the length of `a` is greater than 1, `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s`; `isreverse` is the reverse of the string `s`. If `newstr` is not equal to `s`, then `s` is not a palindrome. Otherwise, `s` is a palindrome. If the length of `a` is 1 or less, the string `s` consists of the same character repeated.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `s` is a non-empty string; `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the string `s`; `i` is the last character in the string `s`. If the length of `a` is greater than 1, `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s`. If `newstr` is equal to `s`, then `s` is a palindrome, and `isreverse` is equal to `s`; otherwise, `isreverse` is not equal to `s`. If the length of `a` is 1, then the length of the set `a` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `s` is a non-empty string; `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the string `s`; `i` is the last character of the string `s`. If the length of `a` is greater than 1, `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s`, and `isreverse` is the string `s` reversed. If `newstr` is not equal to `s`, then `newstr` is not equal to `s`; otherwise, `newstr` is equal to `s` and `isreverse` is equal to `s` if `s` is a palindrome, or `isreverse` is not equal to `s` if `s` is not a palindrome. If the length of `a` is 1, the length of `a` remains 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
