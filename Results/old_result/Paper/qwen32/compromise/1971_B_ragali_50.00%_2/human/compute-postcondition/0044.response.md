Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `s` is a non-empty string; `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the string `s` and the length of `a` is greater than 1; `i` is the last character in the string `s`; `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s`; `isreverse` is the reversed string of `s`; `newstr` is equal to `s`; `isreverse` is not equal to `s`**
