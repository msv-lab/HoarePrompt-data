The code snippet `a.add(i)` adds the current character `i` to the set `a`. Given the initial state, `a` already contains the value of `i` after it was incremented, and `i` is the next character in the string `s`. After executing the code, `a` will contain the new character `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character; `a` is a set containing the value of `i` after it was incremented and the new character `i`; `i` is the next character in the string `s`.**
