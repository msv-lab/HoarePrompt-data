Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `s` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing spaces; `a` is an empty set; If the length of `a` is greater than 1, `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s`; `isreverse` is the reverse of the new string `s`. If `newstr` is not equal to `s`, then `s` is not a palindrome. Otherwise, `s` is a palindrome. If the length of `a` is 1 or less, the string `s` consists of the same character repeated; `i` is `i + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    a.add(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `s` is a non-empty string; `a` is a set containing the value of `i` after it was incremented; `i` is `i + 1`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character; `a` is a set containing the value of `i` after it was incremented and the new character `i`; `i` is the next character in the string `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character; `a` is a set containing unique characters from the string `s` up to and including `i`; `i` is the subsequent character in the string `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
