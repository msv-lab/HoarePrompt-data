The code snippet adds the next character in the string `s` after its current value to the set `a`. This means that the set `a` will now include the new value of `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000.
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `a` is a set containing the previous value of `i` and the new value of `i`.
- `i` is the next character in the string `s` after its current value.

After the execution of `a.add(i)`, the set `a` will have the new value of `i` added to it. The values of `t`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `a` is a set containing the previous value of `i` and the new value of `i`, `i` is the next character in the string `s` after its current value.**
