Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The first element `t` in the list represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the list contains an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing stick lengths. The function returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique stick length by 4.**
