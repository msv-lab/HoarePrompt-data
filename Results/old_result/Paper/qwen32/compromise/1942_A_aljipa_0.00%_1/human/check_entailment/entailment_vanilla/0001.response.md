Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Sorted Array:** An array is sorted if each element is less than or equal to the next element.
2. **Cyclic Shift:** A cyclic shift of an array involves rotating the array. For example, the cyclic shifts of `[1, 2, 3, 3]` are `[1, 2, 3, 3]`, `[2, 3, 3, 1]`, `[3, 3, 1, 2]`, and `[3, 1, 2, 3]`.
3. **Objective:** Given `n` and `k`, find an array of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted. If no such array exists, return `-1`.

### Test Cases:
1. **n = 2, k = 2:** The array `[1, 1]` or any array where all elements are the same satisfies this condition because all cyclic shifts will be sorted.
2. **n = 3, k = 1:** The array `[69420, 69, 420]` satisfies this condition because only the first cyclic shift `[69420, 69, 420]` is sorted.
3. **n = 3, k = 2:** No such array exists because if two cyclic shifts are sorted, the array must have some regularity that would likely make more than two shifts sorted.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program handles three specific cases:
1. **k = n:** The program returns an array of `n` ones (`[1, 1, ..., 1]`). This is correct because all cyclic shifts of this array will be sorted.
2. **k = 1:** The program returns the array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`. This is correct because only the first cyclic shift will be sorted.
3. **k ≠ 1 and k ≠ n:** The program returns `-1`. This is correct because, as shown in the test case `n = 3, k = 2`, no such array exists.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all specified cases and returns valid results based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
