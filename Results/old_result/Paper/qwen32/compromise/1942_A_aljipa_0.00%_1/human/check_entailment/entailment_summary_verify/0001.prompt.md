You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        res = [1] * n if k == n else range(n) if k == 1 else [-1]
        print(*res)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3). It then prints a list of `n` ones if `k` equals `n`, a list of the first `n` non-negative integers if `k` equals 1, and a list with a single element `-1` if `k` is neither `n` nor `1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Sorted Array:** An array is sorted if each element is less than or equal to the next element.
2. **Cyclic Shift:** A cyclic shift of an array involves rotating the array. For example, the cyclic shifts of `[1, 2, 3, 3]` are `[1, 2, 3, 3]`, `[2, 3, 3, 1]`, `[3, 3, 1, 2]`, and `[3, 1, 2, 3]`.
3. **Objective:** Given `n` and `k`, find an array of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted. If no such array exists, return `-1`.

### Test Cases:
1. **n = 2, k = 2:** The array `[1, 1]` or any array where all elements are the same satisfies this condition because all cyclic shifts will be sorted.
2. **n = 3, k = 1:** The array `[69420, 69, 420]` satisfies this condition because only the first cyclic shift `[69420, 69, 420]` is sorted.
3. **n = 3, k = 2:** No such array exists because if two cyclic shifts are sorted, the array must have some regularity that would likely make more than two shifts sorted.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program handles three specific cases:
1. **k = n:** The program returns an array of `n` ones (`[1, 1, ..., 1]`). This is correct because all cyclic shifts of this array will be sorted.
2. **k = 1:** The program returns the array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`. This is correct because only the first cyclic shift will be sorted.
3. **k ≠ 1 and k ≠ n:** The program returns `-1`. This is correct because, as shown in the test case `n = 3, k = 2`, no such array exists.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all specified cases and returns valid results based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
