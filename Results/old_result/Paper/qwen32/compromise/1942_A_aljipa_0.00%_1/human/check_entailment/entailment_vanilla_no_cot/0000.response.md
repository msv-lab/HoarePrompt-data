Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all possible cases for the given problem. Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Case `k == n`:** The program correctly outputs an array of `n` ones, which has all `n` cyclic shifts sorted. This is correct.

2. **Case `k == 1`:** The program outputs the array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, which indeed has exactly one sorted cyclic shift (the shift starting with `0`). This is correct.

3. **Case `1 < k < n`:** The program incorrectly outputs `-1` for all other cases. However, there can be valid arrays that meet the criteria for `1 < k < n`. For example, for `n = 3` and `k = 2`, a valid array could be `[1, 2, 1]`. The cyclic shifts are `[1, 2, 1]`, `[2, 1, 1]`, and `[1, 1, 2]`, where the first and third are sorted, satisfying `k = 2`.

To fix the program, you need to handle the case `1 < k < n` properly by constructing an array that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. One approach is to create an array that has a segment of sorted elements followed by a drop, ensuring that only `k` cyclic shifts are sorted.
