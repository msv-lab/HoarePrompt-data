You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000

Output

    18
    98

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x // 2
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x // 2
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, y is an integer which is the result of integer division of the corresponding x by 2, where x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always find the integer \( y \) (1 \le \( y \) < \( x \)) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. The program simply returns \( x // 2 \) for each test case, which does not guarantee the maximum value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

Let's consider a counterexample:

For \( x = 10 \):
- The program returns \( y = 10 // 2 = 5 \).
- \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\).

However, another possible \( y \) is 9:
- \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\).

In this case, both \( y = 5 \) and \( y = 9 \) give the same maximum value, but let's consider another example where the difference is more apparent:

For \( x = 21 \):
- The program returns \( y = 21 // 2 = 10 \).
- \(\gcd(21, 10) + 10 = 1 + 10 = 11\).

However, another possible \( y \) is 18:
- \(\gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 3 + 18 = 21\).

Here, \( y = 18 \) gives a higher value than \( y = 10 \). Therefore, the program does not always find the correct \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
