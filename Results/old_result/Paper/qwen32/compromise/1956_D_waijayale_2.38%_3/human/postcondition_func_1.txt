The function takes a list of integers `a` as input, where each integer is between 0 and 10^7, and the length of the list is between 1 and 18. It returns a tuple containing the sum of all integers in the list `a`, the length of the list `ops`, and the list `ops` itself. The purpose of the function is to compute the sum of the list and return it along with the length and contents of `ops`, which is modified by the recursive_maximize_sum function.
