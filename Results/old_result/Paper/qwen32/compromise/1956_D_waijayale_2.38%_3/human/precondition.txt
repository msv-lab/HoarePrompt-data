a is a list of integers of length n where 1 <= n <= 18, and each integer a_i in a satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 10^7. l and r are integers representing the start and end indices of a subarray, respectively, such that 1 <= l <= r <= n. ops is a list that will store the operations performed, where each operation is represented as a tuple (l, r).
