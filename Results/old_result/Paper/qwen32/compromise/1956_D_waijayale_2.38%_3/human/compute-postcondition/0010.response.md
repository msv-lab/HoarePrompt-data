The given code snippet calls a function `recursive_maximize_sum` with arguments `l` and `pos - 1`. This function call does not directly modify the variables `l`, `r`, `s`, `mx`, or `pos` in the provided initial state. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged after the function call.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a); `s` is the sum of `a[l:r + 1]` and is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1); `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`; `pos` is the index of `mx` in the original list `a`. The current value of `pos` is not equal to `l`.**
