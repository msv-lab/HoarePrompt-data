The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring into an integer, and then assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`.

Given the initial state, `a` was originally a list of integers, and `n` was an input integer. The code reassigns `a` to a new list of integers derived from the input. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `n` is an input integer.**
