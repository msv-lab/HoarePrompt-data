To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it interacts with the initial state. The loop iterates over pairs of values `(l, r)` from the `ops` list and prints `l + 1` and `r + 1`.

Given the loop:
```python
for l, r in ops:
    print(l + 1, r + 1)
```
The loop does not modify any variables outside its scope (`a`, `n`, `s`, `m`, and `ops`). It only prints values derived from the elements of `ops`.

Since the loop only prints values and does not modify the initial state variables, the output state will be the same as the initial state except for the printed output. The printed output will be a series of pairs of integers, each pair being `l + 1` and `r + 1` for each `(l, r)` in `ops`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `n` is an input integer, `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`. The loop prints pairs of integers `(l + 1, r + 1)` for each `(l, r)` in `ops`.**
