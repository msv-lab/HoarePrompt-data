Functionality: **The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from the input, processes the list using the function `func_2`, and prints two values `s` and `m` returned by `func_2`. It also prints pairs of integers derived from the operations list `ops` returned by `func_2`.**
