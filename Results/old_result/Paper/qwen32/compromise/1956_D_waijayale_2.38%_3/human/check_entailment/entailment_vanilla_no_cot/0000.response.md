Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect due to several issues:

1. **Undefined `a` in `recursive_maximize_sum`**: The function `recursive_maximize_sum` uses the variable `a` which is not defined within its scope. It should be passed as a parameter.

2. **Undefined `ops` in `recursive_maximize_sum`**: Similarly, `ops` is used in `recursive_maximize_sum` without being defined within its scope. It should be passed as a parameter.

3. **Incorrect logic in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is supposed to ensure that the subarray from `l` to `r` is filled with the MEX value, but the logic is flawed. It should compute the MEX value of the subarray and fill it with that value, not always fill with `r - l + 1`.

4. **Incorrect logic in `recursive_maximize_sum`**: The condition `s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` is not a correct way to determine whether to fill the subarray with the MEX value. The correct approach is to compute the MEX of the subarray and compare it with the current values.

5. **Incorrect handling of operations**: The operations are not correctly tracked and appended to the `ops` list.

6. **Incorrect function calls**: The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called within `func_2` but not defined as a nested function or imported.

To fix these issues, the logic for computing the MEX and filling the array should be corrected, and the operations should be properly tracked and appended to the `ops` list. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def mex_of_set(s):
    mex = 0
    while mex in s:
        mex += 1
    return mex

def func_1(a, l, r, ops):
    if l > r:
        return
    subarray = a[l:r+1]
    mex_value = mex_of_set(subarray)
    if mex_value != subarray[0]:
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = mex_value

def func_2(a):
    n = len(a)
    ops = []
    func_1(a, 0, n - 1, ops)
    return (sum(a), len(ops), ops)

def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (s, m, ops) = func_2(a)
    print(s, m)
    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)

# Example usage:
# func_3()
```

This corrected version properly computes the MEX of the subarray and fills it with the MEX value, while also correctly tracking and appending the operations to the `ops` list.
