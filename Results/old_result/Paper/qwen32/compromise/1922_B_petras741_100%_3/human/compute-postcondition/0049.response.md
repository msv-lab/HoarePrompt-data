Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and `w` is a list of integers derived from the input. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for all j from 0 to n-1, `eta` is a list containing all values of `j` for which `q[j] > 0`. If `eta_ln` (the length of `eta`) equals 1, `j` is `n` and `rho` is the count of the smallest integer in `w` that appears at least once. Otherwise, `j` is `eta_ln - 1`, `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `rho` is the count of the smallest integer in `w` that appears at least once plus the sum of `q[eta[j]]` for all `j` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`, and `res` is the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` for all `j` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for all `j` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`. If `n` is less than 3, no additional variables are defined and `n` remains unchanged.**
