Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `buffer` is an empty list.
- `n` is a new input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
- `w` is a list of `n` integers derived from the input.
- `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
- `j` is initialized to `n`.
- `eta` is a list containing all indices from 0 to `n` where `q[j] > 0`.
- `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, and it is given that `eta_ln` equals 1.
- `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
```

### Analysis:
The print statement calculates the number of combinations of `n` items taken 3 at a time, which is given by the formula:
\[
\binom{n}{3} = \frac{n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2)}{6}
\]

The value of `n` is an input integer, and the formula directly uses this value to compute the result. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `buffer`, `w`, `q`, `j`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`) are not used in the print statement, so their values do not affect the output of the print statement.

### Output:
The output of the print statement will be the integer value of the expression \(n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2) // 6\).

Output: **n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 (where n is the input integer)**
