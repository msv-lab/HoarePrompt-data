Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is the new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for all j from 0 to n-1, `eta` is a list containing all values of `j` for which `q[j] > 0`, `j` is `n`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and `eta_ln` equals 1, `rho` is the count of the smallest integer in `w` that appears at least once.**
