The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `w`. This means that the value of `w` changes based on the new input provided.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `w` is a list of `n` integers derived from the new input. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, and `res` are calculated as described in the initial state. If `n` is less than 3, no additional changes are made to `q`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, or `res`.**
