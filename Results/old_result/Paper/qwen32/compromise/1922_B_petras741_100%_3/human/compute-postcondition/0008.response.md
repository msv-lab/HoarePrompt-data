Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value at the index `w[j]` in the list `q` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
