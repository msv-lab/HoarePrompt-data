The code snippet provided only reads a new value for `n` from the input. This new value of `n` will replace the previous value of `n`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. 

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is the new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and `w` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
