The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `w`. The variables `t`, `i`, `buffer`, and `n` are not affected by this code snippet.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `i` is 0
- `buffer` is an empty list
- `n` is the new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n

After the code snippet is executed:
- `w` is a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is the new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
