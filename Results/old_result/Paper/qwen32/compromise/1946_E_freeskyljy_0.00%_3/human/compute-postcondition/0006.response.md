Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2` are integers such that 1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` are integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order, where 1 <= p_i <= n. `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` are integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order, where 1 <= s_i <= n. The sum of the values of `n` for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values from the input. `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input. `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input. Additionally, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The condition (L[0] != 1 or R[0] != N) is true, meaning either the first element of `L` is not 1 or the first element of `R` is not `N`.**
