The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `j`. None of the other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `p` is `l[0]`; `q` is `l[p - 1]`; `q` equals `i + 1`.**
