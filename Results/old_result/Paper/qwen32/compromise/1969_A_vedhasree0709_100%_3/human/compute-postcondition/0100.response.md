The provided `print` statement is `print(3)`. This statement will output the integer `3` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, or `j` mentioned in the initial state. The initial state does not affect the execution of this specific `print` statement because it is printing a constant value.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **3**
