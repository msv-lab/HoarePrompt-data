The `print(2)` statement in the given Python code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `p`, or `q` defined in the initial state. The statement simply prints the integer `2`.

Let's break down the information provided:
- `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 3.
- `l` is a list of integers derived from the input.
- `i` is set to 2.
- `p` is the element at index 2 in the list `l`.
- `q` is the element at index `p - 1` in the list `l`.

None of these variables affect the value printed by `print(2)`, which is a constant integer.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **2**
