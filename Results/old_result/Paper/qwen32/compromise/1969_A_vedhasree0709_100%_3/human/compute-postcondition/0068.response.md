The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` in the `range(int(input()))` statement. This loop iterates a number of times specified by the integer input. Since the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop body, we do not need to adjust it directly. However, the number of iterations is determined by the input integer, which is not explicitly mentioned as a state variable. 

Given that the loop iterates based on the input integer, we need to ensure that the input integer is decremented to allow for another iteration.

However, since we are only allowed to adjust the states of objects in the loop head and the loop head does not contain any state variables that we can directly adjust, we can infer that the state should reflect the decrement in the number of iterations left.

Since the loop head does not provide any direct way to decrement the input integer, we can assume that the state should reflect the next iteration's condition. 

Given the provided state and the loop structure, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that the loop is about to execute again, meaning the number of iterations left should be one less than the current number of iterations.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input; `i` is `n`; `j` is 0 if `q` equals `i + 1` has not occurred at any iteration**

Since the loop head does not provide any direct variables to adjust, the state remains the same except for the implicit understanding that the number of iterations left is one less. 

However, if we strictly adhere to the requirement of adjusting only the state of objects in the loop head, and since there are no such objects to adjust, the state remains unchanged for the loop head variables.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input; `i` is `n`; `j` is 0 if `q` equals `i + 1` has not occurred at any iteration**
