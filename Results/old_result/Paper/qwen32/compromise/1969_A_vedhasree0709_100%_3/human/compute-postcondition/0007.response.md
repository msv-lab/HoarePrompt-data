Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 0; `p` is the first element of `l`; `q` is the element at index `p - 1` in the list `l`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is: `t` and `n` remain unchanged, `l` remains the same list of integers, `i` and `j` are still 0, `p` is still the first element of `l`, and `q` is the element at index `p - 1` in the list `l`.
