The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was initially 1, it is now 2. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `j`, `p`, `q`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 2; `j` is 1 if `q` equals `i + 1`, otherwise `j` remains 0; `p` is `l[1]`; `q` is `l[l[1] - 1]`.**
