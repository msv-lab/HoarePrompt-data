Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` must be at least 2; `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 1; `p` is `l[1]`; `q` is `l[p - 1]`; `j` is 1; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `p`, `q`, and `j` remain the same as they were in the initial state, except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
