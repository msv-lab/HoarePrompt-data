The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `p` is `l[0]`; `q` is `l[p - 1]`; `q` equals `i + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `p` is `l[0]`; `q` is `l[p - 1]`; `q` equals `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
