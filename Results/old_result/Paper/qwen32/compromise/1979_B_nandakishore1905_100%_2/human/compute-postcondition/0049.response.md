The value of `q` is updated to `2 ** (p - 1)`. Given that `p` is 2, the expression `2 ** (p - 1)` evaluates to `2 ** (2 - 1)`, which is `2 ** 1` and equals 2. Therefore, `q` remains 2. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9, `n` and `m` are integers such that `abs(n - m) = 5`, `k` is 5, `l` is '11', `p` is 2, `f` is 3, `q` is 2.**
