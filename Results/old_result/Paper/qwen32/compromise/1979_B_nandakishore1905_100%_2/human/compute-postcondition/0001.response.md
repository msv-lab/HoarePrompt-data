The provided code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into two integers, which are then assigned to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a specific range and that for each test case, `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers within another specific range. However, these variables `x` and `y` are not mentioned in the provided code snippet, so they remain unchanged. The variable `t` is also not directly affected by the code snippet, as it is used to determine the number of test cases and not altered within the snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input.**
