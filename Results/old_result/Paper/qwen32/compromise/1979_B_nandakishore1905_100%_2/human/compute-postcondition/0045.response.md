Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9, `n` and `m` are integers such that `abs(n - m) = 5`, `k` is 5, `l` is '11', `p` is 2, `f` is 1, `q` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `f` has been updated to 1 after the operation `f = f - q`, where `f` was initially 3 and `q` is 2. All other variables retain their initial values.
