The code snippet `l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')` converts the integer `f` to its binary representation, removes the '0b' prefix, and assigns the result back to `l`. Given that `f` is 3, its binary representation is '11'. Therefore, `l` will be updated to '11'.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9, `n` and `m` are integers such that `abs(n - m) = 5`, `k` is `abs(n - m) = 5`, `l` is '11', `p` is the length of the binary string `l`, `f` is `k - 2 = 3`**
