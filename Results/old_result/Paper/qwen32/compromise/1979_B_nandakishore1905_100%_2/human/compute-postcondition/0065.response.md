The code snippet converts the integer `k` to its binary representation as a string, removes the '0b' prefix, and assigns this binary string to the variable `l`. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, but since its previous value is not specified, we only note that it has been incremented.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9, `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, `k` is `abs(n - m)`, `i` is incremented by 1, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix.**
