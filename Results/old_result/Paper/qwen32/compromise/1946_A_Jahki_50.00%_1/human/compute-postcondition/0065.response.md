The given code snippet assigns the value of `b[ma]` to `new_median`. Based on the initial state, `new_median` was previously set to `b[ma] + 1`. After executing the code, `new_median` will now hold the value of `b[ma]`.

Given that `ma` is calculated as `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`, and `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1 and correctly positioned, the new value of `new_median` will be the value at the middle index `ma` of the list `b`.

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers parsed from `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string, `op` is 3, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1 and correctly positioned, `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, `new_median` is `b[ma]`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`**.

In simple terms, `new_median` is now equal to the value at index `ma` in the list `b`. All other variables retain their previous values.
