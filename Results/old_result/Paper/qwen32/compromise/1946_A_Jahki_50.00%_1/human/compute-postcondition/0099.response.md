To determine what will be printed by the `print(op)` statement, let's analyze the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `a` is a list of integers parsed from the input string `case`.
- `num` is greater than 0.
- `num2` is an input integer.
- `case` is the new input string.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `op` is 4.
- `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 4.
- `median` is `b[ma] - 1`.
- `new_median` is `b[ma]`.
- `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`.

From this information, we see that the value of `op` is explicitly stated to be 4. None of the other variables affect the value of `op`.

Thus, when the `print(op)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `op`, which is 4.

Output: **4**
