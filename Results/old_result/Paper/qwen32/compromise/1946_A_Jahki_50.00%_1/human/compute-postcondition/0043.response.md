Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string, `op` is 0, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented until `new_median` is greater than `median`, `median` is `median_initial`, and `new_median` is `median_initial + 1`, `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables remain unchanged except for the fact that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
