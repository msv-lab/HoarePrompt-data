The `print(1)` statement in the provided code snippet will simply print the integer `1`.

Let's break down the context provided:

- `t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `num2`, `case`, `op`, `b`, `median`, `new_median`, and `i` are all described with certain properties or initial states, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print(1)` statement directly outputs the integer `1` without referencing any of the other variables or their values.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of the other variables.

Output: **1**
