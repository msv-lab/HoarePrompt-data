The given code snippet assigns the value of `b[ma]` to `new_median`. Since `ma` is already calculated based on whether `num2` is even or odd, and `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 2, the value of `new_median` will be the value at index `ma` in the list `b`.

Given that `new_median` was previously defined as `b[ma]`, the assignment `new_median = b[ma]` does not change its value. Therefore, the state remains the same with respect to `new_median`.

Here is the Output State:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers parsed from the input string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 1`, `op` is 2, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 2, `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, `new_median` is `b[ma]`, and `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`**.
