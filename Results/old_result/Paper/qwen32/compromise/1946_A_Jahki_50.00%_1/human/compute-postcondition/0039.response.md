The code snippet `case = input()` reads an input string and assigns it to the variable `case`. This affects only the variable `case` and does not change the values of any other variables.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `case` now holds the value of the input string. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string, `op` is either 0 or the number of times the loop ran. If `num2` is greater than 10000, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, `op` is the number of times the loop ran, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented until `new_median` is greater than `median`, `median` is `median_initial`, and `new_median` is `median_initial + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**
