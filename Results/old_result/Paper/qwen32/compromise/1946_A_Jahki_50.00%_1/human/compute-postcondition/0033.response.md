The code snippet `new_median = b[ma]` assigns the value of `b[ma]` to `new_median`. This means that `new_median` will now hold the same value as `b[ma]`.

Given the initial state, `new_median` was previously defined as `b[ma] + 2`. After executing the code, `new_median` is reassigned to just `b[ma]`, effectively removing the addition of 2.

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is 3, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 3, `median` is `median`, `new_median` is `b[ma]`**.
