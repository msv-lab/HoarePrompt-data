The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the number of operations needed to increase the median of the list `a` by at least one. If `n` is greater than 10000, it outputs 1 followed by 16668. Otherwise, it outputs the number of operations required to achieve the desired condition.
