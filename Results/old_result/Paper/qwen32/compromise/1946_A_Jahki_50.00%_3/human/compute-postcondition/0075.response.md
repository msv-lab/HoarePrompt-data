The `break` statement will terminate the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in, but it does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `num2`, `case`, `op`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
