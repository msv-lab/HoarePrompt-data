The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `num2`. This means that `num2` will take on the integer value provided by the user input. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `num` must be greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer.**
