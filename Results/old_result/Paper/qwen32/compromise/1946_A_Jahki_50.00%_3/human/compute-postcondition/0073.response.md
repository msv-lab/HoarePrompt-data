Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's analyze what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `num` is greater than 0.
- `num2` is an input integer.
- `case` is an input string.
- `op` is 0.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the integer `1`. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `num2`, `case`, `op`, `i`) are used in this particular `print` statement. Therefore, the output will be the literal value `1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1**
