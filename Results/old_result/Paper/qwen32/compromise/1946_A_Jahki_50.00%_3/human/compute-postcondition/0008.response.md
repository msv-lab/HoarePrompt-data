Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an integer greater than 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables remain unchanged, and we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
