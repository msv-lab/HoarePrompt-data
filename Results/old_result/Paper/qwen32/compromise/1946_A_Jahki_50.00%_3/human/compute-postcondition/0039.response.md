The code snippet provided only updates the value of the variable `case` by reading an input string. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`.**
