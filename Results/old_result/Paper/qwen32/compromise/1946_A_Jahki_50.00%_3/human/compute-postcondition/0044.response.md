The given code snippet updates the list `a` by splitting the input string `case` into individual elements, converting those elements to integers if they are digits, and assigning them back to `a`. The other variables remain unchanged unless explicitly modified.

Given the initial state, `a` was originally a list of `n` integers. After executing the code, `a` will be reassigned to a new list formed from the integers in the input string `case`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`.**
