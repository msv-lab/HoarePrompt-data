To determine how to modify the program state so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head:

```python
while new_median <= median:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`
- `num` is greater than 0
- `num2` is an input integer that is less than or equal to 10000
- `case` is an input string
- `op` is 1
- `b` is the sorted list of integers derived from `a` with the element at index `ma` incremented by 1
- `ma` is calculated as `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, or `(num2 - 1) // 2` if `num2` is odd
- `median` is the element at index `ma` in the original sorted list `b`
- `new_median` is equal to `median`

Since `new_median` is equal to `median` at the end of the previous iteration, the condition `new_median <= median` is true, and the loop will execute again unless we change this condition.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to keep `new_median` less than or equal to `median`. Since `new_median` is currently equal to `median`, we can slightly adjust `new_median` to be less than `median` to guarantee the loop condition remains true.

However, since `new_median` is derived from `b` and `median` is the element at index `ma` in the original sorted list `b`, and `new_median` is specifically defined as `median`, we need to consider how `new_median` could be adjusted within the context of the problem. Given that `new_median` is directly set to `median`, the only way to ensure the loop continues is to ensure that `new_median` remains less than or equal to `median` after any potential modifications.

Since the problem specifies that `new_median` is equal to `median`, and no other adjustments are made to `new_median` or `median` in the provided state, the simplest adjustment to ensure the loop condition remains true is to leave `new_median` as it is and ensure `median` is appropriately defined such that `new_median <= median` holds true.

Therefore, the state remains the same as the end of the previous iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer that is less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is 1, `b` is the sorted list of integers derived from `a` with the element at index `ma` incremented by 1, `ma` is calculated as `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, or `(num2 - 1) // 2` if `num2` is odd, `median` is the element at index `ma` in the original sorted list `b`, `new_median` is equal to `median`**
