The given code snippet modifies the list `a` by splitting the input string `case` into individual components, checking if each component is a digit, converting those components to integers, and then assigning them back to `a`. 

Since `case` is an input string, its exact value is not specified, but we know it will be split and filtered to form a new list `a` consisting of integers.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `num`, `num2`, `op`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer that is less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0.**
