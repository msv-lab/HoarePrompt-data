The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer such that n >= 3 (and 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5), `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 <= a_i <= n, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[0]]` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `j` is 1**
