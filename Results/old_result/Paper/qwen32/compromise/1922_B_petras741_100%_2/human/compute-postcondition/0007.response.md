The only variable in the loop head is `j` and the range it iterates over is `n`. To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `n` is at least 1. However, according to the problem statement, `n` is already given such that `n >= 3`, so no adjustment is needed for `n`. The variable `j` will be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `j` is 0, and `n` is at least 3 (which is already given).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer such that n >= 3 (and 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5), `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 <= a_i <= n, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `j` is 0**
