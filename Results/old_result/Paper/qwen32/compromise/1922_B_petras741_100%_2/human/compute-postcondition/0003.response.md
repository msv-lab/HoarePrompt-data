The code snippet `n = int(input())` will read an integer from the input and assign it to the variable `n`. This means the value of `n` will be updated to whatever integer is provided by the input, but the constraints on `n` (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) will still apply. The other variables `t`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and `buffer` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 <= a_i <= n, `buffer` is an empty list**.
