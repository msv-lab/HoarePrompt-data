Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 <= a_i <= n, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers, `i` is `k + 2`, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `eta` contains all values `j` from `0` to `n` for which `q[j] > 0` (which is an empty list since all elements of `q` are 0), `eta_ln` is the count of values in `eta` (which is 0), `rho` is `q[eta[0]]` if `eta_ln` equals 1 (which does not apply), `rho` is the sum of `q[eta[j]]` for all `j` from `0` to `eta_ln - 1` and `res` is the computed sum of terms involving each `q[eta[j]]` and the cumulative `rho` (which are all 0 since `eta` is empty). If `n` < 3, other variables remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    q[w[j]] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be at least 1, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 <= a_i <= n, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers, `i` is `k + 2`, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `q[w[j]]` which is 1, `eta` contains the value `w[j]`, `eta_ln` is 1, `rho` is 1, `res` is updated to include the term for `q[w[j]]` and the cumulative `rho`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be at least 1, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 <= a_i <= n, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers, `i` is `k + 2`, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `q[w[j]]` which is 2, `eta` contains the value `w[j]`, `eta_ln` is 1, `rho` is 1, `res` is updated to include the term for `q[w[j]]` and the cumulative `rho`, `j` is `k + 3`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be at least 1, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 <= a_i <= n, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers, `i` is `k + 2`, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `q[w[j]]` which is 3, `eta` contains the value `w[j]`, `eta_ln` is 1, `rho` is 1, `res` is updated to include the term for `q[w[j]]` and the cumulative `rho`, `j` is `k + 4`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
