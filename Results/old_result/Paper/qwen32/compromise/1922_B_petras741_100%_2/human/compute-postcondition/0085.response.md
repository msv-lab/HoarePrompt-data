The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `eta_ln`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `eta_ln`. If `j` is less than `eta_ln`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the last value it took, and `eta_ln` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 and `eta_ln` must still be greater than the new value of `j`.

From the previous iteration:
- `j` was the last value it took, and since the loop is about to start the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1.
- `eta_ln` must be greater than the new value of `j` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, if `j` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it should be 2 at the start of the next iteration. `eta_ln` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`eta` contains all values `j` from `0` to `n` for which `q[j] > 0`; `eta_ln` must be greater than 2; `rho` is `rho + q[eta[j]]`; `res` is `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`; `j` is 2**
