Postcondition: **`eta` contains all values `j` from `0` to `n` for which `q[j] > 0`; `eta_ln` is the count of values in `eta`. If `eta_ln` equals 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`. Otherwise, `rho` is the sum of `q[eta[j]]` for all `j` from `0` to `eta_ln - 1` and `res` is the computed sum of terms involving each `q[eta[j]]` and the cumulative `rho`.**
