Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 <= a_i <= n, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers. If `n` >= 3, then `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is `n + 1` if `eta_ln` is 1, otherwise `j` is `eta_ln - 1`, `eta` is a list containing all the indices from 0 to n for which `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]` if `eta_ln` is 1, otherwise `rho` is the sum of all `q[eta[j]]` for `j` from `0` to `eta_ln - 1`. If `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `res` is the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` and `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for `j` from `1` to `eta_ln - 1`. If `n` < 3, then no further changes are made to the variables beyond the initial conditions.**
