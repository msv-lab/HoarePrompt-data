The code snippet `*_, k = R()` unpacks the input read by the lambda function `R()` such that all elements except the last one are ignored (assigned to `_`), and the last element is assigned to `k`.

Given the initial state, `t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` < `r` ≤ `n`; `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer.

The only variable that changes due to the execution of this code is `k`, which is assigned the last value from the input read by `R()`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` < `r` ≤ `n`; `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer; `k` is the last value read from the input by `R()`.**
