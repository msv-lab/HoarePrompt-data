To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to understand how the loop affects the variables. The loop iterates `m` times, and during each iteration, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `f` from the input, and adds `f` to `sum_f`.

Given the initial state and the outputs after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that after `m` iterations, `sum_f` will be the sum of all `f` values read during these iterations. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, `gcd`, `i`, and `t`) do not change within the loop.

Here's the detailed breakdown:

- `n`: Remains unchanged.
- `m`: Remains unchanged.
- `k`: Remains unchanged.
- `sum_f`: After `m` iterations, `sum_f` will be the sum of all `f` values read during these iterations.
- `j`: The loop variable `j` is used in the loop header but does not affect the final output state outside the loop. It simply iterates from 0 to `m-1`.
- `cn2`: Calculated once as `n * (n - 1) // 2` and remains unchanged.
- `p` and `q`: These are recalculated based on the final value of `sum_f` after the loop completes.
- `gcd`: Recalculated based on the final values of `p` and `q`.
- `i`: Set to `m + 1` and remains unchanged.
- `t`: Must be greater than `m + 1` and remains unchanged.

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read during the `m` iterations, `j` is equal to `m`, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is calculated as `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, `i` is `m + 1`, `t` must be greater than `m + 1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `sum_f` will hold the total sum of all `f` values provided in the input, and the other variables will retain their initial values or be recalculated based on the final `sum_f`.
