The only variable in the loop head is `j`, and `m` determines how many times the loop will execute. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` has taken on a specific value, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `m`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is an integer (no change needed)
- `b` is an integer (no change needed)
- `f` is an integer (no change needed)
- `sum_f` is an integer equal to its previous value plus `f` (no change needed)

The only adjustment needed is for `j` to be incremented by 1.

State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `sum_f` is an integer equal to its previous value plus `f`, `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `m`**
