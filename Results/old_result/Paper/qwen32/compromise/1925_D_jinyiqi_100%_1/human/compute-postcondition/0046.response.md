The given code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. None of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, `j`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, `gcd`, `i`, `t`) are modified by this code.

Therefore, the Output State includes the new values for `a`, `b`, and `f`, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, `i` is `m + 1`, `t` is unchanged, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the three integers read from the input.**
