The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. This means the values of `a`, `b`, and `f` will be updated based on the new input, while the values of `sum_f`, `j`, and `m` remain unchanged unless they are explicitly modified elsewhere in the code.

Given the initial state, the variables `sum_f` and `j` have specific relationships and constraints (`sum_f` is an integer equal to its previous value plus `f` twice, and `j` is `previous_j + 1`, with `j` being less than `m`). However, these relationships and constraints are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input, `f` is an integer from input, `sum_f` is an integer equal to its previous value plus `f` twice, `j` is `previous_j + 1`, `j` must be less than `m`**.
