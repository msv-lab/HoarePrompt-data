The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state only mentions that `t` is an input integer within a specific range. Since `n`, `m`, and `k` are newly introduced and assigned values from the input, they do not affect the initial state of `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input.**
