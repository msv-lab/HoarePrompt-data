The code modifies the value of `q` by dividing it by `gcd`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sum_f` is the cumulative sum of all f values read over m iterations, `j` is equal to m, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is calculated as `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
