To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the state. The loop iterates `m` times, and during each iteration, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `f` from the input, and updates `sum_f` by adding `f` to it. The variable `j` is used as the loop counter but does not affect the final state of `sum_f`.

Here's the breakdown of the loop's effect:
- The loop runs `m` times.
- In each iteration, `sum_f` is incremented by the value of `f` read from the input.
- Variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, `gcd`, `i`, and `t` do not change within the loop.

Given that the loop runs `m` times, after all iterations, `sum_f` will be the sum of all `f` values read from the input over `m` iterations.

Let's denote the `f` values read in each iteration as `f1, f2, ..., fm`. Then, after `m` iterations, `sum_f` will be `f1 + f2 + ... + fm`.

Since the problem statement does not provide specific values for `f` in each iteration, we can only express the final state in terms of these `f` values.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over `m` iterations, `j` is 0, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, `i` is `m + 1`, `t` is unchanged.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `sum_f` will be the total sum of the `f` values read in each of the `m` iterations, and all other variables will remain as initially defined or calculated based on the new `sum_f`.
