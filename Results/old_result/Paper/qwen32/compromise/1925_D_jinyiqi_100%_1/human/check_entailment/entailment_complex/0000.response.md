### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to understand whether it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Inputs:**
   - Number of test cases `t`
   - For each test case:
     - Number of children `n`
     - Number of friend pairs `m`
     - Number of excursions `k`
     - List of `m` friend pairs with their initial friendship values

2. **Objective:**
   - Compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - Express the result as a fraction `p/q` where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.
   - Output `p * q^-1 mod (10^9 + 7)`.

#### Key Points:
- The probability of choosing any specific pair during an excursion is `1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`.
- The friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time it is chosen.
- The expected value calculation involves considering the contributions from both existing friendships and the potential new friendships formed during the excursions.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the `m` friend pairs and their initial friendship values.

2. **Calculating Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - `sum_f` accumulates the sum of all initial friendship values.

3. **Combinatorial Calculations:**
   - `cn2` is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n`, which is `n * (n - 1) / 2`.
   - `p` and `q` are calculated based on the formula derived from the problem statement:
     - `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`
     - `q = 2 * cn2 ** 2`

4. **Simplifying the Fraction:**
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of `p` and `q` is computed.
   - `p` and `q` are divided by their GCD to simplify the fraction.

5. **Modular Inverse Calculation:**
   - The modular inverse of `q` modulo `M` is computed using `pow(q, -1, M)`.
   - The final result is `(p * q^-1) % M`.

6. **Output:**
   - The result for each test case is printed.

#### Verification Against Examples:
- The code correctly handles the first test case where there are no friend pairs, resulting in an output of `0`.
- The second test case involves a single pair with an initial friendship value of `1`. The expected sum of friendship values over `10` excursions is indeed `55`.
- The third and fourth test cases involve multiple pairs and require careful computation of the expected values, which the code seems to handle correctly based on the provided outputs.

### Conclusion:
The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles multiple test cases efficiently and computes the expected value of the sum of friendship values correctly.

**Correctness: True**
