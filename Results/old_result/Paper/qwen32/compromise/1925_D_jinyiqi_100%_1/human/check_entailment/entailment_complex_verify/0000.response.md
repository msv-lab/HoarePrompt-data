### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze the logic and ensure that the formulas used for calculating `p` and `q` align with the problem requirements. Let's break down the steps and verify the logic:

1. **Reading Input and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It initializes `sum_f` to accumulate the sum of initial friendship values.

2. **Calculating `sum_f`**:
   - The program iterates through the `m` pairs of friends and adds their friendship values to `sum_f`.

3. **Computing `cn2`**:
   - `cn2` is calculated as \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \), which represents the total number of ways to choose 2 children from `n` children.

4. **Formulas for `p` and `q`**:
   - The formula for `p` is given as \( 2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) \).
   - The formula for `q` is given as \( 2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2 \).

Let's verify these formulas:

- **Expected Value Calculation**:
  - The expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for excursions involves considering both the initial friendship values and the expected increase in friendship values due to repeated selections.
  - For each pair of friends, the expected increase in friendship value after `k` excursions can be derived using the probability of selecting that pair.
  - The term \( 2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} \) accounts for the contribution of the initial friendship values.
  - The term \( m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) \) accounts for the expected increase in friendship values due to repeated selections of friend pairs.

- **Normalization**:
  - The denominator \( 2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2 \) normalizes the expected value calculation by considering the total number of possible pairs and the number of ways to choose them.

5. **Reducing the Fraction**:
   - The program reduces the fraction by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (`gcd`).

6. **Modular Inverse and Output**:
   - The program computes the modular inverse of `q` modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) using `pow(q, -1, M)` and prints the result.

### Verification Against Examples:

1. **No Friend Pairs (`m = 0`)**:
   - Input: `100 0 24`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Program Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Single Pair of Friends (`m = 1`)**:
   - Input: `2 1 10` followed by `1 2 1`
   - Expected Output: `55` (Sum of first 10 natural numbers)
   - Program Output: `55` (Correct)

3. **Multiple Friend Pairs (`m > 1`)**:
   - Input: `5 2 4` followed by `1 2 25` and `3 2 24`
   - Expected Output: `40000020`
   - Program Output: `40000020` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis and verification against the provided examples and edge cases, the program appears to correctly implement the solution as per the problem description. The formulas used for `p` and `q` seem to be derived correctly, and the program handles various edge cases appropriately.

**Final: True**

The given program is correct.
