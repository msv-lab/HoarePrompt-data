The code appends a tuple `(node, x)` to the `stack`. Given the initial state, `node` is 4 and `x` is 1. Therefore, the tuple `(4, 1)` will be appended to the `stack`. 

The `stack` initially is `[(1, 1), (node, 1), (3, 1)]`, and since `node` is 4, it is `[(1, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1)]`. After appending `(4, 1)`, the `stack` becomes `[(1, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)]`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree where `g[1]` must contain at least one more node, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < number of vertices in `g`, `stack` is `[(1, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)]`, `visited` is `{1}`, `d` is `{1: 1}`, `r` is 0, `x` is 1, `p` is 1, and `node` is 4.**
