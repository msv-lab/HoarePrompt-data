Postcondition: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < number of vertices in `g`, `stack` is `[(1, 1)]`, `visited` is an empty set, `r` is `0`, `x` is `1`, `p` is `1`, and `x` is in `visited`. If `d[x]` (which is `d[1]`) is greater than or equal to `A`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `d[x]` is updated to `2`.**
