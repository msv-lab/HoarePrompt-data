Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < number of vertices in g, `stack` is `[(1, 1)]`, `visited` is an empty set.**

Explanation: The variable `visited` is initialized as an empty set, and all other variables retain their initial values.
