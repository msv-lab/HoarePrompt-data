Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a tree, an integer `k` representing the number of edges to be removed, and a list of tuples `edges` where each tuple represents an edge connecting two vertices. It calculates and prints the largest value `r` such that the tree can be divided into `r` connected components by removing at most `k` edges.**
