The code snippet `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Given the initial state, `adj[a]` already includes `b` appended to its previous contents. After executing the code, `adj[a]` will have `b` appended one more time.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2; `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input; `adj[a]` includes `b` appended twice to its previous contents; `adj[b]` includes `a` appended twice to its previous contents; `i` is `i + 1`.**
