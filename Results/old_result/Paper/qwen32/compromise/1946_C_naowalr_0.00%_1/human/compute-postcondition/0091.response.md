The code snippet creates a list of empty lists, with the length of the outer list being `n + 1`. This means `adj` is now a list containing `n + 1` empty lists. The values of `L`, `R`, `adj`, `numCuts`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `z` are relevant to the output state. Specifically, `adj` has been updated, and `z` has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`L` and `R` are two consecutive integers, the loop will terminate, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `numCuts` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `n` and `k` are assigned new integer values from input, `z` is incremented by 1.**
