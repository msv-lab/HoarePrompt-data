The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value. Since `n` must be at least 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n - 1`.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_end`. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 1`.

Given that `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, if `i` was `x` at the start of the previous iteration, it would be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration. Since we don't have the exact value of `i` at the start of the previous iteration, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` must be at least 2; `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input; `adj[a]` includes `b` appended to its previous contents; `adj[b]` includes `a` appended twice to its previous contents; `i` is `i + 1`.**
