The code appends the integer `b` to the list at index `a` in the list `adj`. This means that the list at index `a` in `adj` now contains `b` as its element.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` contains `b`; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is an integer such that 0 < k < n; `a` is the first integer read from the input; `b` is the second integer read from the input.**
