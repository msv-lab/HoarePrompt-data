Output State: **`n` must be at least 2; `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input; `adj[a]` includes `b` appended to its previous contents; `adj[b]` includes `a` appended twice to its previous contents; `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code appends `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Since `adj[b]` already included `a` from the initial state, after executing the code, `adj[b]` will now include `a` twice. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
