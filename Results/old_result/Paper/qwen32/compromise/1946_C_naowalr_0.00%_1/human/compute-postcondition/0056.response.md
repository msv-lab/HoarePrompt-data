The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition `i < n - 1` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.

State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` contains `b` and possibly other elements, `adj[b]` contains `a` and possibly other elements, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the second integer read from input, `L` is 1, `R` is 2, `numCuts` is 0, `z` is 1, `t` is some integer greater than 1, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from input, `i` is 2**
