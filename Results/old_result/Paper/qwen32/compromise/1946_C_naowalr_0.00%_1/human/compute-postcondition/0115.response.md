Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `x` contains all integers connected to `x` from the input pairs; `L` is 1; `R` is 50001; `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k`; `z` remains unchanged; `x` is 50001; `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`; either `numCuts` is less than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`).**

In this output state, the value of `R` has been updated to 50001. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
