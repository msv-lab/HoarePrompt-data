To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `adj` list. The loop runs `n - 1` times, and in each iteration, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input and appends `b` to `adj[a]` and `a` to `adj[b]`. This effectively builds an adjacency list representation of an undirected graph with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges.

Given that the loop runs `n - 1` times, after all iterations, the `adj` list will contain the adjacency information for all the edges provided as input. Each pair `(a, b)` will result in `b` being added to the list at index `a` and `a` being added to the list at index `b`.

Let's summarize the final output state:

- `adj` will be a list of `n + 1` lists.
- For each edge `(a, b)` provided as input, `adj[a]` will contain `b`, and `adj[b]` will contain `a`.
- `n` remains the same as initially provided.
- `k` remains the same as initially provided (though it is not used within the loop).

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` for each iteration are not specified beyond the first three, we can't list the specific contents of `adj` without that information. However, we know the structure and content pattern based on the loop behavior.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the vertices `b` that are directly connected to `a` by an edge; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is an integer such that 0 < k < n.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is that `adj` fully represents the adjacency list of an undirected graph with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges, where each node points to its directly connected neighbors.
