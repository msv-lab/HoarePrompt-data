The provided code snippet reads two integers from the standard input, which are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k`. This means the values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the input, while the other variables (`adj`, `t`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, and `k` must be greater than 0 and less than `n`; `t` must be greater than 0.**
