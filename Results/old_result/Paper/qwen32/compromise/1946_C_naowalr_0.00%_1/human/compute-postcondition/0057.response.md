The code snippet reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This means the previous values of `a` and `b` are overwritten by the new values read from the input.

Given the initial state, the only variables that change are `a` and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` contains `b` and possibly other elements, `adj[b]` contains `a` and possibly other elements, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the second integer read from input, `L` is 1, `R` is 2, `numCuts` is 0, `z` is 1, `t` is some integer greater than 1, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from input, `i` is 2.**

In natural language: The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the two integers read from the input. All other variables retain their initial values.
