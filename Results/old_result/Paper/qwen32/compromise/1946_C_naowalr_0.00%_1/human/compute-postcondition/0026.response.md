Postcondition: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the vertices `b` that are directly connected to `a` by an edge; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is an integer such that 0 < k < n; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001; `numCuts` is 1; `x` is 50001; `leftover` is 42; `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`.**
