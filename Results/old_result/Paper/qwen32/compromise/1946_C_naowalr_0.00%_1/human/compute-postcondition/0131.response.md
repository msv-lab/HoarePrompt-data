To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the binary search algorithm implemented in the loop. The loop continues until `R - L > 1` is no longer true, meaning it will stop when `R` and `L` are consecutive integers.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `L` is 1
   - `R` is 100001

2. **After 1st Iteration**:
   - `x` is calculated as `(1 + 100001) // 2 = 50001`
   - Depending on the value of `numCuts` and `leftover`, either `L` becomes 50001 or `R` becomes 50001.

3. **After 2nd Iteration**:
   - If `L` became 50001, `x` is `(50001 + 100001) // 2 = 75001`
   - If `R` became 50001, `x` is `(1 + 50001) // 2 = 25001`
   - Again, depending on `numCuts` and `leftover`, either `L` or `R` is updated.

4. **After 3rd Iteration**:
   - Depending on the previous updates, `x` is recalculated.
   - For example, if `L` was 50001 and `R` was 100001, `x` would be `(50001 + 100001) // 2 = 75001`
   - If `L` was 1 and `R` was 50001, `x` would be `(1 + 50001) // 2 = 25001`
   - If `L` was 25001 and `R` was 50001, `x` would be `(25001 + 50001) // 2 = 37501`
   - If `L` was 50001 and `R` was 75001, `x` would be `(50001 + 75001) // 2 = 62501`
   - If `L` was 1 and `R` was 25001, `x` would be `(1 + 25001) // 2 = 12501`
   - If `L` was 25001 and `R` was 37501, `x` would be `(25001 + 37501) // 2 = 31251`
   - If `L` was 37501 and `R` was 50001, `x` would be `(37501 + 50001) // 2 = 43751`
   - If `L` was 50001 and `R` was 62501, `x` would be `(50001 + 62501) // 2 = 56251`
   - If `L` was 62501 and `R` was 75001, `x` would be `(62501 + 75001) // 2 = 68751`
   - If `L` was 75001 and `R` was 100001, `x` would be `(75001 + 100001) // 2 = 87501`

5. **Continuing the Process**:
   - This process continues, narrowing down the range between `L` and `R` until they become consecutive integers.

6. **Final State**:
   - The loop terminates when `R - L <= 1`, which means `L` and `R` will be two consecutive integers.
   - The final value of `x` will be the last midpoint calculated before the loop terminates.
   - `numCuts` and `leftover` will be determined by the last iteration of the loop.

Based on the provided information and the nature of binary search, the final output state will be when `L` and `R` are consecutive integers. Let's assume the final values of `L` and `R` are `a` and `a+1` respectively, where `a` is the largest integer such that the conditions `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`) are not met.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists; `z` remains unchanged; `L` is `a`; `R` is `a + 1`; `x` is the last calculated midpoint; `numCuts` and `leftover` are determined by the last iteration.**

In simpler terms, the loop will terminate when `L` and `R` are consecutive integers, and the final values of `L` and `R` will be the result of the binary search process.
