The code snippet sets `numCuts` to 0. This means the value of `numCuts` changes from its previous value (which is unspecified but remains unchanged according to the initial state) to 0. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `x` contains all integers connected to `x` from the input pairs; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001; `numCuts` is 0; `z` remains unchanged.**
