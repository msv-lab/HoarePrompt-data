The code reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state of `adj`, `n`, and `k` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is an integer such that 0 < k < n, `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input.**
