Given the initial state, we know that `L` and `R` are two consecutive integers, but their exact values are not specified directly. The loop terminates after determining these values, and the `print(L)` statement will output the value of `L`.

Since `L` and `R` are consecutive integers, and no specific values are provided for them, we can only describe `L` as one of the two consecutive integers determined by the loop's logic. 

Thus, the output of the `print(L)` statement will be the value of `L`, which is one of the two consecutive integers resulting from the loop's execution.

Output: **L (where L is one of the two consecutive integers determined by the loop's execution)**
