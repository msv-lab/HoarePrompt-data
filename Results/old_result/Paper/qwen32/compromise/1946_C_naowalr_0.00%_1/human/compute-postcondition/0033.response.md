The code assigns the value of `x` to `L`. Given the conditions in the initial state, `x` is either 25001 or 75001. Therefore, `L` will take the same value as `x`.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the vertices `b` that are directly connected to `a` by an edge; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is an integer such that 0 < k < n; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `numCuts` is 0; If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001, and `x` is 75001. Otherwise, `L` is 1, `R` is 50001, `numCuts` is 1, and `x` is 25001; `L` is equal to `x`.**
