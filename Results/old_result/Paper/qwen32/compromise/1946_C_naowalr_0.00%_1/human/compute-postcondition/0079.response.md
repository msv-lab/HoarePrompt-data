Postcondition: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each `adj[a]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `a` as specified by the input pairs; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `L` is either 1 or 50001; `R` is either 50001, 100001, 25001, or 75001; `numCuts` is 0; `z` is 1; `t` is some integer greater than 1; `i` is `n - 1`; `x` is either 25001 or 75001; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `R` remains 50001 or 100001. Otherwise, `R` is set to `x`.**
