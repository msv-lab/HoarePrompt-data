Postcondition: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each `adj[a]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `a` as specified by the input pairs; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `L` is either 1 or 50001; `R` is either 50001 or 100001; `numCuts` is either greater than `k` or equal to `k` with `leftover` being greater than or equal to `x` if `numCuts` is equal to `k`; `z` is 1; `t` is some integer greater than 1; `i` is `n - 1`; `x` is 50001; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`. Specifically, if `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is set to 50001 and `R` remains 100001. Otherwise, `L` remains 1 and `R` is set to 50001.**
