The code appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Given the initial state, `adj[b]` already includes `a` appended twice to its previous contents. After executing the code, `adj[b]` will include `a` three times.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2; `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input; `adj[a]` includes `b` appended twice to its previous contents; `adj[b]` includes `a` appended three times to its previous contents; `i` is `i + 1`.**
