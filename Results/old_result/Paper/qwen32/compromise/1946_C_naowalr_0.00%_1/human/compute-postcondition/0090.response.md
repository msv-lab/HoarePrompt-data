The code snippet reads two integers from standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means the values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the input provided. All other variables (`adj`, `numCuts`, `i`, `L`, `R`, and `z`) remain unchanged except that `z` is incremented by 1.

Given that `L` and `R` are two consecutive integers and the loop will terminate, these conditions remain valid post-execution. The variables `adj`, `numCuts`, `i`, `L`, and `R` retain their initial values. The variable `z` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`L` and `R` are two consecutive integers, the loop will terminate, `adj`, `numCuts`, `i` remain unchanged, `n` and `k` are assigned new integer values from input, `z` is incremented by 1.**
