The code reads a line from standard input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state specifies that `n` must be at least 2, but this condition does not affect the execution of the given code snippet. After the code executes, `a` and `b` will hold the integer values read from the input.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2; `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input.**
