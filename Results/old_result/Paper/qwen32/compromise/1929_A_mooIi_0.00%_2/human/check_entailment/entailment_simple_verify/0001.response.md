### Reasoning:
The original assessment is **correct**. The provided program does not solve the problem as described. Instead of calculating the maximum beauty of the array after rearranging its elements, the program merely sorts the array and prints it.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown using the annotated version of the code:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the elements of the array `ar`.

2. **Sorting**: The array `ar` is sorted in ascending order.

3. **Output**: The sorted array is converted to a space-separated string and printed.

The original assessment correctly points out that the program does not compute the beauty of the array. To compute the beauty, the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array need to be summed up.

Here’s the corrected version of the program, as suggested in the original assessment:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        beauty = sum(ar[i] - ar[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)

func()
```

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False** 

The original program is incorrect because it does not compute the maximum beauty of the array as required by the problem description.
