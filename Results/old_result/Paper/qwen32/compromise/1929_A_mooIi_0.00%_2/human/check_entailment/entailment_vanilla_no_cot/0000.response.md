Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program reads the input, sorts the array, converts the sorted array to strings, and prints the sorted array as a space-separated string. However, the task is to calculate and print the maximum beauty of the array, which is the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n after rearranging the elements of the array to maximize this sum.

To solve the problem correctly, Sasha should sort the array and then calculate the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. The provided program does not perform this calculation and instead just outputs the sorted array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
