Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it sorts the list of integers in ascending order and prints them as a space-separated string. The number of test cases `t` is specified initially, and the function handles up to 500 test cases. The integers in each list can be as large as \(10^9\).**
