You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. Each of the following n lines contains two integers a and x, where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9. a=1 indicates k must be greater than or equal to x, a=2 indicates k must be less than or equal to x, and a=3 indicates k must be not equal to x. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same (all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy all the given constraints. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Range**:
   - The program calculates the range of valid \( k \) values using `max(big)` and `min(less)`. However, it does not correctly count the number of integers within this range that do not violate the "not equal" constraints.
   - The loop `for i in range(max(big), min(less))` only finds the first valid integer \( k \) and breaks out of the loop, which is incorrect. It should count all valid integers in the range.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the range defined by `max(big)` and `min(less)` is invalid (i.e., `max(big) > min(less)`). In such cases, the answer should be 0, but the current program will print an incorrect value.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the first valid integer found in the range instead of the count of all valid integers.

Here is a corrected version of the program to illustrate the proper approach:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        big = []
        no = set()
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            (x, a) = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.add(a)
        min_val = max(big)
        max_val = min(less)
        if min_val > max_val:
            print(0)
        else:
            count = 0
            for i in range(min_val, max_val + 1):
                if i not in no:
                    count += 1
            print(count)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

In the corrected version, the program:
- Uses `max(big)` and `min(less)` to determine the valid range for \( k \).
- Checks if the range is valid (i.e., `min_val <= max_val`).
- Counts all integers within the valid range that are not in the `no` set.
- Prints the count of valid integers for each test case.

The original program fails to correctly count all valid integers and handle edge cases, hence it is incorrect.
