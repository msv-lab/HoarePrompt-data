The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a set of constraints on an integer `k`. For each test case, it determines the smallest integer `k` that satisfies all given constraints and prints this value. The constraints specify that `k` must be greater than or equal to certain values, less than or equal to certain values, and not equal to certain values.
