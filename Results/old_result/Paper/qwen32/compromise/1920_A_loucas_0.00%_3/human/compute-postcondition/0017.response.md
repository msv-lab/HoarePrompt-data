Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the second integer from the input, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing the single element `a`, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is any other value, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `big` and `less` are empty lists.**
