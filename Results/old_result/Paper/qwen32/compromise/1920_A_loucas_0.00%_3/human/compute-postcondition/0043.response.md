The value of `num` is assigned the value of `i`. The other variables, `big` and `less`, remain unchanged, and the precondition that `max(big) < min(less)` continues to hold. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` now holds a new value, which is its previous value plus one.

Output State: **`big` is a list or iterable with a maximum value, `less` is a list or iterable with a minimum value such that `max(big) < min(less)`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `num` is equal to the previous value of `i`.**
