Postcondition: **`num` is 0 if `i` is in `no`, otherwise `num` is `i`. `iterable` is `iterable + innerLoop`, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is unchanged, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `big` is [1], `less` is [2], and `no` contains all `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2. If `i` is not in `no`, the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
