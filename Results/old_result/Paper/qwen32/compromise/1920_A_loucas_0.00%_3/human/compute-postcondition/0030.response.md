Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `loop` is greater than 0; `iterable` is 0; `num` is 0; `innerLoop` is greater than 0; `x` is the first integer from the new input; `a` is the second integer from the new input; `iterable2` is 2. If `x` is 2, `less` contains the value of `a` appended to it; otherwise, `no` contains the value of `a`. `big` and `less` or `no` are lists based on the previous value of `x`.**
