Postcondition: **`big` is a list or iterable with a maximum value, `less` is a list or iterable with a minimum value such that `max(big) < min(less)`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `i` is not in `no`, `num` is set to the previous value of `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is in `no`, `num` is not set and the loop or if statement does not break.**
