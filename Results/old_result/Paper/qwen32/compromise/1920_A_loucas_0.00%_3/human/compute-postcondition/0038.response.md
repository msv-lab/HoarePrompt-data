The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `big`, and `less`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `max(big)` and `min(less)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last value that was processed within the range, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 and still within the range `[max(big), min(less))`.

Since the state of `big` and `less` does not change in the loop head, we only need to adjust `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last value that was processed, so for the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.

State: **`big` is a list or iterable with a maximum value, `less` is a list or iterable with a minimum value such that `max(big) < min(less)`, `i` is `i + 1`**
