Output State: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is `iterable + 1`, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop` after the final iteration.**

Explanation: The line `no = []` reinitializes the list `no` to be an empty list. All other variables retain their initial values as they are not affected by this line of code.
