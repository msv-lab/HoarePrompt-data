The `break` statement will exit the innermost loop, but it will not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `num`, `iterable`, `loop`, `innerLoop`, `big`, `less`, `no`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that the loop is exited.

Output State: **`num` is `i`, `iterable` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` is a list with at least one element, `less` is a list with at least one element where `min(less) > max(big)`, `no` contains all `a` values where the corresponding `x` was neither 1 nor 2, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop` after the final iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop.**
