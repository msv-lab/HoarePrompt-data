To ensure that the provided for loop executes, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means we need to adjust the state such that `int(input())` results in a value that is at least 1, because the loop will only execute if this value is greater than 0.

Let's break down the requirements:

1. **Input Value (`t`)**: The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the integer read from the input. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be at least 1. The problem statement already specifies that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, which satisfies this requirement.

2. **Adjusting the State**: The state before the loop starts should ensure that the input value `t` is at least 1. Given that `t` is already constrained by the problem statement to be within the range 1 to 10,000, we don't need to adjust `t` itself in the state description. However, we need to make sure that the input function `input()` returns a value that corresponds to this constraint.

Since the problem specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, and this is the only constraint we need to satisfy for the loop to execute, we can state the initial condition as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `input()` returns a string that can be converted to an integer within this range.**

However, since the problem statement already ensures that `t` is within the given range, we can simplify the state to just reflect the given constraints on `t` without explicitly mentioning the input function.

Final State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**

This state ensures that the loop will execute at least once.
