The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string values, converts each of those string values to an integer, and stores them in a list named `a`. This operation does not affect the values of `l`, `r`, `end`, `ans`, or `n`. The only change is the creation of the list `a` from the input.

Output State: **`l` remains 0, `r` remains 0, `end` is either 0 or 1, `ans` is -1 if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise `ans` is `len(a) - 1` if `st == 0` and `end == 0`, or `ans` is 0 if `st` is not 0 or `end` is not 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from input.**
