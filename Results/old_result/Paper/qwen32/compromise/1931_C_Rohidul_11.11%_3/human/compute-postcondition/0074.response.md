Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `end` is 0, `ans` is -1 if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise `ans` is `len(a) - 1` if `st == 0` and `end == 0`, or `ans` is 0 if `st` is not 0 or `end` is not 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `st` is 0**

In this state, `st` and `end` have been explicitly set to 0. The values of `l`, `r`, `ans`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
