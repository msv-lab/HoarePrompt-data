Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers; `l` is the first index `k` where `a[k] != a[k + 1]` or `n - 1` if all elements are equal; `r` is `l`; `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from index 0; `end` is the count of consecutive equal elements at the end of the list; the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`; either `st` is not 0, or `end` is not 0, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`**
