Initial State: `l` is 0, `r` must be at least 1, `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, `end` is increased by 1

The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. This means `r` will now be `r - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `r - 1` (and must be at least 0), `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, `end` is increased by 1**

Natural language: After executing the code, `r` is decreased by 1, so `r` is now `r - 1` and must be at least 0. The values of `l`, `a[r]`, and `end` remain unchanged.
