`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `l` remains 0, `r` remains 0, `end` is either 0 or 1, and `ans` is determined based on the initial conditions provided.

Output State: **`l` remains 0, `r` remains 0, `end` is either 0 or 1, `ans` is -1 if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise `ans` is `len(a) - 1` if `st == 0` and `end == 0`, or `ans` is 0 if `st` is not 0 or `end` is not 0, `n` is an input integer**.
