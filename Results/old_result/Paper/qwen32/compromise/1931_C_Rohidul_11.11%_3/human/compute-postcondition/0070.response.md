In the given task, the loop head only contains the loop variable `_` which is not explicitly used within the loop body and is derived from the `range(int(input()))`. Since the loop variable `_` is not relevant to the state of `l`, `r`, `end`, `a`, `ans`, or `st`, we need to focus on the conditions that allow the loop to execute again based on the input.

The loop will execute for the number of times specified by the integer input. Therefore, the state we need to adjust is the input itself (which is not directly a variable in the provided state but dictates how many times the loop will run).

However, since we are only allowed to adjust the states of objects in the loop head and the loop head does not contain any variables that directly influence the loop's continuation (other than the implicit input), and since the provided state does not include the input value, we cannot directly modify the input.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop remains the same as the provided state because no variables in the loop head need adjustment to determine the continuation of the loop.

State: **`l` remains 0, `r` remains 0, `end` is either 0 or 1. If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, `ans` is -1. Otherwise, `ans` is `len(a) - 1` if `st == 0` and `end == 0`, or `ans` is 0 if `st` is not 0 or `end` is not 0**.
