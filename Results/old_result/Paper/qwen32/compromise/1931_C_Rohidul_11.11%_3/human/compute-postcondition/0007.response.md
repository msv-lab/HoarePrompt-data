The code snippet `st += 1` increments the value of the variable `st` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and `n` must be at least 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input where `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]`; `l` is 1; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 1; `end` is 0.**
