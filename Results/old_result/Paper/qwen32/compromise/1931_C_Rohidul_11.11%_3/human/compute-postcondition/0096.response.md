The given code snippet assigns the value of `r - l - 1` to the variable `ans`. Given the initial state, `l` and `r` are both `0`, so the expression `r - l - 1` evaluates to `-1`. The other variables (`end`, `st`, and the first and last elements of `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is `0`, `r` is `0`, `end` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `-1`, `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the start, and the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.**
