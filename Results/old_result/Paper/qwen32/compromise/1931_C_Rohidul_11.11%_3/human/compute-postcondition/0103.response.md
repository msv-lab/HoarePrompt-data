Postcondition: **`l` is `0`, `r` is `0`, `end` is `n - 1`, `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the start. If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is `-1`. Otherwise, if `st` is `0` and `end` is `0`, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `0`.**
