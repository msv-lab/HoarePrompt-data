The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `l` and the value `n - 1` to the variable `r`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`.**
