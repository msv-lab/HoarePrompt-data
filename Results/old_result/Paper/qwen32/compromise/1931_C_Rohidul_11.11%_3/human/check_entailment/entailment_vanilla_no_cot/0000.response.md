Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The current implementation does not account for the optimal placement of the operation to minimize the cost. It only checks the longest contiguous segments at the beginning and end that are the same and makes assumptions about the cost based on those segments, which is not sufficient to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to consider all possible values that the array could be set to and calculate the minimum cost for each of those values, taking into account the optimal placement of the operation. This would likely involve dynamic programming or a more sophisticated approach to find the minimal cost efficiently.
