Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the user's input, `b` is the user's input, and `i` is `i + 2`. If `n` is not equal to 1, `no_path` is `True` if for all `k` in `[0, 2, 4, ..., n-2]`, `b[k]` is `'>'` and for all `k` in `[1, 3, 5, ..., n-2]`, `a[k]` is `'>'`. Otherwise, `no_path` is `False`.**
