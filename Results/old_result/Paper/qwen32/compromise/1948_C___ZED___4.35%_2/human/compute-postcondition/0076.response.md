Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer greater than 6.
- `a` and `b` are the new input strings.
- `i` is `i + 1` (Note: This doesn't define `i` explicitly; it seems to imply `i` is being incremented by 1, but its initial value is not given).
- `k` is 5.
- `no_path` is False if `a[k]` is not '>'; otherwise, `no_path` remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `k` is explicitly set to 5 in the initial state.
- The `print(k)` statement will output the value of `k`.

### Conclusion:
The value of `k` is explicitly given as 5. Therefore, when the `print(k)` statement is executed, it will print the value 5.

Output: **5**
