The code snippet assigns a new value to `n` by converting user input to an integer. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are strings, and `i` is `i + 2`**.
