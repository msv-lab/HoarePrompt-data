Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string, and `b` is a string with the second-to-last character '>'. If `n` is 1, the postcondition is as given in the precondition. If `n` is greater than 1, and `no_path` is `False`, `k` is the largest odd number less than `n-1` and every character at an odd index in `a` is '>'. If `no_path` is `True`, `k` is not defined in this context.**
