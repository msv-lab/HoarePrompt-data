Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer greater than 2.
- `a` is the user's input (implying it could be a string or a list, depending on how the user input is interpreted).
- `b` is the user's input (similarly, could be a string or a list).
- `i` is `i + 2` (unchanged), which suggests that `i` is likely a loop index or a counter that is incremented by 2, but its initial value is not specified.
- `k` is `k + 2`. This also suggests that `k` is a loop index or a counter that is incremented by 2, but its initial value is not specified.
- If `a[k]` is not equal to '>', then `no_path` is set to False. However, this variable is not used in the `print` statement, so it doesn't affect the output.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `k` is incremented by 2, but its initial value is not provided. Therefore, we can only express the output in terms of its initial value.
- Let's denote the initial value of `k` as `k_initial`.
- After the operation `k = k + 2`, the value of `k` becomes `k_initial + 2`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the value of `k` after it has been incremented by 2. Since the initial value of `k` is not provided, we can only express the output in terms of `k_initial`.

Output: **k_initial + 2 (where k_initial is the initial value of k)**
