The given code snippet simply sets the variable `no_path` to `False`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `k`) are not modified by this code snippet. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `a` is the user's input; `b` is the user's input; `i` is `i + 2` (unchanged); `k` is `k + 2` (unchanged); `no_path` is False.**
