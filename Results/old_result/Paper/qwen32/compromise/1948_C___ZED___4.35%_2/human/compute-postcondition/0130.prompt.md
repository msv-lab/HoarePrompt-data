Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. Each of the two strings representing the rows of the grid consists of exactly n characters, where each character is either '<' or '>'. There are no arrows pointing outside the grid.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    if b[-2] != '>':
        print('NO')
    elif n == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        no_path = True
        for k in range(0, n, 2):
            if b[k] != '>':
                no_path = False
        if not no_path:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                print(k)
                if a[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
        if no_path:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string, and `b` is an input string. If the second-to-last character of `b` is not '>', the conditions remain as given in the precondition. If the second-to-last character of `b` is '>', and `n` is 1, the conditions remain as given in the precondition. If `n` is greater than 1 and `no_path` is `False`, `k` is the largest odd number less than `n-1` and every character at an odd index in `a` is '>'. If `no_path` is `True`, `k` is not defined in this context.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` and `b` are strings, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `b[-2]` is not `'>'`, the state of `no_path` remains unchanged. If `b[-2]` is `'>'` and `n == 1`, the state of `no_path` remains unchanged. If `b[-2]` is `'>'` and `n > 1`, then any character at an odd index in `a` (from 1 to the largest odd number less than `n-1`) is `'>'` if `no_path` was initially `False`, and `no_path` remains `False`. If `no_path` was initially `True`, it remains `True`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the user's input, `b` is the user's input, and `i` is `i + 2`. If `b[-2]` is not equal to `'>'`, and `n` is not equal to 1, `no_path` is `True` if for all `k` in `[0, 2, 4, ..., n-2]`, `b[k]` is `'>'` and for all `k` in `[1, 3, 5, ..., n-2]`, `a[k]` is `'>'`. Otherwise, `no_path` is `False`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
