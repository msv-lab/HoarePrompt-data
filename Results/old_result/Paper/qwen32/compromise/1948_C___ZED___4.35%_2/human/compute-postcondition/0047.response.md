The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to be the integer value of the input. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `no_path`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string, `b` is an input string, `i` is `i + 1`, and `no_path` is a boolean value.**
