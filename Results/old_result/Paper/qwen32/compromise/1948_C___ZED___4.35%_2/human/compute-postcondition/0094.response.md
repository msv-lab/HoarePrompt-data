The code snippet assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `no_path`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or `i`) are affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the user's input, `b` is the user's input, `i` is `i + 2`, `no_path` is True.**
