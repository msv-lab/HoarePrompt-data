Let's analyze the provided program and verify its correctness based on the problem description and the function summaries.

### Analysis

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if a given array `a` of length `n` can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the operation of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them.
- The operation can be performed any number of times.

#### Program Code Recap:
- **func_1(a)**: This function checks if the array `a` can be sorted by concatenating `a` with itself and checking if any subarray of length `n` in this concatenated array matches the sorted version of `a`.
- **func_2()**: This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each using `func_1`, and prints the results.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- `func_2` reads input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Evaluation of `func_1`
The key logic in `func_1` is to check if any subarray of length `n` in the concatenated array `a + a` matches the sorted version of `a`. This is a clever approach because if the array can be split and swapped to form a sorted array, then the sorted array must appear as a contiguous subarray in the doubled array.

Let's reason through this:
1. **Concatenation**: By concatenating `a` with itself, we create a scenario where any possible split and swap of `a` can be represented as a subarray of `a + a`.
2. **Subarray Check**: The function checks every possible subarray of length `n` in `a + a` to see if it matches the sorted version of `a`.

This approach is correct because:
- If `a` can be sorted by splitting and swapping, the sorted version will appear as a contiguous subarray in `a + a`.
- If no such subarray exists, then it is impossible to sort `a` using the described operation.

### Evaluation of `func_2`
The function `func_2` correctly reads multiple test cases, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results. This part of the program is straightforward and correctly implemented based on the problem description.

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping. The concatenation and subarray check in `func_1` is a valid and efficient approach to solve the problem. The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
