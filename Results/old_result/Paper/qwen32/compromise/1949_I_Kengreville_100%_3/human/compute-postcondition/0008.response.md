Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is the first integer from each line of input, `y` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is the second integer from each line of input, `r` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is the third integer from each line of input, `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to False, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is a variable used to keep track of the bipartiteness during the DFS traversal respectively.**

Explanation: The value of `tot` is set to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
