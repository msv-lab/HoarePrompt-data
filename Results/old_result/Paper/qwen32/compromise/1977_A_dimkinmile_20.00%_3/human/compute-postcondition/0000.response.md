The provided code snippet reads a single line of input containing two integers, `n` and `m`, which represent the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively. The code uses the `map` function to convert the input string into integers and assigns them to `n` and `m`.

Initial State: The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.

After executing the code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())`, the variables `n` and `m` will hold the integer values read from the input.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers read from the input, where `n` represents the number of moves and `m` represents the desired number of cubes in the tower.**
