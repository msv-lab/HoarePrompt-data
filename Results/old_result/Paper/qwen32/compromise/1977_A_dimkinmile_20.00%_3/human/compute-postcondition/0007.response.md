Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, where `n` is the number of moves and `m` is the desired number of cubes in the tower. It then prints "Yes" if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, otherwise it prints "No".**
