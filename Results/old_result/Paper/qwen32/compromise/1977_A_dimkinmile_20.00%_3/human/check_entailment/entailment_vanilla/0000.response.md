Reasoning:
The task is to determine if it's possible to have a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove exactly one cube. 

The provided program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`. The program then checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and prints "Yes" if true, otherwise it prints "No".

However, this logic is incorrect. The number of moves `n` must be able to accommodate the difference between the final number of cubes `m` and the initial number of cubes (which is 0). Specifically, the number of moves `n` must be at least `m` (if `m` is positive) because each cube added requires one move. Moreover, `n` must be such that it can also account for any necessary removals of cubes if `m` is less than the maximum number of cubes that could be added (which is `n`). 

The correct condition should be that `n` must be at least `m` and `n - m` must be even (because for every cube added, there must be a way to balance the moves, and the difference `n - m` must be an even number to account for both additions and removals).

However, the given program only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which does not fully cover the requirement for the problem. For example, if `n = 3` and `m = 2`, the program would output "Yes", but in reality, this is not possible because Nikita would need to add 2 cubes and then remove 1, which would require an odd number of moves, not an even number. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
