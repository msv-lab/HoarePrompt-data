### Reasoning:
The program is designed to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove a single cube from the tower. The key insight is that the number of moves `n` must be at least as large as the number of cubes `m` to achieve the desired configuration. This is because the worst-case scenario is that Nikita removes cubes until the tower is empty and then starts adding cubes, which requires `m` moves to add `m` cubes.

Let's break down the logic of the program:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
- It then checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.
  - If true, it prints "Yes", indicating that it is possible to have a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
  - If false, it prints "No", indicating that it is not possible to have a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves.

This logic is correct based on the problem description. If `n` is less than `m`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes because even if all moves were additions, the maximum number of cubes would be `n`, which is less than `m`. Conversely, if `n` is equal to or greater than `m`, it is possible to achieve the desired number of cubes.
