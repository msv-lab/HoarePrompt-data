Each test case consists of two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100), where n represents the number of moves Nikita can make and m represents the desired number of cubes in the tower. The input starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases, followed by t lines, each containing a pair of integers n and m.
