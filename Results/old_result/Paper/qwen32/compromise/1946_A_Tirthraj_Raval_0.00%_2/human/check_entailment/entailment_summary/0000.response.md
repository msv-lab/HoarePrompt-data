Reasoning:  
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. However, the code only sorts the array and counts the occurrences of the median element, which does not help in determining the number of operations needed to increase the median.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the median of the array, then determine the minimum number of increments required to make the median larger than its current value. This involves identifying the smallest elements that need to be incremented to shift the median to the next higher value.

Correctness: **False**
