Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element a_i in a; `num2` is an integer representing the length of the array `a`, such that `num2` == len(a); `order` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `order` is assigned the value 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
