The value of `order` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables (`a`, `num2`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element a_i in a; `num2` is an integer representing the length of the array `a`, such that `num2` > 1; If `a[i - 1] >= a[i]`, then `order` was set to 1, otherwise `order` was 0, and now `order` is `order + 1`; `i` is `num2 - 1`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element a_i in a; `num2` is an integer representing the length of the array `a`, such that `num2` > 1; If `a[i - 1] >= a[i]`, then `order` was set to 1, otherwise `order` was 0, and now `order` is `order + 1`; `i` is `num2 - 1`.**
