Postcondition: **`T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input with `x` greater than 1; `list0` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`. If `num` equals 1, `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.**
