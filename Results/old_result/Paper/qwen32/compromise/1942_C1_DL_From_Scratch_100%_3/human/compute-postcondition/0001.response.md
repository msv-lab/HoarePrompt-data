The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `T`. The loop will execute if `T` is at least 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate `T` times, so its initial value doesn't need to be specified before the loop starts. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of vertices) are defined inside the loop body and do not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `T` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1**
