The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the values of `path`, `n`, `input`, `data`, `t`, and `index` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`path` is a string of space-separated integers representing the periodicities of the signs, `n` is an integer representing the number of signs such that 1 <= n <= 100, `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings where each string is an integer from `path`, `t` is the integer value of the first element of `data`, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list.**
