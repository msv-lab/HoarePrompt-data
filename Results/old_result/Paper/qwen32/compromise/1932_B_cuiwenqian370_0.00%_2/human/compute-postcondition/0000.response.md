The provided code snippet `input = sys.stdin.read` assigns the `sys.stdin.read` function to the variable `input`. This means that `input` will now refer to the function that reads from the standard input until EOF (End of File) is reached, rather than the built-in `input()` function.

Since the initial state specifies that `path` is a string of space-separated integers and `n` is an integer, these variables are not affected by the code snippet. The only change is the reassignment of the `input` variable.

Output State: **`path` is a string of space-separated integers representing the periodicities of the signs, `n` is an integer representing the number of signs such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`.**
