Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The code appears to be designed for a different problem involving sequences of '@' and '*' characters, which is unrelated to determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur based on their periodicities.

Let's break down the issues in the provided code:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is intended to process a sequence of characters ('@' and '*') and count the maximum number of '@' characters while considering certain constraints ('*').
   - It does not incorporate any logic to handle the periodicity of signs or determine the year in which each sign will occur.
   - The function does not use the periodicity information (which is necessary for solving the problem) and instead focuses on counting '@' characters.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` with a path (which is not relevant to the problem of determining the year of the n-th sign).
   - The results from `func_1` are printed, but they do not correspond to the years in which the n-th sign occurs.

The problem requires finding the year in which each sign occurs sequentially based on its periodicity. A correct approach involves iterating through each test case, and for each sign, finding the next occurrence year based on its periodicity, starting from the year after the previous sign occurred.

The correct implementation provided in the original assessment accurately solves the problem by iterating through the periodicities and calculating the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

Final: **False**
