Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to handle a different type of problem, likely related to some kind of sequence or path analysis involving '@' and '*' characters. However, the problem described requires calculating the year in which the n-th sign occurs based on the periodicities of the signs.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should iterate through each test case, and for each sign, calculate the next occurrence year starting from the year after the previous sign occurred. Here's a correct implementation:

```python
def calculate_apocalypse_year(periodicities):
    current_year = 0
    for period in periodicities:
        # Find the next occurrence of the sign after the current year
        current_year = ((current_year // period) + 1) * period
    return current_year

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        periodicities = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        results.append(calculate_apocalypse_year(periodicities))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This implementation reads the input, processes each test case, and calculates the correct year for the n-th sign to occur based on the given periodicities.
