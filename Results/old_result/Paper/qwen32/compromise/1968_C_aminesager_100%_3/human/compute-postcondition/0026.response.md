The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` becomes 3. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound for the loop.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the input string `line`, `a` is a list containing the integers `[1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1]]`, `i` is 3, `result` is a string that is the space-separated representation of the list `a`, `line` is the input string.**
