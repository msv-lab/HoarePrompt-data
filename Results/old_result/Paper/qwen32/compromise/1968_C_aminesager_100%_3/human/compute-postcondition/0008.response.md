The code snippet `a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])` appends a new value to the list `a`. This new value is the sum of the last element of `a` (which is `a[i - 1]`) and the element at index `i - 1` in the list `T`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1.
- `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1.
- `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the input string `line`.
- `a` is a list containing the integer `1000`.

After executing the code:
- The list `a` will have an additional element, which is the sum of the last element of `a` and the element at index `i - 1` in `T`.

Since `a` initially contains only one element, `1000`, the new element appended will be `1000 + T[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1; `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the input string `line`; `a` is a list containing the integers `1000` and `1000 + T[i - 1]`.**
