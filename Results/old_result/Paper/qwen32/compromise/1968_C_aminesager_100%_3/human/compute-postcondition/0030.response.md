To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is `t - 1` (Note: This seems to be a redundant statement as `t` is not defined in the initial state and its value is not used anywhere in the given snippet. We can ignore this for the purpose of this task.)
2. `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
3. `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the input string `line`.
4. `a` is a list defined as:
   - `a[0] = 1000`
   - `a[1] = 1000 + T[0]`
   - `a[2] = 1000 + T[0] + T[1]`
   - ...
   - `a[n-1] = 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]`
5. `i` is `n` (Note: This variable `i` is not used in the given code snippet.)
6. `result` is a space-separated string representation of the list `a`.
7. `line` is the input string.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(result)
```

### Explanation:
To understand what `result` will be, we need to understand the list `a` and its construction:
- The list `a` starts with the value `1000`.
- Each subsequent element in `a` is the sum of `1000` and the cumulative sum of the first `k` elements of `T` where `k` ranges from 0 to `n-2`.

Given that `result` is a space-separated string representation of the list `a`, the output will be a string of these calculated values separated by spaces.

### Example Calculation:
Assume `n = 4` and `line = "10 20 30"`, then `T = [10, 20, 30]`.

- `a[0] = 1000`
- `a[1] = 1000 + T[0] = 1000 + 10 = 1010`
- `a[2] = 1000 + T[0] + T[1] = 1000 + 10 + 20 = 1030`
- `a[3] = 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + T[2] = 1000 + 10 + 20 + 30 = 1060`

Thus, `a = [1000, 1010, 1030, 1060]` and `result = "1000 1010 1030 1060"`.

### General Output:
Since the exact values of `n` and `T` are not provided, we describe the output in a general form.

Output: **result (where result is a space-separated string of the list `a` consisting of the values 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2])**
