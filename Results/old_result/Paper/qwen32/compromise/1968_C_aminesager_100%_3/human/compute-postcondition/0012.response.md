The code appends a new element to the list `a`. This element is the sum of the last element of `a` (which is `a[i - 1]` or `a[2]`) and the element `T[i - 1]` (which is `T[2]`).

Given:
- `a[2]` is `1000 + T[0] + T[1]`
- `T[2]` is the third element of the list `T`

The new element appended to `a` will be:
\[ a[3] = a[2] + T[2] = (1000 + T[0] + T[1]) + T[2] \]

Thus, the list `a` will now have 4 elements:
\[ a = [1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + T[2]] \]

The values of `t`, `n`, and `T` remain unchanged. The value of `i` remains 3 as well, since it is not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1; `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the input string `line`; `a` is a list containing the integers `1000`, `1000 + T[0]`, `1000 + T[0] + T[1]`, and `1000 + T[0] + T[1] + T[2]`; `i` is 3**
