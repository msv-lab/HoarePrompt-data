The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n-1` integers. It constructs an array `a` of length `n` by setting the first element to 1000 and each subsequent element to the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in the input list. It then prints the resulting array `a` for each test case.
