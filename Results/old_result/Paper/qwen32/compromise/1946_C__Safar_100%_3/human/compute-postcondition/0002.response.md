Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed, `stack` is `[(1, 1)]`, `visited` is an empty set, `d` is `{1: 1}`.**

In this output state, the variable `d` has been updated to be a dictionary with the key `1` and the value `1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
