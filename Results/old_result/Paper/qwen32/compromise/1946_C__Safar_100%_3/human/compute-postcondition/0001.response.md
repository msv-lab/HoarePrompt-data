The code initializes a set named `visited`. This set will be used to keep track of the vertices that have been visited in the tree. The values of `A`, `g`, `k`, and `stack` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed, `stack` is `[(1, 1)]`, `visited` is an empty set.**
