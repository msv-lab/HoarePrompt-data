Output State: **The program returns `prog_cities`, a list of `n - 1` elements where each element `prog_cities[i]` is either `1` if `cities[i + 1]` is closer to `cities[i]` than `cities[i - 1]`, or the distance to the next city `cities[i + 1]` otherwise.**

This means that for each city (except the last one) in the `cities` list, the `prog_cities` list will contain either `1` if the next city is the closest, or the distance to the next city if it is not the closest.
