Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `cities`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case includes the number of cities `n`, a list of coordinates for these cities, the number of queries `m`, and a list of query pairs. For each city in each test case, the function determines whether the next city is closer than the previous city and returns a list of `n - 1` elements. Each element in this list is either `1` if the next city is closer, or the distance to the next city otherwise.**
