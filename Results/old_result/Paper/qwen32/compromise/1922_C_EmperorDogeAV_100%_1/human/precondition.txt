cities is a list of integers representing the coordinates of n cities on the number line such that 2 <= n <= 10^5 and 0 <= cities[i] < cities[i+1] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n-1. The function go_through is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes the list of city coordinates and a list of queries. Each query is a tuple of two integers (x_i, y_i) where 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n and x_i != y_i. The function should be able to process up to 10^4 test cases, with the total number of cities and queries across all test cases not exceeding 10^5.
