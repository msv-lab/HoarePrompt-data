You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
    return prog_cities



- Function Summary: 
The function takes a list of city coordinates and determines for each city (except the last one) whether the next city is the closest city. If the next city is the closest, it marks that position in the result list with `1`. Otherwise, it stores the distance to the next city in the result list. The function returns this list of `n - 1` elements.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, their coordinates `cities`, the number of queries `m`, and the queries themselves.

2. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The code defines a function `func_1` that calculates the cost to move to the closest city for each city, except the last one in the list.
   - The function iterates through the list of cities and determines whether the closest city is the next city (forward) or the previous city (backward).
   - If the closest city is forward, it assigns `1` to `prog_cities[i]`. Otherwise, it assigns the distance to the closest city (either forward or backward).

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The code calculates prefix sums for the forward and backward costs.
   - `pref_sum_f` stores the cumulative cost to move from the first city to each city using the closest city rule.
   - `pref_sum_b` stores the cumulative cost to move from the last city to each city using the closest city rule.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query `(a, b)`, the code determines whether to use the forward or backward prefix sums based on the order of `a` and `b`.
   - It then calculates the cost as the difference in prefix sums between the indices of `b` and `a`.

### Analysis of the Code

#### 1. Closest City Calculation (`func_1`):
- The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the cost to move to the closest city for each city except the last one.
- However, there is a mistake in the logic:
  - When determining the closest city, it should compare the distances to both the previous and next cities and choose the closest one.
  - The code incorrectly assigns `1` to `prog_cities[i]` if the closest city is forward, but it should assign the actual distance to the closest city.
  - Additionally, the code does not handle the case where the city is the first one in the list correctly (it should only consider the next city).

#### 2. Prefix Sum Calculation:
- The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are calculated based on the incorrect closest city costs from `func_1`.
- Since the closest city costs are incorrect, the prefix sums will also be incorrect.

#### 3. Query Processing:
- The query processing logic assumes that the prefix sums correctly represent the cost to move between cities using the closest city rule.
- Since the prefix sums are incorrect, the results of the queries will also be incorrect.

### Conclusion
The code contains logical errors in the calculation of the closest city costs, which propagate to the prefix sums and, consequently, the query results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
