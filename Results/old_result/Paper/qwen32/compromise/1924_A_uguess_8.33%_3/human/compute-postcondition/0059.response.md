The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments the variable `cur` by `2` raised to the power of `cur_ss`. Given that `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, the value of `cur` will be updated accordingly.

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is a user input string that must have at least one character, `cnt` is `0`, `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`, `i` remains unchanged, `tmp` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, and `(cur & 1 << cur_ss) == 0` is no longer valid because `cur` now includes the bit corresponding to `cur_ss`.**
