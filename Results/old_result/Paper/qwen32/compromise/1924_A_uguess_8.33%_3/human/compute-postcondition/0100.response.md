Postcondition: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cur`, and `tmp` remain the same as their initial values. `cnt` is the total number of times the first `k` bits in `cur` were all set to `1`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `cur` is `0` if the last `k`-bit sequence was complete, otherwise it holds the value of the incomplete sequence. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `i` is equal to `k`, `tmp` is the last character set in the loop or unchanged, and `ans` is updated to `ans + 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)`.**
