The only object in the loop head is the variable `ss`, which iterates over the string `s`. To ensure the loop executes, `s` must have at least one character. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `cnt`, `cur`, `i`, `tmp`, and `ans` do not affect the execution of the loop according to the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `s` contains at least one character.

State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is a user input string that must have at least one character, `cnt` is `0`, `cur` is `0`, `i` remains unchanged, `tmp` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged**
