The code snippet `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments the value of `cur` by `1 << cur_ss`. This means that the bit at position `cur_ss` in the binary representation of `cur` is set to 1.

Let's break down the impact of this code on the program:
- `cur_ss` is calculated as `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, which gives the 0-based index of the character `ss` in the alphabet.
- The expression `1 << cur_ss` creates a binary number with a 1 at the `cur_ss` position and 0s elsewhere.
- `cur` is then incremented by this value, effectively setting the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` to 1.

The conditions related to `cnt` are not affected by this operation, so `cnt` remains unchanged. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` are also not affected by this operation. The variable `ss` remains the same as it is not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a string read from the input that must have at least 1 character; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`; If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is set to `1 << cur_ss`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`; `cur` is incremented by `1 << cur_ss`.**
