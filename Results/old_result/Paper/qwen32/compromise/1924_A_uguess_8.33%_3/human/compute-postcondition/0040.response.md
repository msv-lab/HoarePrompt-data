The only variables in the loop head of the given `for` loop are `i` and `k`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` remains unchanged
- `n` remains unchanged
- `k` must be greater than 0
- `m` remains unchanged
- `s` remains unchanged
- `cnt` is less than `n` and holds the number of times a sequence of `k` distinct characters was found in the string `s`
- `cur` is 0 if the last processed subset of `k` distinct characters completed a sequence, or it will be a value reflecting the bits of the characters processed since the last completed sequence.
- `ans` is a string consisting of the character that is `k-1` positions after 'a' in the ASCII table, repeated `cnt` times.

From the loop statement `for i in range(k)`, we know that `i` ranges from 0 to `k-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken on some value less than `k`. To start the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

**Step-by-Step Adjustment:**
1. `i` at the end of the previous iteration was some value `x` where `0 <= x < k`. At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.
2. Since `k` remains unchanged, no adjustment is needed for `k`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `cnt` is less than `n` and holds the number of times a sequence of `k` distinct characters was found in the string `s`, `cur` will be 0 if the last processed subset of `k` distinct characters completed a sequence, or it will be a value reflecting the bits of the characters processed since the last completed sequence, `ans` is a string consisting of the character that is `k-1` positions after 'a' in the ASCII table, repeated `cnt` times, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since `i` at the end of the previous iteration was 0, 1, ..., `k-2`, the next value of `i` would be `1`, `2`, ..., `k-1` respectively. To generalize, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

Thus, if we assume the previous value of `i` was `x`, the next value of `i` should be `x + 1`. For the sake of a concrete example, if `i` was `0` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `1`.

State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `cnt` is less than `n` and holds the number of times a sequence of `k` distinct characters was found in the string `s`, `cur` will be 0 if the last processed subset of `k` distinct characters completed a sequence, or it will be a value reflecting the bits of the characters processed since the last completed sequence, `ans` is a string consisting of the character that is `k-1` positions after 'a' in the ASCII table, repeated `cnt` times, `i` is 1**.
