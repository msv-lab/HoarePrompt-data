Postcondition: **`t`, `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, `m`, `s`, `cur`, `cnt`, `i` remain unchanged; `cur_ss` is the position of the last character in `s` in the alphabet; `tmp` is an empty string; `ans` is a string consisting of the character at position `k-1` in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times; the current value of `cur` is such that the `i`-th bit is 0.**
