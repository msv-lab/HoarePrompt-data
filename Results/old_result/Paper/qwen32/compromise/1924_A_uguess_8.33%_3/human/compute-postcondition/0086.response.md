In the given task, the for loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(k):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`. To ensure that the loop executes, we need to make sure that `k` is greater than 0 because the loop will iterate `k` times. The variable `i` is the loop variable and its initial value is set automatically by the `range` function, so we do not need to adjust `i` before the loop starts.

The other variables mentioned (`t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `cur`, `tmp`, and `ans`) are not part of the loop head and are mentioned only in the context of what remains unchanged after the loop completes. Therefore, we do not need to adjust their states for the loop to execute.

So, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k` to ensure that the loop can execute.

State: **`k` must be greater than 0**
