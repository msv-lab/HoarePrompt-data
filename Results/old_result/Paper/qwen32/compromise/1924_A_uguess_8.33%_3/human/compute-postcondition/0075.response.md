Postcondition: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `tmp`, `ans` remain unchanged; `cur` is `cur + (1 << cur_ss)` unless it was `(1 << k) - 1` before the increment, in which case `cur` is `0`; `cnt` is `2` if `cur` was reset to `0`, otherwise `cnt` is `1`; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`. If `cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0`, `cur` is incremented by `(1 << cur_ss)` and `cnt` is set accordingly. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cur` and `cnt`.**
