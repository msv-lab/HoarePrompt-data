Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it checks if a given string contains at least `n` sequences of `k` distinct characters. It outputs "YES" if the condition is met. If not, it outputs "NO" followed by a constructed string that contains `cnt` sequences of `k` distinct characters plus additional characters to reach a total of `n` sequences.**
