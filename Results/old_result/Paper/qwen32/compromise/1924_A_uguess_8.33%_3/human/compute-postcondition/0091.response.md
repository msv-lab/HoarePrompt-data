Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `tmp` is the character corresponding to `ord('a') + i`.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `k` remains greater than 0. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. A new variable `tmp` is assigned the character that corresponds to the ASCII value of `ord('a') + i`.
