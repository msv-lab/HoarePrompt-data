To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information step by step.

1. **Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `cur`, `cnt`, `cur_ss` are unchanged.
   - `i` is set to `k`.
   - `tmp` is the last character at position `i` in the alphabet where `cur & 1 << i == 0`.
   - `ans` is a string constructed as follows:
     - The character at position `k-1` in the alphabet is repeated `cnt` times.
     - This is followed by the character `tmp`.
     - Then, `n - cnt - 1` 'a' characters are appended.

2. **Understanding `tmp`:**
   - `cur & 1 << i == 0` checks if the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `cur` is 0.
   - If the bit is 0, `tmp` is the character at position `i` in the alphabet (where 'a' is at position 0, 'b' is at position 1, ..., 'z' is at position 25).

3. **Constructing `ans`:**
   - The first part of `ans` is the character at position `k-1` in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times.
   - The second part is the character `tmp`.
   - The third part is `n - cnt - 1` 'a' characters.

4. **Formulating the Output:**
   - The character at position `k-1` in the alphabet is `chr(k-1 + ord('a'))`.
   - `tmp` is `chr(i + ord('a'))` if `cur & 1 << i == 0`.
   - `n - cnt - 1` determines the number of 'a' characters at the end.

Putting this all together, the output string `ans` can be described as:
- The character `chr(k-1 + ord('a'))` repeated `cnt` times.
- Followed by `tmp` if `cur & 1 << i == 0`.
- Followed by `n - cnt - 1` 'a' characters.

Thus, the final output is:

Output: **[character at position k-1 in the alphabet repeated cnt times][tmp (if cur & 1 << i == 0)][n - cnt - 1 'a' characters] (where tmp is the character at position i in the alphabet if cur & 1 << i == 0)**
