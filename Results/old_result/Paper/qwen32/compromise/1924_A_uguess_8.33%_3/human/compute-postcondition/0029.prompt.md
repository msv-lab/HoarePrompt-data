Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is the string read from the input; `cnt` is 0; `cur` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a string read from the input that must have at least 1 character; `cur_ss` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is set to `1 << cur_ss`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a string read from the input that must have at least 1 character; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is set to `cur | 1 << cur_ss`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1` before the if statement, then `cnt` is set to 1 and `cur` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `cur` retains its previous value. `ss` is the next character in the string `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a string read from the input that must have at least 1 character; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`; `cur_ss` is an integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is updated to the previous value of `cur` plus \(2^{cur\_ss}\). Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. If `cur` was equal to \((1 << k) - 1\), then `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `cur` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `cur` retains its updated value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
