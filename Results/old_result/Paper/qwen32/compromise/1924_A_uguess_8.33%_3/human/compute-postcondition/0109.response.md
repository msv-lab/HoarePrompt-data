The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments the variable `cur` by the value of `1` left-shifted by `cur_ss` bits. Given that `cur_ss` is 2, `1 << cur_ss` equals `1 << 2`, which is `4`. Therefore, `cur` is incremented by `4`. 

The initial value of `cur` is `0`, so after the operation, `cur` becomes `0 + 4`, which is `4`.

The other variables remain unchanged, and the precondition that the bitwise AND operation between `cur` and `1 << cur_ss` equals `0` is no longer valid because `cur` is now `4` and `1 << cur_ss` is `4`, and `4 & 4` equals `4`, not `0`.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `cur` is 4, `tmp`, `i`, `ans` remain the same as their initial values; `s` is a non-empty input string; `cnt` is 0; `cur_ss` is 2.**
