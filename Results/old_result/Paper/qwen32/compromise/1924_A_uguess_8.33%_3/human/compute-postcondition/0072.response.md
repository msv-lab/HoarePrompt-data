The only object in the loop head is the variable `ss` from the string `s`. Therefore, we need to adjust only `ss` for the loop to execute one more time. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, all variables except `ss` remain unchanged. The variable `ss` should be the next character in the string `s` for the loop to continue executing.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:
1. `ss` should be updated to the next character in the string `s`.
2. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `tmp`, `ans`, `cur`, `cnt`, `cur_ss`) remain unchanged.

State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `tmp`, `ans` remain unchanged, `cur` is reset to `0` if `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1` otherwise `cur` remains unchanged, `cnt` is `2` if `cur` was updated to `(1 << k) - 1` before the operation, otherwise `cnt` is `1`, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`**
