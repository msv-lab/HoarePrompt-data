The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` updates the variable `cur` by adding to it the value of `1` shifted left by `cur_ss` bits. This operation sets the `cur_ss`-th bit of `cur` to `1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5
- `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input
- `s` is a string read from the input that must have at least 1 character
- `cnt` is 0
- `cur` is 0
- `cur_ss` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`
- The condition `(cur & 1 << cur_ss) == 0` is true (indicating that the `cur_ss`-th bit of `cur` is initially 0)

After executing `cur += 1 << cur_ss`, the `cur_ss`-th bit of `cur` is set to 1, and no other variables are changed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a string read from the input that must have at least 1 character; `cnt` is 0; `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`; `cur_ss` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`.**
