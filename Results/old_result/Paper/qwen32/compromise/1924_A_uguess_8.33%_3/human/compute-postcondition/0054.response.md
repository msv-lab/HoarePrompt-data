The variable `cnt` is assigned the value `0`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` remains unchanged, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is the user input, `cnt` is `0`, `cur` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `tmp` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged.
