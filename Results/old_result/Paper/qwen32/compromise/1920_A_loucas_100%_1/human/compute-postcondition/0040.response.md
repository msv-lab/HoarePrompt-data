Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `less` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 2, `big` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 1, `no` is a list containing at least one element, `num` is `min(less) - max(big)`, and `innerLoop` is the number of iterations the loop ran. Additionally, `i` is an integer such that `i` is less than or equal to `min(less)` and `i` is greater than or equal to `max(big)`**

Explanation: The value of `num` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
