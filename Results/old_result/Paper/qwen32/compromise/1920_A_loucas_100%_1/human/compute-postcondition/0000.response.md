The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `loop`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are part of the precondition and are not affected by this single line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; for each test case, there are `n` lines containing two integers `a` and `x` where `a` ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9; `a = 1` indicates k must be greater than or equal to x, `a = 2` indicates k must be less than or equal to x, and `a = 3` indicates k must be not equal to x; `loop` is an integer representing the number of test cases.**
