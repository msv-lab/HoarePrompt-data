The given Python code snippet appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. This means that the list `no` will now include the current value of `a`.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- There are `n-1` lines remaining containing two integers `a` and `x` where `a` ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.
- `loop` remains greater than 0.
- `less` remains a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is 2.
- `big` remains a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is 1.
- `no` is now a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, plus the newly appended value of `a`.
- `num` remains 0.
- `innerLoop` remains greater than 0.
- `x` remains the first integer from the input.
- `a` remains the second integer from the input.
- `iterable2` remains incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, there are `n-1` lines remaining containing two integers `a` and `x` where `a` ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `loop` is greater than 0, `less` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is 2, `big` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is 1, `no` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is not equal to 1 or 2 plus the newly appended value of `a`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `iterable2` is incremented by 1.**
