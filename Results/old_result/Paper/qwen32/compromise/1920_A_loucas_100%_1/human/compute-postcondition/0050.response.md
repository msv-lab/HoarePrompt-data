The only variable in the loop head is `iterable`, so we can only adjust that one. The loop will execute as long as `iterable` is less than `loop`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `iterable` would have taken on a value from `0` to `loop-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `iterable` needs to be incremented by 1, provided it remains less than `loop`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should have `iterable` incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `less` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 2, `big` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 1, `no` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1` minus the count of elements in `no` that are between `max(big)` and `min(less)` inclusive, and `innerLoop` is the length of the list `no`, `iterable` is incremented by 1**
