Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `less` contains all `a` where `x` was 2, `big` contains all `a` where `x` was 1, `no` contains at least one element, `iterable` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `x` was not 1, and `innerLoop` remains unchanged. If `i` is between `max(big)` and `min(less)` inclusive, `num` is set to `min(less) - max(big)`. Otherwise, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`. `i` is the next element in `no` after the current `i` from the previous iteration.**
