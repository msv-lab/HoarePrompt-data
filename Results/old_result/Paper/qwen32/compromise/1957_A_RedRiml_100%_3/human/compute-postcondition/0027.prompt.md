Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w`, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w`, where `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers from the input that has at least 1 integer; `d` is a dictionary where if `d.get(i)` was `None`, `d` now has the key `i` with the value `1`. Otherwise, `d[i]` is the previous value of `d[i]` plus 1. If `i` was not in `pl`, `pl` now contains the integer `i`. If `i` was already in `pl`, `pl` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w`, where `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers from the input that has at least 1 integer; `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is `1` if `i` was not previously a key in `d`, or `d[i]` is incremented by 1 if `i` was already a key in `d`; `pl` includes the integer `i` if it was not already in `pl`; `i` is the next element in `palka`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w`, where `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers from the input that has at least 1 integer; `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is either 1 (if `i` was not previously a key in `d`) or incremented by 1 (if `i` was already a key in `d`); `pl` includes the integer `i` if it was not already in `pl`, and if `i` was not in `pl`, `pl` now includes the next element `i` from `palka`; `i` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
