The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the elements of the list `palka`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to reflect the next element in `palka`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has taken on the value of the current element in `palka`.
2. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` should take on the value of the next element in `palka`.

Given that `palka` is a list of integers with at least one element, and we've just finished an iteration with the current `i`, the next value of `i` should be the next element in `palka`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

State: **`t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w - 1`, where `w` is greater than 1; `ln` is the new input integer; `palka` is a new list of integers from the input and must have at least 1 element; `pl` is a list that may or may not contain the value `i` (if `i` was not in `pl` before, it is now added); `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`. If `d.get(i)` was `None`, then `d` is updated to contain the key `i` with the value `1`. Otherwise, if `d.get(i)` is not `None`, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by `1`. `i` is the next element in `palka`**.
