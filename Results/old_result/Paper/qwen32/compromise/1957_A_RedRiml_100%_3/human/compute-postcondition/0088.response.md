The code snippet `d[i] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. This means that the dictionary `d` will now have a key `i` with a value of `1`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is `w - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with `d[i] = 1`**
