Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w`, where `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers from the input that has at least 1 integer; `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is `1` if `i` was not previously a key in `d`, or `d[i]` is incremented by 1 if `i` was already a key in `d`; `pl` is unchanged if `i` was already in `pl`, or now contains the integer `i` if `i` was not in `pl`; `i` is the next element in `palka`; `pl` now includes the integer `i` at the end of the list.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains the input integer `w` which is greater than 0; `ln` remains the input integer; `palka` remains the list of integers from the input; `d` remains the dictionary where each key's value is incremented or set to 1 based on previous occurrences; `pl` now includes the integer `i` at the end of the list; and `i` remains the next element in `palka`.
