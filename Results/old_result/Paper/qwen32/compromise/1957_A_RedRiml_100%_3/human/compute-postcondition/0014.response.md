Postcondition: **`t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w`, where `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers from the input that has at least 1 integer; `d` is a dictionary where if `d.get(i)` was `None`, `d` now has the key `i` with the value `1`. Otherwise, `d[i]` is the previous value of `d[i]` plus 1. If `i` was not in `pl`, `pl` now contains the integer `i`. If `i` was already in `pl`, `pl` remains unchanged.**
