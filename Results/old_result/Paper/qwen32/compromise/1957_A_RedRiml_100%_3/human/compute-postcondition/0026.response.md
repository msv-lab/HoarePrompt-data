Postcondition: **`t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w`, where `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers from the input that has at least 1 integer; `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is either 1 (if `i` was not previously a key in `d`) or incremented by 1 (if `i` was already a key in `d`); `pl` includes the integer `i` if it was not already in `pl`, and if `i` was not in `pl`, `pl` now includes the next element `i` from `palka`; `i` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`.**
