Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w`, where `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers from the input; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and the corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `palka`; `pl` is a list that contains each unique integer from `palka` in the order they first appear.**

In simple terms, after the loop has finished executing, `t` retains its initial value, `ln` remains unchanged, `palka` is still the input list, `d` contains the count of how many times each integer appears in `palka`, and `pl` is a list of unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared.
