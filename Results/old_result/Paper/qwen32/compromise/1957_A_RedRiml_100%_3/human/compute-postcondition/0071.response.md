The value of `shapes` is incremented by the integer division of `d[j]` by 3. Since `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, the result of `d[j] // 3` is a non-negative integer. The values of `t`, `pl`, and `d[j]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `shapes` is `shapes` + `d[j] // 3`, `pl` is a non-empty iterable, and `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.**
