The code snippet `d[i] = 1` sets the value of `d[i]` to 1. This affects the variable `d` by updating the value at index `i` to 1. The other variables (`t`, `shapes`, `w`, `ln`, `palka`, and `i`) remain unchanged, except for the condition that `d` is now explicitly set at index `i` to 1.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is `w - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `d` is unchanged except `d[i]` is set to 1, `i` is the next element in `palka`.**
