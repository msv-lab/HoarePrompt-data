The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `w`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used for iteration and does not affect the loop's continuation, the only state that needs adjustment is `w`.

Given that the loop will execute `w` times, at the start of each iteration, `w` should be decremented by 1 (since the loop will have executed one more time).

State: **`t` is unchanged; `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3; `w` is decremented by 1**.

To be more precise, if `w` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `w` should be `k-1`.

State: **`t` is unchanged; `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3; `w` is `w - 1`**.
