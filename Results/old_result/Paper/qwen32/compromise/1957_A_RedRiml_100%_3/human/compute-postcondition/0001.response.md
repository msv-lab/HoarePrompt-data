The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the variable `w`. The loop will execute based on the value of `w`. If `w` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `t` is assigned the value of `w`, but `t` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `w` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` does not need to be adjusted as it is a throwaway variable used to iterate `w` times.

State: **`t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w`, `w` must be greater than 0**
