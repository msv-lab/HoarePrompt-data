Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is unchanged; `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3; `w` is `w - 1`; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `pl` is an empty list; `d` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is unchanged, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is `w - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, and `d` is a dictionary. If `i` was not in `pl` initially, `pl` now contains the element `i`, and the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1 (or set to 1 if it was initially `None`). If `i` was already in `pl`, `pl` remains unchanged, and `d[i]` is incremented by 1 (or set to 1 if it was initially `None`).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is unchanged, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is `w - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `d` is unchanged except `d[i]` is set to 1 if `d.get(i)` is `None`, or incremented by 1 otherwise, `i` is the next element in `palka`. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `i` is appended to `pl`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is unchanged, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is `w - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `d` is unchanged except `d[i]` is set to 1 if `d.get(i)` was `None`, or incremented by 1 otherwise, `i` is the next element in `palka`, and if `i` was not in `pl`, then `pl` now includes `i` as its last element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
