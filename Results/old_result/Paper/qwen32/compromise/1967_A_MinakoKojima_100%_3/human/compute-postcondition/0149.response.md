Postcondition: **`ans_list` contains the previous values of `ans` plus the new value of `ans`; `ans` is updated to `a[0]`; `res` is `n - 1` since `dif` is not 0; `k` is 0 if exhausted; `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2; `k` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input; `i` is 0; `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]` and `dif` is not 0; `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`**
