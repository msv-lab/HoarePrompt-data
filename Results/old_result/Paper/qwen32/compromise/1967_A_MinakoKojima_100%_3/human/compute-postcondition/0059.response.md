Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`, `i` is 2. If `k` is 0, then `k`, `ans`, and `res` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the behavior is as described in the precondition: if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is increased by `dif`, and `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `k` is set to 0, `ans` is increased by `k // 3`, and `res` remains unchanged.**
