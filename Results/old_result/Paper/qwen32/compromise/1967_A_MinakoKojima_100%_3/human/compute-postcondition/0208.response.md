The only variable in the loop head is `a`, which is the loop variable iterating over `ans_list`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `ans_list`. If there are more elements in `ans_list` beyond the current element `a`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` is the first element in `ans_list`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ans_list` must have at least two elements, and `a` should be the second element in the list.

State: **`ans_list` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in `ans_list`**
