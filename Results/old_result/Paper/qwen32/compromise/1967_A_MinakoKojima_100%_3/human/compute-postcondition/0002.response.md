The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state only specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, which is not affected by the code. Therefore, the output state includes the new variables `n` and `k` with the values provided by the input, and the precondition on `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input.**
