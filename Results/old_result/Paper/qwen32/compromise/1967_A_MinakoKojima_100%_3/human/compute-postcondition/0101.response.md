Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a newly input list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans_list` contains the previous value of `ans` appended to it, `i` is `i + 1`, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1; `ans` is `ans + dif`.**

Natural language: The value of `ans` is now the sum of its previous value and `dif`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
