The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given that the loop iterates over `range(n - 1)`, the loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration. We need to adjust `i` accordingly to reflect the start of the next iteration. The variable `n` remains constant throughout the loop.

From the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `ans_list` contains the previous values of `ans` plus the new value of `ans`.
- `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`.
- `k` is 0 if `dif` is not 0.
- `ans` and `res` are updated based on the conditions provided.
- `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input.
- `i` is either 0 or not 0.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` has some value, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

State: **`ans_list` contains the previous values of `ans` plus the new value of `ans`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `k` is 0 if `dif` is not 0, `ans` and `res` are updated based on the conditions provided**.

Since we are only concerned with the variables in the loop head, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2**.
