Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a newly input list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans_list` contains the previous value of `ans` appended to it, `i` is `i + 1`, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1, `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`, `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`**

In natural language: The value of `res` is increased by the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `ans_list`, `i`, `dif`, and `ans`) retain their previous values or conditions.
