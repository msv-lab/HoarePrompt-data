The code snippet `ans += k // (i + 1)` modifies the variable `ans` by adding the result of the integer division of `k` by `i + 1` to it. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `dif`, and `res`) are not directly affected by this line of code.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 before the provided code snippet, `i + 1` is the current value of `i` plus one. Therefore, `ans` is updated to its current value plus the integer division of `k` by this new value of `i + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans + k // (i + 1)`**.
