The value of `res` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `dif`, `ans`, `k`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `ans` is `ans + dif`, `k` is `k - dif * (i + 1)`, `res` is decremented by 1**.
