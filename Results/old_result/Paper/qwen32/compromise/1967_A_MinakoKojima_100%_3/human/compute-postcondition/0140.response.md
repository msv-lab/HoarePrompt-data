The code snippet provided sorts the list `a`. The values of `ans_list`, `ans`, `res`, `k`, `n`, and the initial state of `a` remain unchanged except for `a` itself, which is now sorted.

Output State: **`ans_list` contains the previous values of `ans` plus the new value of `ans`, `ans` is updated to `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`, `res` is the remaining iterations not completed minus 1, and `k` is 0 if exhausted; `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input.**
