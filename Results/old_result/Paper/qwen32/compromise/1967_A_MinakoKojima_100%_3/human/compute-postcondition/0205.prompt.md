Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Each test case consists of two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and k (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12), representing the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins, respectively. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12), where a_i represents the number of cards of type i initially available. The number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) is provided at the beginning, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5. `ans_list` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    ans = a[0]
    res = n - 1
    for i in range(n - 1):
        dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
        if dif == 0:
            res -= 1
        if dif != 0:
            if k >= dif * (i + 1):
                ans += dif
                k -= dif * (i + 1)
                res -= 1
            else:
                ans += k // (i + 1)
                if i != 0:
                    res += k % (i + 1)
                k = 0
                break
            if k == 0:
                break
    if k != 0:
        ans += k // n
        res += k % n
    ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)
    ans += res
    ans_list.append(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are as per the input, `a` is the same sorted list, `ans` is updated to its previous value plus `res`, `res` is `n - 1` minus the number of non-zero and zero differences plus `k % n` if `k` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ans` and `res` remain unchanged, `ans_list` contains the previous value of `ans` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans_list` contains the previous values of `ans` plus the new value of `ans`, `ans` is updated to `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`, `res` is the remaining iterations not completed (or 0 if all completed), and `k` is 0 if exhausted.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans_list` contains all previous values of `ans` plus the final value of `ans` and the newly appended value of `ans`; `ans` is updated to `ans + res + (ans - 1) * (n - 1)`; `k` is 0 or not 0; `n` is unchanged; `a` is unchanged; `res` is unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
