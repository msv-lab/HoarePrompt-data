The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the index that was just processed, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a newly input list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans_list` contains the previous value of `ans` appended to it, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration.**

Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted, we increment `i` by 1 to prepare for the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a newly input list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans_list` contains the previous value of `ans` appended to it, `i` is `i + 1`**
