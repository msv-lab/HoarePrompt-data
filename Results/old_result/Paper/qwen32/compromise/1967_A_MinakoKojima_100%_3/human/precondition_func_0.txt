Each test case consists of two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and k (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12), representing the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins, respectively. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12), where a_i represents the number of cards of type i initially available. The number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) is provided at the beginning, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.
