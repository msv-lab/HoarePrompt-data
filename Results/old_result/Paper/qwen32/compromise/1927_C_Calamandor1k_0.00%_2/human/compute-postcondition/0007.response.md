Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `b` is a list of integers read from input; `len_a` is the length of list `a`; `len_b` is the length of list `b`; `count_a` is 0; `count_b` is 0; `d` is `k // 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `d` is assigned the value of `k` integer divided by 2. All other variables retain their initial values.
