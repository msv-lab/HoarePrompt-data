Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` such that `t` >= 0; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from input; `a` is a new list of integers read from input; `b` is a new list of integers read from input; `len_a` must be at least 1 or `len_b` must be at least 1; `d` is `k // 2`; `i` is `i + 1` such that `i` < `max(len_a, len_b)`; `count_a` is incremented by 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `count_a` has been increased by 1. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
