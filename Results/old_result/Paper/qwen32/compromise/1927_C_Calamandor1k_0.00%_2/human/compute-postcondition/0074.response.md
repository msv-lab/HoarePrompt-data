The code snippet resets the values of `count_a` and `count_b` to 0. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t + 1` such that `t` > 0; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from input; `a` is a new list of integers read from input; `b` is a new list of integers read from input; `len_a` is the length of the list `a`; `len_b` is the length of the list `b`; `d` is `k // 2`; `count_a` is 0; `count_b` is 0.**
