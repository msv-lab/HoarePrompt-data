The code snippet `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The variable `t` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from input**.
