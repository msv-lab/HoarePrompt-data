Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `b` is a list of integers read from input; `len_a` is the length of list `a`; `len_b` is the length of list `b`.**

Explanation: The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Two new variables, `len_a` and `len_b`, are introduced, representing the lengths of lists `a` and `b`, respectively.
