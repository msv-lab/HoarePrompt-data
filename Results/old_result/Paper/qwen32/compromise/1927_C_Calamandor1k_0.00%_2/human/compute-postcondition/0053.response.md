The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the maximum length between `len_a` and `len_b`. If `i` is less than `max(len_a, len_b)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is such that `t` is `t - 1` and `t` is still >= 0. This means `i` has been incremented by 1 from the previous iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value, and it must still be less than `max(len_a, len_b)`.

State: **`t` is `t - 1` such that `t` >= 0; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from input; `a` is a new list of integers read from input; `b` is a new list of integers read from input; `len_a` must be at least 1 or `len_b` must be at least 1; `d` is `k // 2`; `i` is `i + 1` such that `i` < `max(len_a, len_b)`**
