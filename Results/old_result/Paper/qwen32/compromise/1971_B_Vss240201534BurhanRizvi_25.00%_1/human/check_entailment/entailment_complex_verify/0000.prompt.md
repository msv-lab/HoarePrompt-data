You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
import random

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: A series of "Yes" or "No" printed `t` times, with "Yes" followed by a shuffled version of the input string `s` if `s` is not equal to its shuffled version.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters. It then checks if the string `s` can be rearranged into a different permutation. If it can, the function prints "Yes" followed by one such permutation; otherwise, it prints "No". This process is repeated `t` times.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses a random approach to rearrange the characters of the string `s`. While this might work in many cases, it does not guarantee that a different string `r` will always be produced, especially for strings with repeated characters. There is a possibility that the random rearrangement could result in the same string `s` again, which would make the output incorrect for those cases.

For example, consider the string "aaaaa". No matter how many times you randomly rearrange the characters, you will always get "aaaaa", so the program will incorrectly output "No" for this case.

Another example is the string "xxxyx". While it is possible to rearrange it to "xyxxx" or another permutation, there is no guarantee that the random approach will always produce a different string. It might produce "xxxyx" again, leading to an incorrect output of "No". 

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is therefore incorrect.
