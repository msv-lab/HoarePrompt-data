Correctness: **False**

The provided program has an issue with the logic for updating the `sm` variable, which counts the number of matching elements between the current subsegment of `a` and `b`. Specifically, the condition checks for `ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]` and `ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]` are incorrect. These conditions do not accurately reflect when the count of matching elements should be increased or decreased.

Here's a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    cb = Counter(b)
    ca = Counter(a[:m])
    ans = 0
    sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
    if sm >= k:
        ans += 1
    for r in range(m, n):
        ca[a[r]] += 1
        ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
        if ca[a[r - m]] == 0:
            del ca[a[r - m]]
        sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
        if sm >= k:
            ans += 1
    return ans
```

In this corrected version, after updating the counts for the sliding window, we recalculate `sm` by taking the intersection of `ca` and `cb` again. This ensures that `sm` accurately reflects the number of matching elements in the current window. This change should make the program correct for the given problem.
