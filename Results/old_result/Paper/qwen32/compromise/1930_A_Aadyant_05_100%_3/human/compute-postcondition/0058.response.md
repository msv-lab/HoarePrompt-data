The code appends the integer value of `str` to `list2`. Therefore, `list2` will now include the integer value of `str` as its last element. The other variables remain unchanged in terms of their described states or values.

Output State: **`s` is 0; `n`, `t`, `str` remain unchanged; `final` includes the value of `s` (before it was reset) appended to it; `num` is the previous value of `num` plus 1; `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `str` appended to its previous contents; `a` is the user input string; `list1` is a list of words from the string `b` that must have at least one word; `str` is the next word in `list1`.**
