The provided code snippet is `list1 = []`, which reassigns the variable `list1` to be an empty list. This means the previous value of `list1` (which was a list of substrings obtained by splitting `b` on whitespace) is no longer relevant and is now an empty list.

Here is the output state with the updated value for `list1`, while keeping other variables unchanged:

Output State: **`n` is an input string representing a valid integer that is at least 1, `t` is between 1 and 5000, `final` is a list containing `s`, `s` is 0, `list2` is an empty list, `a` is the new input string provided by the user, `b` is an input string provided by the user that must contain at least one non-whitespace character, `list1` is an empty list, `str` is the last element of `list1` that was processed by the loop, `i` is the last even index that is less than the length of `list2`, `num` is incremented by 1.**
