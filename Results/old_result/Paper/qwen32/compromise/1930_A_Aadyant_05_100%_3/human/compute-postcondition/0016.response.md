The code snippet provided sorts the list `list2`. Given the initial state, `list2` contains the integer values of all elements in `list1`, which is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string `b` on whitespace. After sorting `list2`, the order of the elements in `list2` will be in ascending order based on their integer values. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `final`, `s`, `a`, `b`, `list1`, and `str`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input string representing a valid integer that is at least 1, `t` is between 1 and 5000, `final` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `list2` is a sorted list of integer values obtained from `list1`, `a` is the input string provided by the user, `b` is an input string provided by the user that must contain at least one non-whitespace character, `list1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `b` on whitespace, `str` is the last element of `list1` that was processed by the loop.**
