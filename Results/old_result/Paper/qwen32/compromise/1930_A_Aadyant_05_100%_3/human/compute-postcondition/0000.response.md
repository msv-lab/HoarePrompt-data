Output State: **`n` is an input string representing half the number of integers on the whiteboard. The total number of test cases, `t`, is between 1 and 5000, and the sequence of integers on the whiteboard remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of the input, which is a string. The initial conditions about the total number of test cases and the sequence of integers on the whiteboard remain unchanged as they are not affected by this single line of code.
