Output State: **`n` is an input string representing a valid integer that is at least 1, `t` is between 1 and 5000, `final` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `str`, `a` is the input string provided by the user, `b` is an input string provided by the user that must contain at least one non-whitespace character, `list1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `b` on whitespace and must have at least one element, `str` is the first element of `list1`**

Explanation: The code appends the integer value of `str` to `list2`. Therefore, `list2` now contains this integer value. All other variables remain unchanged.
