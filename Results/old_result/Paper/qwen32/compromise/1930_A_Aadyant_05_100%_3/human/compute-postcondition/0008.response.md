The code snippet provided splits the string `b` into a list of substrings based on whitespace and assigns this list to `list1`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, after executing the code, the output state will be:

Output State: **`n` is an input string representing a valid integer that is at least 1, `t` is between 1 and 5000, `final` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `list2` is an empty list, `a` is the input string provided by the user, `list1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `b` on whitespace, `b` is an input string provided by the user.**
