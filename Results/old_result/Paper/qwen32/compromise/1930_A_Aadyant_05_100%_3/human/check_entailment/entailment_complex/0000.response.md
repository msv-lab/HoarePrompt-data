Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to solve the problem by processing multiple test cases. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. The program sorts the list of integers and then sums up the integers at even indices, which corresponds to the minimum of each pair when the list is sorted. This approach ensures that the minimum of each pair is always added to the score, thereby maximizing the final score as required by the problem statement.

However, there is a mistake in the code. The program reads the input in a way that it expects three separate inputs for each test case (`n`, `a`, and `b`), but according to the problem description, there are only two inputs per test case: `n` and the list of `2n` integers. The variable `a` is read but not used, and `b` contains the list of integers. This discrepancy does not affect the logic of the program as long as the input is provided in the correct format (i.e., `n` followed by the list of integers on the next line), but it is unnecessary and could lead to confusion or errors if the input format is not strictly adhered to.

The logic of summing the integers at even indices after sorting the list is correct and aligns with the optimal strategy to maximize the score.

Correctness: **True**  
(Note: Although the code could be simplified by removing the unused variable `a`, the logic itself is correct given the input is provided as described in the problem statement.)
