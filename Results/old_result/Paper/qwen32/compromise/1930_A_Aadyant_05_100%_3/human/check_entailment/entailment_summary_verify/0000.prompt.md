You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        list2 = []
        a = input()
        list1 = []
        b = input()
        list1 = b.split()
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        list2.sort()
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. It calculates the sum of the integers at even indices after sorting the list for each test case and prints these sums.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in how it handles input. Specifically, it reads the number of test cases `t`, but then it reads inputs in a way that assumes each test case has two lines of input: one for `n` and one for the list of numbers. However, the problem description specifies that the first line of each test case contains `n`, and the second line contains `2n` integers. The current program incorrectly reads an extra line for each test case, which will cause it to fail on the actual input format.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
- The program reads `n` correctly as the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `a` (which should be `n`), then reads `b` (which should be the list of `2n` integers).
- It then reads another line `b` which is not expected according to the problem description, causing a mismatch in input handling.

To fix this, the program should be adjusted to correctly read the inputs as specified in the problem description. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    final = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list1.sort()
        s = sum(list1[i] for i in range(0, 2*n, 2))
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `2n` integers, sorts the list, and sums every second element starting from the first, appending the result to the final scores list. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.
