You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        list2 = []
        a = input()
        list1 = []
        b = input()
        list1 = b.split()
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        list2.sort()
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), representing half the number of integers on the whiteboard. This is followed by a line containing 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), which are the numbers written on the whiteboard. The total number of test cases, t, is between 1 and 5000.

        final.append(s)
        
    #State: `final` is a list containing `int(n)` sums, each sum being the sum of integers at even indices of the respective `list2` generated in each iteration.

    #State: All elements of the `final` list have been printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and then reads the `2n` integers on the whiteboard.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes a score `s` to 0.
   - It reads the `2n` integers, converts them to a list `list2`, and sorts this list.
   - It then iterates through the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the first element of each pair to the score `s`. This is because, in a sorted list, the smallest elements will be at the beginning, and by pairing them up, we ensure that we are always adding the smaller of the two numbers in each pair to the score.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the score for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the input in a way that does not match the problem description. Specifically, it reads `n` and then expects two separate lines of input for `a` and `b`, which is incorrect. According to the problem, `n` is followed by a single line of `2n` integers.

2. **Incorrect Loop for Reading Test Cases:**
   - The loop that processes each test case runs `int(n)` times, where `n` is the number of test cases. This is incorrect. It should run `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

3. **Unnecessary Conversion:**
   - The program converts `b` to a list of integers, but `b` is not defined properly. Instead, it should read the line of integers after reading `n`.

### Corrected Program:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
    final = []
    for _ in range(t):  # Loop over each test case
        n = int(input())  # Read the number of pairs
        a = input().split()  # Read the 2n integers as a list of strings
        list2 = [int(x) for x in a]  # Convert the list of strings to a list of integers
        list2.sort()  # Sort the list
        s = 0
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):  # Iterate through the list in steps of 2
            s += list2[i]  # Add the smaller element of each pair to the score
        final.append(s)  # Store the score for this test case
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)  # Print the scores for all test cases

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect due to improper handling of input and logic for reading test cases. The corrected version provided above should work as expected.

Correctness: **False**
