The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the length of `inpstr`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `inpstr` has a length that allows the loop to execute. The variable `i` is the loop counter and will be initialized to 0 before the first iteration of the loop, so we don't need to adjust its state explicitly.

To ensure the loop executes, `inpstr` must have at least one character, making `len(inpstr)` greater than 0.

State: **`inpstr` is a string containing the first line of the input, which is the integer `t` representing the number of test cases and must have at least one character; `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr` or 0 if 'B' is not present; `ind2` is 0; `outind` is 0**
