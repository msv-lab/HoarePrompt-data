You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program: 
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the length of the strip, followed by a string s of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'W' denotes a white cell and 'B' denotes a black cell. It is guaranteed that at least one cell in the strip is black.
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
        
    #State: `inpstr` is a string containing the first line of the input, which is the integer `t` representing the number of test cases; `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr` or 0 if 'B' is not present; `ind2` is 0; `outind` is 0.
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
        
    #State: `inpstr` is a string containing the first line of the input, which is the integer `t` representing the number of test cases; `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr` or 0 if 'B' is not present; `ind2` is the index of the last 'B' in `inpstr` from the end or 0 if 'B' is not present; `outind` is 0.
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
    #This is printed: length of `inpstr` (where `inpstr` is the string representation of the integer `t`)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B'. It then calculates and prints the length of the string `s` minus the sum of the index of the first 'B' from the start and the index of the last 'B' from the end. However, the provided annotations and comments do not accurately describe the intended functionality, as the function seems to be incorrectly processing the input and does not handle multiple test cases as described.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. The program calculates the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white by finding the first and last black cells and then computing the length of the segment between them. However, this approach does not guarantee that the entire strip will be painted white, as there might be other black cells within the identified segment that are not adjacent to the first or last black cells.

For example, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5
BBWBW
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

In this example, the program identifies the first black cell at index 0 and the last black cell at index 3. It then calculates the length of the segment as `5 - 3 - 0 = 2`, which is incorrect. The correct minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to make the entire strip white is 5, as the segment must include all black cells.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not handle cases where black cells are not adjacent to the first or last black cells in the strip.
