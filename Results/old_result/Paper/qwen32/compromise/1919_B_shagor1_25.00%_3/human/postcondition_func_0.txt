For each test case, the function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-' characters. It then calculates and prints a value based on the number of '-' characters in the string. Specifically, it prints `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg` (where `neg` is the count of '-' characters), otherwise it prints `n`.
