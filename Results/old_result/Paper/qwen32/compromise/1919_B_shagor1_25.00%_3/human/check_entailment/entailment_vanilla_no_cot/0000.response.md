Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty based on the problem description. The program simply calculates a value based on the number of '-' characters in the string, which does not account for the optimal way to split the array into subarrays to minimize the total penalty. The correct solution requires a more complex algorithm to determine the optimal splits.
