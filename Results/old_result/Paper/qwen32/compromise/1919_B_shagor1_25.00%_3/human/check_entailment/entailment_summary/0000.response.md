Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The program calculates the number of '-' characters in the string and uses this count to determine the output, which does not align with the described process of splitting the array into subarrays to minimize the total penalty.

The correct approach involves finding an optimal way to split the array `a` such that the sum of penalties of the resulting subarrays is minimized. The penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The program should consider all possible ways to split the array and calculate the total penalty for each, then choose the split that results in the minimum total penalty.

The provided program simply computes `n - 2 * neg` or `n` based on the count of '-' characters, which does not account for the need to split the array optimally to minimize the penalty.

Correctness: **False**
