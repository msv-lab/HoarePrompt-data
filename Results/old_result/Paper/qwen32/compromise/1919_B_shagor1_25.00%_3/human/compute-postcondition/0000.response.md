Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000) representing the length of the string `s`. The second line contains a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-'. The number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 1000, inclusive. There are no constraints on the sum of `n` over all test cases. `n` is assigned the value of the first integer input for the current test case.**

Natural Language: The value of `n` is now the first integer input read for the current test case. All other conditions and variables remain as described in the initial state.
