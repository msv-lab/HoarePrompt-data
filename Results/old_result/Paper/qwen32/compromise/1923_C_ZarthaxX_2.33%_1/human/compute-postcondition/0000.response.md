The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `q`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and for each test case, `n` and `q` are integers within the range 1 to 3 · 10^5. The list `c` and the queries with `l_i` and `r_i` are not affected by this snippet.

After executing the code, `n` and `q` will hold the values read from the input, while `t`, `c`, and the queries remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9; there are `q` queries, and for each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`.**
