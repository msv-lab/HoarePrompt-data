To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to carefully analyze whether it correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the problem description.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program and the problem requirements:

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Sum Condition**: The sum of the subarray \( c_{l_i}, c_{l_i+1}, \dots, c_{r_i} \) should be equal to the sum of another array \( b \) of the same length.
2. **Non-equality Condition**: Each element \( a_i \) of the subarray should not be equal to the corresponding element \( b_i \) of the array \( b \).
3. **Positive Condition**: Each element \( b_i \) of the array \( b \) should be greater than 0.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes two arrays: `ones` and `sum`.
   - `ones[i]` keeps track of the number of 1s up to index `i-1` in the `nums` array.
   - `sum[i]` keeps track of the sum of the subarray `c[1..i]` minus `i`, where `c` is the input array.

2. **Processing Queries**:
   - For each query, the program calculates the number of 1s in the subarray `c[l..r]` using `ones[r] - ones[l-1]`.
   - It also calculates the sum of the subarray `c[l..r]` minus the number of elements in the subarray using `sum[r] - sum[l-1]`.
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is checked to determine if the subarray is "good".

### Correctness Check:
- **Sum Condition**: The program does not explicitly check if there exists an array \( b \) such that the sum of \( b \) equals the sum of the subarray. Instead, it uses a derived condition based on the number of 1s and the sum of the subarray.
- **Non-equality Condition**: The program does not ensure that each element of the subarray is different from the corresponding element of \( b \).
- **Positive Condition**: The program implicitly assumes that \( b \) can be constructed with positive elements by adjusting the sum condition.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic is not sufficient to guarantee that all conditions for a subarray to be "good" are met. Specifically, the condition used to determine if a subarray is "good" does not directly ensure that there exists an array \( b \) that satisfies all the conditions.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
