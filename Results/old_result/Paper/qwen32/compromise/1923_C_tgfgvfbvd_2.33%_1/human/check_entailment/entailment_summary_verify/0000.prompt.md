You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = []
        c = 0
        for x in l:
            c += x
            p.append(c)
        for _ in range(m):
            (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
            s = p[b - 1]
            if a - 2 >= 0:
                s -= p[a - 2]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines if the sum of a specified subarray is at least twice the length of that subarray, printing 'YES' if true and 'NO' otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether a subarray is "good" according to the problem description. Specifically, the condition `if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):` is not sufficient to ensure that there exists an integer array `b` such that the sum of `a_i` equals the sum of `b_i`, `a_i ≠ b_i` for every index `i`, and `b_i > 0` for every index `i`.

Let's analyze why this condition is insufficient:

1. **Sum Condition**: The condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` ensures that the sum of the subarray is large enough to potentially split into two equal parts, but it does not guarantee that we can construct the array `b` with all positive elements different from `a`.

2. **Different Elements Condition**: The program does not check if it is possible to construct an array `b` where `b_i ≠ a_i` for all `i`. The current condition only checks the sum, not the individual elements.

3. **Positive Elements Condition**: While the original array `c` consists of positive integers, the program does not ensure that the constructed array `b` also consists of positive integers and is different from `a`.

To illustrate, consider the following counterexample:

Input:
```
1
3 1
1 1 1
1 3
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

Explanation:
- The subarray is `[1, 1, 1]`.
- The sum is `3`.
- We cannot construct an array `b` of length `3` such that `b_i > 0`, `b_i ≠ a_i` for all `i`, and the sum of `b` is also `3`.

However, the program would incorrectly output `YES` because `3 >= 2 * 3` is false, but the main issue is that the program does not correctly handle the construction of array `b` with the required properties.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
