The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `l`. This means the previous list stored in `l` is overwritten by the new list of integers read from the input.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `n` remains the first integer read from the input.
- `m` remains the second integer read from the input.
- `l` is now a new list of integers read from the input.
- `p` is no longer valid because it was dependent on the previous `l` which has been overwritten.
- `c` is no longer valid because it was dependent on the previous `l` which has been overwritten.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is a new list of integers read from the input, `p` is no longer valid, `c` is no longer valid.**
