The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'YES'` to the console. There are no variables or conditions affecting the output of this statement based on the initial state provided. The initial state describes various variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, `s`) and their relationships, but none of these variables influence the execution of the `print('YES')` statement.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
