The given Python code snippet contains only one line:

```python
print('YES')
```

This line directly prints the string `'YES'`. The initial state and the calculations described do not affect the content of this print statement. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, and `s` are all defined and have certain conditions applied to them, but none of these influence the output of the `print('YES')` statement.

Therefore, the output of the code will be:

Output: **YES**
