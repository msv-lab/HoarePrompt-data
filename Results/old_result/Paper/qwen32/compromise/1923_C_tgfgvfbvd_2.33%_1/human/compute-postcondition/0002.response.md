The code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `l`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **The input function returns `t`, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer read from the input; `m` is the second integer read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the next line of input.**
