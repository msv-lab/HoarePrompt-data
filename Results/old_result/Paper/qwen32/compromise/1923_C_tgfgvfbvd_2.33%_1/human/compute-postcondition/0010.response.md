The code appends the value of `c` to the list `p`. Given that `c` is initially set to `n`, after the operation, `p` will contain two elements: the integer `0` (which was originally in `p`) and the integer `n` (which is now appended to `p`). The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `p` is a list containing the integers 0 and `n`, `c` is `n`.**
