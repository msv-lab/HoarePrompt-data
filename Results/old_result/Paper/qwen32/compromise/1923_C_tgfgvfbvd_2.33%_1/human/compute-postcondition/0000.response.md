In the given task, the for loop iterates based on the value of `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head contains the variable `_` and the function `int(input())`. To ensure that the loop executes, we need to focus on adjusting the state related to `t`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains `_` (which is a common Python convention for a throwaway variable) and `int(input())`. The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a positive integer.

2. **Adjusting the State**: Since `t` is already described as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we need to ensure that the input function returns this value of `t`. This means that before the loop starts, the input should be set up to return `t`.

3. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`n`, `q`, `c`, `l_i`, `r_i`) are mentioned as part of the problem description but are not directly involved in the loop head. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this understanding, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted such that the input function returns the value of `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and the input function returns `t`**.

Since the task specifies that we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and the loop head involves the input function returning `t`, the state adjustment is focused on ensuring that the input function provides the correct value for `t`.

Final State: **The input function returns `t`, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**.
