The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `m` times. Since `_` does not affect the loop's execution condition, we only need to adjust `m` to reflect the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `m` was decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be decremented by 1 again at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input minus 2, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`; otherwise, `s` is `p[b - 1]`. The condition `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` holds true if the if-statement condition is satisfied. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s < 2 * (b - a + 1)` holds true.**
