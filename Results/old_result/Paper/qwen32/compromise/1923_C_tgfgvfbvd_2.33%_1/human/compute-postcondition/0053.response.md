The code appends the value of `c` to the list `p`. Given that `c` is `x`, the list `p` will now contain two elements: the initial `0` and the value of `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `p` is a list containing the integers `[0, x]`, `c` is `x`, `x` is the next element in `l`.**
