To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for _ in range(m):
```

The only variable in the loop head is `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `m` is set to a value greater than 0.

Here are the other variables mentioned in the state before the loop starts: `t`, `n`, `l`, `p`, and `c`. However, since they are not part of the loop head, their values do not directly affect whether the loop will execute or not.

Given this information, the adjusted state should ensure that `m` is greater than 0. The other variables can remain as they are described.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`**
