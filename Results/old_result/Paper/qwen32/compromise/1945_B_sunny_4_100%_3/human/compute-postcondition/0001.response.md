The code snippet provided only reads the integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. No other variables are affected, and no calculations or outputs are performed in this snippet. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of the input value to `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each of the following t lines contains three integers a, b, and m such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18.**
