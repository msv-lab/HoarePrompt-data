Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The current program simply adds the number of fireworks that can be seen from each installation independently and then adds 2, which is not the correct approach.

To solve the problem, we need to consider the overlap of the visibility periods of fireworks launched by both installations. The correct approach involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine when the fireworks from both installations coincide and then calculate the overlap based on the visibility duration `m`.

Here is the correct approach:

1. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
2. Calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period `m`.
3. Calculate the number of fireworks launched by both installations within the visibility period `m` using the LCM.
4. The result is the sum of fireworks from both installations minus the overcounted fireworks that are launched at the same time.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import math

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // math.gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        A = m // a + 1
        B = m // b + 1
        LCM = lcm(a, b)
        AB = m // LCM + 1
        ans = A + B - AB
        print(ans)

func()
```

This code correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time by accounting for the overlap of the visibility periods.
