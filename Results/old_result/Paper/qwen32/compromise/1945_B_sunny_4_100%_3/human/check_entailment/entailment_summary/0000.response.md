### Reasoning:
The provided program calculates the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time using the formula `m // a + m // b + 2`. However, this formula is incorrect based on the problem description.

The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` does not correctly account for the overlap of fireworks' visibility periods. Specifically, it does not consider the exact times when fireworks from both installations are visible at the same time and how their visibility periods might overlap.

The correct approach involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, and then determining how many fireworks from each installation are visible at any given time, considering their visibility periods. The maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously can be found by checking the visibility at multiples of the LCM.

The given program does not implement this logic and instead uses a simpler formula that does not handle the overlaps correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
