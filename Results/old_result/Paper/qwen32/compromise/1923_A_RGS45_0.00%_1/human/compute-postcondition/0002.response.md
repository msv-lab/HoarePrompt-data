To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, let's analyze the given code:

1. The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - `n` is the number of integers in the list.
   - `arr` is the input string of `n` integers (each being either 0 or 1).
   - `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the string `arr`.
   - `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr`, which corresponds to the last occurrence of '1' in the original string `arr`.
   - `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from the first '1' up to the last '1' (inclusive).
   - The code then prints the count of '0's in the substring `z`.

The output of each iteration is the count of '0's between the first and last '1' in the list of integers for that test case.

Since the loop runs `t` times, the output will be a series of `t` integers, each representing the count of '0's between the first and last '1' for each respective test case.

Given the constraints, the values of `t`, `n`, and the list of integers will change with each iteration, but the structure of the output will be `t` integers.

**Output State:** **A series of `t` integers, where each integer represents the count of '0's between the first and last '1' in the list of integers for each test case.**
