You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = str(input(''))
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string of `n` characters (each being either '0' or '1') with at least one '1'. It then calculates and prints the number of '0's between the first and last occurrence of '1' in the string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block. Let's analyze the provided code and the problem description to identify the issues.

#### Provided Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = str(input(''))
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))
```

#### Issues:
1. **Input Parsing**: The input array `arr` is read as a string and not as a list of integers. This can cause issues when trying to manipulate or count elements.
2. **Finding the Range**: The variables `x` and `y` are used to find the first and last positions of the chips ('1'). However, the calculation `z = arr[x:n - y]` is incorrect. It does not correctly identify the range of cells between the first and last chip.
3. **Counting Operations**: The code counts the number of zeros between the first and last chip, but it does not account for the actual movement of chips. The number of operations required is the sum of the distances each chip needs to move to form a contiguous block.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Identify the positions of all chips.
2. Calculate the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a contiguous block.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        chip_positions = [i for i in range(n) if arr[i] == 1]
        median_position = chip_positions[len(chip_positions) // 2]
        operations = sum(abs(pos - median_position) for pos in chip_positions)
        print(operations)

# Example usage
# func()
```

#### Explanation of the Correct Program:
1. **Input Parsing**: The input array `arr` is parsed as a list of integers.
2. **Chip Positions**: We collect the positions of all chips in the `chip_positions` list.
3. **Median Position**: The median position is chosen as the target position for the block of chips. This minimizes the total number of moves.
4. **Counting Operations**: The number of operations is calculated as the sum of the distances from each chip to the median position.

This corrected program should handle all edge cases and provide the correct minimum number of operations for each test case.
