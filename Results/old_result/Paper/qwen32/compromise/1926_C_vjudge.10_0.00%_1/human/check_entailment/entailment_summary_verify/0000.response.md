### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary.

1. **Incorrect Loop Range**:
   - The problem states that Vladislav wrote integers from 1 to n, inclusive. However, the inner loop `for i in range(n):` starts from 0 and goes up to `n-1`. This is incorrect because it includes 0, which should not be part of the sum, and excludes `n`, which should be included. The correct range should be `for i in range(1, n + 1):`.

2. **Global `soma` Variable**:
   - The `soma` variable is used globally to accumulate the sum across all test cases. This is indeed incorrect. The `soma` variable should be local to each test case to ensure the sum is reset for each new test case.

3. **Function Call Order**:
   - The function `func_1(i)` is called before its definition, which will result in a `NameError`. The function `func_1` should be defined before it is used in the loop.

4. **Output for Each Test Case**:
   - The program does not output the result for each test case separately. Instead, it accumulates all sums into a single variable and prints it at the end. The correct behavior is to print the result for each test case after processing it.

### Corrected Version of the Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program based on the above points:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))

def solve():
    N = int(input())
    for _ in range(N):
        n = int(input())
        soma = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            soma += func_1(i)
        print(soma)

solve()
```

### Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate because the provided program has the issues mentioned above. The corrected version addresses these issues and is consistent with the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
