Reasoning:  
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect based on the problem description. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Global Variable Usage**: The variable `soma` is used as a global variable to accumulate the sum of the digits for all test cases. However, the program does not reset `soma` to 0 for each test case, which means the sum from previous test cases will carry over to the next test case. This will result in incorrect sums for each test case after the first one.

2. **Loop Range**: The outer loop `for _ in range(N):` is correct for iterating over the number of test cases. However, the inner loop `for i in range(n):` should start from 1 to `n` inclusive, not from 0 to `n-1`. The range should be `for i in range(1, n+1):` to include the number `n` itself.

3. **Function Call**: The function `func_1(i)` is called correctly to compute the sum of digits of `i`.

4. **Output**: The program does not output the result for each test case separately. Instead, it accumulates the sum for all test cases into `soma` and prints it only once at the end. The correct approach is to print the result for each test case immediately after computing it.

To correct the program, we need to reset `soma` for each test case, adjust the range to start from 1, and print the result after processing each test case.

Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))

N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    soma = 0  # Reset soma for each test case
    for i in range(1, n+1):  # Correct range to include n
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)  # Print result for each test case
```

Correctness: **False**
