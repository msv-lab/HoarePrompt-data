### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and its annotations in the context of the problem description and the original assessment.

1. **Global Variable Usage**:
   - The `soma` variable is indeed used as a global accumulator across all test cases. This means that the sum from previous test cases will carry over to the next test case, leading to incorrect results for subsequent test cases. The original assessment is correct on this point.

2. **Loop Range**:
   - The inner loop `for i in range(n):` iterates from 0 to `n-1`, which means it does not include `n` itself. The problem requires summing the digits of numbers from 1 to `n`, inclusive. The original assessment correctly identifies that the range should be `for i in range(1, n+1)`.

3. **Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1(i)` correctly computes the sum of the digits of `i`. The original assessment acknowledges this as correct.

4. **Output**:
   - The program accumulates the sum for all test cases into `soma` and prints it only once at the end. This is incorrect because the problem requires the sum for each test case to be printed separately. The original assessment correctly identifies this as an issue.

### Evaluation of Annotations:

- **State of the program right before the function call**: The annotations correctly state that `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`.
- **Function `func_1(n)`**: The annotations correctly describe that the function returns the sum of the digits of the integer `n`.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the given program. The program does not reset `soma` for each test case, it iterates over the wrong range, and it does not print the result for each test case separately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
