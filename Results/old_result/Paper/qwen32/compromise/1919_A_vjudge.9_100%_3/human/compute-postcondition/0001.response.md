The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to ensure that the loop can execute. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1, and `i` should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
