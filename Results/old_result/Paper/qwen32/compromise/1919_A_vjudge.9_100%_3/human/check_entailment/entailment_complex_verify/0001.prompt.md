You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. There are t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) such test cases.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: The loop will have printed "Bob" if the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets was even for each test case, and "Alice" if the difference was odd. The variables `a`, `b`, and `i` will have their last iteration values, and `t` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads the number of test cases, `t`, and for each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. It then determines if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd. If the difference is even, it prints "Bob"; if the difference is odd, it prints "Alice". This process is repeated for all `t` test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem and the solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns playing. Each player can choose to exchange wallets or keep their current wallet, and then they must remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a move loses.

### Key Observations

1. **Optimal Play**: Both players play optimally. This means they will make the best possible moves to win.
2. **Turn Order**: Alice goes first.
3. **Winning Condition**: The player who cannot make a move loses.

### Strategy

Given two wallets with `a` and `b` coins, the game can be analyzed based on the difference between `a` and `b`.

- If `a == b`, the first player (Alice) will always lose if both play optimally. This is because no matter what Alice does, Bob can always mirror her moves, leading to a situation where Alice is forced to make the last move and lose.
- If `a != b`, the first player (Alice) can always force a win by making the difference between the wallets odd after her first move. She can achieve this by swapping the wallets if necessary, then removing a coin to make the difference odd. From there, she can always mirror Bob's moves, ensuring that she never faces a situation where both wallets are empty on her turn.

### Conclusion

- If `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`, Alice will lose if both play optimally.
- If `abs(a - b) % 2 != 0`, Alice will win if both play optimally.

### Program Analysis

The provided program correctly implements this logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
- It calculates the absolute difference between the two wallets.
- It checks if the difference is even or odd and prints the winner based on the analysis above.

### Final Answer

The program correctly determines the winner based on the optimal play strategy.
