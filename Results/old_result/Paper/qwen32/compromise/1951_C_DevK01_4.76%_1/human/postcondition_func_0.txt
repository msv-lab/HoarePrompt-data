The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `n` integers representing ticket prices. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost to buy up to `k` tickets, given that `m` is the total amount of money available per ticket purchase and tickets can be bought in batches of up to `m` tickets per day.
