To determine the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and what gets printed as a result. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, the loop reads three integers: `A`, `B`, and `C`.
3. The loop then executes the following logic:
   - If `B * 2 < C`, it prints `A * B`.
   - If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is even, it prints `int(A * C / 2)`.
   - If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is odd, it prints `A // 2` and then `X * C + B` where `X = A // 2`.

The loop does not modify the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b` from the initial state. It only processes the input for each test case and prints the results based on the conditions specified.

After all iterations, the state of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remains unchanged. The only thing that changes is the output printed to the console, which is dependent on the input values for each test case.

Given the format requirement, the output state will describe the unchanged variables and the printed output for each test case. However, since the printed output is not stored in any variable but is printed directly, we can only describe the unchanged variables in the output state.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.**
