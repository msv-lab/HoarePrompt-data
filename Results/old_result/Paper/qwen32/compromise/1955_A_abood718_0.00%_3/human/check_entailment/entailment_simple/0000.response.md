Let's analyze the given program and the problem statement to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts.
2. **Conditions**:
   - The cost for one yogurt is `a` burles.
   - The cost for two yogurts with promotion is `b` burles.
3. **Constraints**:
   - `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4` (number of test cases)
   - `1 ≤ n ≤ 100` (number of yogurts to buy)
   - `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30` (prices of yogurts)

### Program Analysis:
The provided program iterates through each test case and calculates the minimum cost based on the given conditions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   
2. **Logic**:
   - The program checks if buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than buying them with the promotion (`B * 2 < C`). If true, it calculates the cost as `A * B`.
   - If `n` is even, it calculates the cost as `(n // 2) * b` because all yogurts can be bought in pairs.
   - If `n` is odd, it calculates the cost as `(n // 2) * b + a` because one yogurt will be bought individually and the rest in pairs.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Variable Naming**:
   - The variables `A`, `B`, and `C` are used, but they should be `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively for clarity and consistency with the problem statement.
   
2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The condition `if B * 2 < C` is incorrect. It should be `if a * 2 <= b` to determine if buying two yogurts individually is cheaper or equal to the promotion.
   - The print statement `print(X)` in the `else` block is unnecessary and incorrect. It should be removed.
   - The final print statement in the `else` block should be `print(X * b + a)` instead of `print(X * C + B)`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a * 2 <= b:
            print(n * a)
        elif n % 2 == 0:
            print((n // 2) * b)
        else:
            X = n // 2
            print(X * b + a)

#State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
```

### Conclusion:
The given program contains logical errors and incorrect variable names, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
