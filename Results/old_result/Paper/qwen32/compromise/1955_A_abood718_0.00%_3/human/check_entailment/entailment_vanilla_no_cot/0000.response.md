Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program has a logical error in the last part of the `else` statement. It incorrectly prints the value of `X` (which is `A // 2`), and then it calculates the cost incorrectly. The correct calculation should be `X * C + B` (which is the cost for `X` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price plus the cost of one additional yogurt at the regular price). However, the program prints `X` before printing the correct cost, and it does not return the correct cost in the last case.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        else:
            X = A // 2
            Y = A % 2
            print(X * C + Y * B)

# Example usage
func()
```

In this corrected version, the program calculates the minimum cost correctly by considering the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price and the number of additional yogurts that need to be bought at the regular price.
