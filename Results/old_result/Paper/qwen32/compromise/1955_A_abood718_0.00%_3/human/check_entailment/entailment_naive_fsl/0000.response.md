Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum cost for all possible cases. Let's analyze the code and find a potential issue.

Here is the problematic part of the code:
```python
else:
    X = A // 2
    print(X)
    print(X * C + B)
```
In this part, the code prints `X` (which is `A // 2`) before calculating and printing the actual cost. This print statement should be removed. Additionally, the logic for calculating the cost when `A` is odd is incorrect. The correct logic should be to buy as many pairs as possible and then buy the remaining yogurt at the regular price.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        else:
            pairs = A // 2
            remainder = A % 2
            print(pairs * C + remainder * B)

```
The corrected code ensures that the minimum cost is calculated by buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible and then buying the remaining yogurt at the regular price if necessary.

Let's test the original code with the provided example:
For the input:
```
4
2 5 9
3 5 9
3 5 11
4 5 11
```

The original code would produce:
```
1
9
1
2
15
2
20
```

The correct output should be:
```
9
14
15
20
```

As we can see, the original code does not produce the correct output for the third and fourth test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
