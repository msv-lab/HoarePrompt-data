Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts. The price for one yogurt is `a` burles, and the price for two yogurts on promotion is `b` burles. We need to determine the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy `n` yogurts.

### Key Observations:
1. **Promotion vs. Regular Price**: 
   - If `2*a < b`, it is cheaper to buy yogurts individually rather than in pairs.
   - Otherwise, buying in pairs is more economical.

2. **Even vs. Odd Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `n` is even, Maxim can always buy `n/2` pairs.
   - If `n` is odd, Maxim can buy `(n-1)/2` pairs and one yogurt individually.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`. It then decides the minimum cost based on the conditions described above.

Let's break down the logic in the code:
- **Condition 1**: `if B * 2 < C`:
  - Here, `B` is `a` and `C` is `b`. If `2*a < b`, it prints `A * B`, which is `n * a`. This is correct as buying individually is cheaper.
- **Condition 2**: `elif A % 2 == 0`:
  - If `n` is even, it prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which is `n * b / 2`. This is correct as buying `n/2` pairs is the best option.
- **Else**:
  - If `n` is odd, it calculates `X = A // 2` (which is `(n-1)/2` pairs) and prints `X * C + B`. This is correct as it buys `(n-1)/2` pairs and one yogurt individually.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Output Issue in the Else Block**:
   - The program prints `X` on a separate line before printing the final cost, which is incorrect. This will cause the output to be malformed and not match the expected format.

### Corrected Code:
The corrected code should remove the extra print statement in the else block.

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)

# This corrected code should now correctly solve the problem.
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has a logical issue with an extra print statement in the else block, which causes the output to be incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
