Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to reconstruct a palindrome array `a` of size `n` from the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays.
- A palindrome means `a[i] = a[n - i - 1]`.
- We have a function to generate all subarray sums (`func_1`), a function to filter out duplicate sums (`func_2`), a function to reconstruct the array from the filtered sums (`func_3`), and a function to find the missing subarray sum (`func_4`).

### Analysis of Functions:

#### Function 1: `func_1(a)`
- This function generates all possible subarray sums of the array `a`.
- It iterates through each starting point `i` and calculates the cumulative sum for each ending point `j`, appending each sum to the list `cts`.
- This function is correct for generating subarray sums.

#### Function 2: `func_2(cts)`
- This function takes a list of subarray sums `cts` and filters out duplicates by maintaining an `odds` list.
- If the current sum `ct` is the same as the last element in `odds`, it removes the last element (indicating a duplicate sum).
- Otherwise, it adds `ct` to `odds`.
- This function is correct for filtering out duplicate sums, assuming the input list `cts` is sorted.

#### Function 3: `func_3(odds, n)`
- This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the filtered subarray sums `odds`.
- It initializes an array `a` of size `n` with zeros.
- It iterates through `odds` in reverse order, setting the middle element if `idx == n - 1 - idx` and otherwise setting symmetric elements from the middle outward.
- It calculates the value of each element as `(x - prev) // 2`, where `x` is the current sum and `prev` is the previous sum.
- This function assumes that the sums in `odds` are in ascending order and correctly reconstructs the palindrome.

#### Function 4: `func_4(bigList, smallList)`
- This function finds the missing subarray sum by comparing the sorted list of all subarray sums (`bigList`) with the list of given subarray sums (`smallList`).
- It removes common elements from the end of both lists until they differ, returning the last element of `bigList` as the missing sum.
- This function is correct for identifying the missing subarray sum.

### Overall Process:
1. Generate all subarray sums using `func_1`.
2. Sort these sums.
3. Filter out duplicates using `func_2`.
4. Reconstruct the array using `func_3`.
5. Identify the missing subarray sum using `func_4`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the steps required to solve the problem. It generates all subarray sums, filters out duplicates, reconstructs the palindrome array, and identifies the missing subarray sum. Given that the input constraints are respected and the functions are logically sound, the program should work correctly for the given problem.

**Correctness: True**
