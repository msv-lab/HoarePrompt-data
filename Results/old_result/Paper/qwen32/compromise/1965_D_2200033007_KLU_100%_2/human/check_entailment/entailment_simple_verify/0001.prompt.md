You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

    #
    #### Example:
    #If `cts = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]`, the loop will produce `odds = [1, 3, 4]` because:
    #- Start with `odds = []`
    #- Add `1` → `odds = [1]`
    #- Add `2` → `odds = [1, 2]`
    #- Skip `2` because it matches the last element of `odds` → `odds = [1]`
    #- Add `3` → `odds = [1, 3]`
    #- Skip `3` because it matches the last element of `odds` → `odds = [1]`
    #- Skip `3` because it matches the last element of `odds` → `odds = [1]`
    #- Add `4` → `odds = [1, 4]`
    #
    #However, the correct sequence should be `odds = [1, 3, 4]` as per the logic described.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state is:

    return odds
    #The program returns `odds`, which contains the elements of `cts` with consecutive duplicates removed.

    #State: 
    return a
    #The program returns the value of variable 'a'

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze how it reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the given subarray sums. Let's break down the logic of the functions step-by-step.

### Function 1: `func_1(a)`
This function generates all possible subarray sums of the array `a` and returns them sorted. It iterates through each starting point `i` and calculates the cumulative sum up to each endpoint `j`, appending each sum to the list `cts`.

### Function 2: `func_2(cts)`
This function processes the list of subarray sums `cts` to identify the unique subarray sums. It uses a stack-like approach where if the current sum is the same as the last element in the `odds` list, it pops the last element; otherwise, it appends the current sum. This effectively removes pairs of identical sums, leaving only the unique sums.

### Function 3: `func_3(odds, n)`
This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the unique subarray sums `odds`. It initializes an array `a` of size `n` with zeros. It then iterates through the `odds` list, filling in the values of `a` based on the differences between consecutive sums in `odds`. The key here is that since `a` is a palindrome, the values at symmetric positions are equal. The function handles the middle element separately if `n` is odd.

### Function 4: `func_4(bigList, smallList)`
This function finds the missing subarray sum by comparing the sorted list of all subarray sums (`bigList`) with the list of given subarray sums (`smallList`). It removes common elements from the end of both lists and returns the last element of `bigList`, which is the missing sum.

### Overall Process
1. **Generate All Subarray Sums**: `func_1(a)` generates all subarray sums of the unknown palindrome `a`.
2. **Identify Unique Sums**: `func_2(cts)` identifies the unique subarray sums.
3. **Reconstruct the Palindrome**: `func_3(odds, n)` reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the unique subarray sums.
4. **Find Missing Sum**: `func_4(bigList, smallList)` finds the missing subarray sum, although this step is not directly used in the reconstruction process.

### Analysis
The core of the solution lies in correctly identifying the unique subarray sums and using them to reconstruct the palindrome array. The provided functions seem to handle these tasks correctly, assuming the input constraints and guarantees are met.

- **Generating Subarray Sums**: `func_1` correctly generates all subarray sums.
- **Identifying Unique Sums**: `func_2` correctly identifies the unique subarray sums by removing duplicates.
- **Reconstructing the Palindrome**: `func_3` correctly reconstructs the palindrome array by leveraging the properties of palindromes and the differences between consecutive unique sums.

Given that the problem guarantees there is always at least one valid solution and the constraints are respected, the provided program should correctly reconstruct the palindrome array for each test case.

### Conclusion
The program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the steps necessary to solve the problem as described.
