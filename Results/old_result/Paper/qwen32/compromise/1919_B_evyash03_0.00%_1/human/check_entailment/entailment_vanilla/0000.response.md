Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Understanding the Problem
The problem requires us to split a given string `s` into non-empty subarrays such that the sum of penalties for these subarrays is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length.

### Analyzing the Program
The provided program does not seem to implement an optimal solution to the problem. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the program’s logic and its shortcomings:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.

2. **Splitting the String:**
   - The program splits the string `s` by the character `'-'`, resulting in a list of substrings `parts`.
   - It then calculates the total length of these parts, `result_length`, which is essentially the number of `'+'` characters in `s` (plus the number of empty strings, but these are ignored by `len(part)`).

3. **Calling `func_1`:**
   - The program calls a function `func_1` with the original string `expression` and the calculated `result_length`.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes `count` to 0 and `balance` to 0.
   - It iterates over each character in the string `expression`.
     - If the character is `'+'`, it increments `balance` by 1.
     - If the character is `'-'`, it decrements `balance` by 1.
     - If `balance` becomes negative, it increments `count` by 1 and resets `balance` to 0.
   - After the loop, it adds 1 to `count` if `balance` is greater than 0.
   - The function returns `count`.

### Issues with the Program
- **Incorrect Penalty Calculation:** The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the penalty as described in the problem statement. It merely counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds 1 if the final balance is positive. This does not account for the absolute value of the sum of subarrays or the length of these subarrays.
- **Optimal Splitting:** The program does not perform any optimal splitting of the array. It only counts certain transitions in the balance, which is not related to minimizing the total penalty.

### Correct Approach
To solve this problem optimally, one would need to use dynamic programming or a greedy approach to find the optimal way to split the array such that the total penalty is minimized. This involves considering all possible splits and calculating the penalties correctly.

### Conclusion
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not compute the minimum possible penalty according to the problem's requirements.

**Correctness: False**
