To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's analyze the given code.

The loop iterates through each character in the string `s` which is a balanced parentheses sequence. The variable `balance` is used to keep track of the net count of open parentheses. It is incremented when encountering an open parenthesis '(' and decremented when encountering a closing parenthesis ')'. The `details` list stores tuples containing the current `balance`, the negative index of the character in the string, and the character itself.

Since `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, by the end of the loop, `balance` will be 0 because every open parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis.

Let's break down what happens in each iteration:
- For each open parenthesis '(', `balance` is incremented by 1.
- For each closing parenthesis ')', `balance` is decremented by 1.
- The `details` list is populated with tuples of the form `(balance, -i, char)` where `i` is the index of the character in the string, and `char` is the character itself.

Since the string is balanced, the `balance` will return to 0 after processing all characters. The `details` list will contain a record of the `balance` at each step, the negative index, and the character.

Thus, the final output state will be:
- `s` remains unchanged as it is the input string.
- `balance` will be 0.
- `details` will be a list of tuples with the `balance` at each step, the negative index of the character, and the character itself.

Output State: **s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that s is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, balance is 0, details is a list of tuples (balance, -i, char) for each character in s.**
