You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `n` remains unchanged. The final values of `s`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are based on the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters and prints 'NO' if the string contains exactly two distinct characters, otherwise it prints 'YES'. If the string is not already sorted in ascending order, it prints the string sorted in ascending order; otherwise, it prints the string sorted in descending order.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Checking Uniqueness of Characters**:
   - The program creates a set `a` from the string `s`. This set contains unique characters from `s`.
   - If the length of `a` is 2, it means there are only two distinct characters in `s`. In this case, the program outputs "NO" because no matter how you rearrange a string with only two distinct characters, if the original string has repeated characters, it will always be possible to rearrange it into the same string. For example, for "aabb", any rearrangement will still be "aabb" in some form.

3. **Generating a Different String**:
   - If the length of `a` is not 2, the program outputs "YES" and proceeds to generate a different string.
   - It sorts the string `s` in ascending order and stores it in `b`.
   - It also sorts the string `s` in descending order and stores it in `c`.
   - The program checks if the sorted string `b` is the same as the original string `s`. If it is, it prints `c` (the reverse sorted string). Otherwise, it prints `b` (the sorted string).

4. **Logic for Correctness**:
   - The logic for handling the case where there are exactly two distinct characters is correct. If there are only two characters, and one of them is repeated, no rearrangement can produce a different string.
   - For cases with more than two distinct characters, the program correctly generates a different string by sorting it. Sorting the string will always produce a different string unless the original string is already sorted in ascending or descending order, in which case the program handles this by checking and using the reverse sorted string instead.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case of a single character string correctly, as it will have a length of 1 for the set `a`, and thus will not trigger the "NO" condition.
   - The program also handles the edge case of strings with all identical characters correctly, as it will have a set length of 1, and thus will not trigger the "NO" condition.

**Conclusion**:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a rearranged string can be formed and outputs the correct result for each test case based on the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
