Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an integer read from the input; `s` is a list containing either 30 or 31 elements, with the first 29 elements each either the string `'1'`, `'0'`, or `'-1'`. If `flag` is 0 and `s[29]` is `'0'`, `s` has 30 elements and `flag` remains 0. If `flag` is not 0 and `s[29]` is `'0'`, `s` has 31 elements with the 30th element being `'0'` and the 31st element being `'1'`, and `flag` is set to 0. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is `'1'`, `s` has 30 elements with `s[29]` now being `'1'` and `flag` is set to 1. `length` is either 30 or 31, matching the number of elements in `s`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer read from the input, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `x` is an integer read from the input; `s` is a list containing either 30 or 31 elements, with the first 29 elements each either the string `'1'`, `'0'`, or `'-1'`. If `s[i] == '-1'` and `s[i - 1] == '1'`, then `s[i - 1]` is now `'-1'`. `flag` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions; `length` is either 30 or 31, matching the number of elements in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer read from the input, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `x` is an integer read from the input; `s` is a list containing either 30 or 31 elements, with the first 29 elements each either the string `'1'`, `'0'`, or `'-1'`. If `s[3] == '-1'` and `s[4] == '1'`, then `s[3]` is updated to `'-1'` and `s[4]` is updated to `'0'`. `flag` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions; `length` is either 30 or 31, matching the number of elements in `s`; `i` is 4.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer read from the input, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `x` is an integer read from the input; `s` is a list containing either 30 or 31 elements, with the first 29 elements each either the string `'1'`, `'0'`, or `'-1'`. If `s[5] == '-1'` and `s[4] == '1'`, then `s[5]` is updated to `'0'` and `s[4]` is updated to `'-1'`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged. `flag` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions; `length` is either 30 or 31, matching the number of elements in `s`; `i` is 5.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
