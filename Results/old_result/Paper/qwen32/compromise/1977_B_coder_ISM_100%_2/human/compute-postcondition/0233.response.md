To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `length`.

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `length - 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, let's call it `i_prev`.
- Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.
- The variable `length` remains unchanged throughout the iterations.

### Given State:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `length` is greater than 1.
- `s` is a sequence, but its specific values are not relevant to adjusting the loop variables.

### Adjustment:
- Since the loop increments `i` by 1, if `i` was `i_prev` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `i_prev + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
- `length` remains the same.

### Conclusion:
If `i` was `i_prev` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`. Since we don't know the exact value of `i_prev`, we can generalize that `i` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

### Final State:
State: **`length` is greater than 1, `s` is a sequence, `i` is `i + 1`** 

However, to be more precise based on the given information, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be 4. But since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can represent the state as:

State: **`length` is greater than 1, `s` is a sequence, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value** 

For concreteness, if we assume `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then:

State: **`length` is greater than 1, `s` is a sequence, `i` is 4**
