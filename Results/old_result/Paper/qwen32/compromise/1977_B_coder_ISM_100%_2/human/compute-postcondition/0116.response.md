Postcondition: **`i` is 0. If `flag` was originally 0 and `s[i]` was '1' and `s[i + 1]` was also '1', then `flag` is now 1, `s[i]` is '-1', and `s[i + 1]` is '1'. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1, then `flag` is changed to 0 and `s[i]` is changed to '0'. If `flag` remains 0, `s[i]` remains '1'. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'.**
