Postcondition: **`length` is greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `s[i]` is `'0'` and `s[i - 1]` is `'-1'`, then the condition `(s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1')` was false, and no other changes were made to `s[i]` or `s[i - 1]`. Otherwise, if the condition was true, `s[i]` is `'0'` and `s[i - 1]` is `'-1'`.**
