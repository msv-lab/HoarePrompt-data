The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 30. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value between 0 and 29 (inclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4;
- `x` is an integer read from the input;
- `s` is a list containing either the string `'1'` or the string `'0'`;
- `length` is 30.

And knowing that `i` is currently at some value `k` (where 0 ≤ `k` < 30), at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an integer read from the input; `s` is a list containing either the string `'1'` or the string `'0'`; `length` is 30; `i` is `k + 1`**

Since we don't know the exact value of `k`, we can generalize it to say that `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

So the final answer is:
State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an integer read from the input; `s` is a list containing either the string `'1'` or the string `'0'`; `length` is 30; `i` is incremented by 1**
