The given code snippet sets the 30th element of the list `s` (which is indexed at `i = 29`) to `'-1'`. This change affects only the list `s`, and none of the other variables (`t`, `x`, `length`, `flag`, or `i`) are modified by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an integer read from the input; `s` is a list containing 30 elements, with the 30th element being `'-1'` and the other elements each either the string `'1'` or the string `'0'`; `length` is 30; `flag` is either 0 or 1; `i` is 29.**
