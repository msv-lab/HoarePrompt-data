The given code sets `flag` to 1. This change does not affect the condition regarding `s[1]` unless `flag` was previously 0 and `s[1]` was `'0'`. Since the new value of `flag` is 1, the condition for changing `s[1]` to `'-1'` and setting `flag` to 0 is no longer met.

Therefore, the only change is that `flag` is now 1. The value of `i` remains 1, and the state of `s[1]` remains unchanged unless it was `'0'` and `flag` was 0 before the code execution. Since `flag` is now set to 1, `s[1]` will not be changed to `'-1'`.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `flag` is 1; If `s[1]` was `'0'` and `flag` was 0, then `s[1]` would be `'-1'` and `flag` would be 0, otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
