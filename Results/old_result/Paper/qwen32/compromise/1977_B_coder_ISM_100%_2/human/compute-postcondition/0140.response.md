Postcondition: **The list `s` will have been modified such that any consecutive '1's will have one of them replaced with '-1' and the subsequent '1' will be flipped if `flag` is 1. The `flag` will be 0 unless the last operation sets it to 1 and there are no more '0's to flip to '1'. Additionally, either `flag` is 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'.**
