`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `t` is now an integer read from the input. The initial conditions about `t` being between 1 and 10^4 remain valid. The values of `x` for each test case are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; for each of the `t` test cases, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < 2^30.**
