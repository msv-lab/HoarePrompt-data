Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `x`. For each test case, it transforms the binary representation of `x` according to specific rules to produce a modified binary string `s` and its length. The transformation ensures no consecutive '1' and '-1' pairs exist in `s`. The function outputs the length of the modified binary string and the string itself for each test case.**
