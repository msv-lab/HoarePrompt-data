The given Python code snippet is:

```python
s = []
```

This line of code reassigns the variable `s` to an empty list, effectively discarding its previous content.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer read from the input, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `x` is a new integer read from the input
- `s` is a list containing either 30 or 31 elements, with no consecutive `'1'` and `'-1'` elements
- `flag` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions
- `length` is either 30 or 31, matching the number of elements in `s`
- `nalla` is incremented by 1

After executing the line `s = []`, the list `s` is now an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `x` is a new integer read from the input; `s` is an empty list; `flag` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions; `length` is either 30 or 31, matching the number of elements in `s`; `nalla` is incremented by 1.**
