The code changes the element at index `i-1` of the sequence `s` from '1' to '-1'. The value of `length` remains unchanged and still must be greater than 1. The element at index `i` remains '0'.

Output State: **`length` must be greater than 1, `s` is a sequence where the element at index `i` is '0' and the element at index `i-1` is '-1'.**
