Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an integer read from the input; `s` is a list containing either 30 or 31 elements, with the first 29 elements each either the string `'1'`, `'0'`, or `'-1'`. If `flag` is 0 and `s[29]` is `'0'`, `s` has 30 elements and `flag` remains 0. If `flag` is not 0 and `s[29]` is `'0'`, `s` has 31 elements with the 30th element being `'0'` and the 31st element being `'1'`, and `flag` is set to 0. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is `'1'`, `s` has 30 elements with `s[29]` now being `'1'` and `flag` is set to 1. `length` is either 30 or 31, matching the number of elements in `s`.**
