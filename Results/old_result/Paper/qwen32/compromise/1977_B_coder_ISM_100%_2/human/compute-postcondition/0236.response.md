Postcondition: **`length` is greater than 1, `s` is a sequence, `i` is 4. If the element at index 3 of `s` is `'1'` and the element at index 4 of `s` is `'-1'`, then the element at index 3 of `s` is set to `'-1'` and the element at index 4 of `s` is set to `'0'`. Otherwise, the sequence `s` remains unchanged.**
