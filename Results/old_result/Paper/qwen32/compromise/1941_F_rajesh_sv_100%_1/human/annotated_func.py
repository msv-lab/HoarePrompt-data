#State of the program right berfore the function call: func is a function.
def func_1(func):
    d = {}
    return wrapper
    #The program returns the function `wrapper`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a function `func` as a parameter and returns another function named `wrapper`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple containing any number of arguments that the function `func` can accept.
def wrapper():
    if (args not in d) :
        d[args] = func(*args)
    #State: `args` is a tuple containing any number of arguments that the function `func` can accept. If `args` was not already a key in the dictionary `d`, a new key-value pair is added to `d` where the key is `args` and the value is `func(*args)`. If `args` was already a key in `d`, no changes are made to `d`.
    return d[args]
    #The program returns the value associated with the key `args` in the dictionary `d`. If `args` was not in `d` before the function was called, it adds `args` as a key with the value being the result of `func(*args)`. If `args` was already in `d`, it simply returns the existing value without making any changes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `args` containing any number of arguments. It returns the value associated with the key `args` in the dictionary `d`. If `args` is not already in `d`, it computes the result of `func(*args)`, stores it in `d` with `args` as the key, and then returns this value. If `args` is already in `d`, it simply returns the existing value without any further computation.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_2()`. This function is expected to read a line from standard input and return it as a stripped string, but it does not take any parameters.
def func_2():

    #The program returns a stripped string that is read from standard input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a line from standard input, removes any leading or trailing whitespace from it, and returns the resulting string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature. The function `func_3` does not take any arguments and does not provide any information about the variables used in the overall problem context based on the given code snippet.
def func_3():

    #The program returns the integer value of whatever `func_2()` returns.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and returns the integer value returned by the function `func_2`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: delimiter is a string used to split the input string into a list of integers.
def func_4(delimiter):
    return list(map(int, func_2().split(delimiter)))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the string returned by `func_2()` using the `delimiter` string and converting each split segment into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` takes a string `delimiter` as input, splits the string returned by `func_2()` using this delimiter, converts each segment into an integer, and returns a list of these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function signature is not provided, but based on the context, it seems to be a placeholder or a function that relies on other defined functions. No specific variables are mentioned in the signature to describe preconditions.

    #The program returns the value returned by func_2()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns the value returned by the function `func_2`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and prints the maximum value between the second largest difference between consecutive complexities of prepared problems and a computed value based on the complexities of functions and models.
