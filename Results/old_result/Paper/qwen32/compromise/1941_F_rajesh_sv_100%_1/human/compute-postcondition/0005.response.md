The only variable in the loop head is `testcases`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `testcases`. If `testcases` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()` minus 1 and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `testcases` must still be greater than 0. Since `testcases` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `testcases` should be the value it currently holds minus 1, but it must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

State: **`testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()` minus 2 and must be greater than 0**
