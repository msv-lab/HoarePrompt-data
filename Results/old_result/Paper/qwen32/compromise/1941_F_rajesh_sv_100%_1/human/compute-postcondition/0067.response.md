The code snippet assigns values to `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` based on the current value of `mid`, `D`, and `f`. 

- `mid_sum` is assigned the value of `D[mid] + f`.
- `mid_next_sum` is assigned the value of `D[mid + 1] + f`.

Given the initial state, `mid` is already defined, and `D` and `f` are unchanged. Therefore, the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` can be directly calculated as described.

Output State: **`A` is a sorted list of n integers, `m` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers with at least 2 elements, `F` is equal to `D`, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` that, when subtracted by its previous element, gives the maximum difference, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `l` is the index in `D` where `left - f` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, `f` is the second element of `F`, `l` remains equal to `h` (before the update), `h` is now `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `ans` is set to the minimum of `max_diff`, `D[l] + f - left`, and `right - D[l] - f`, and `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**
