The code snippet provided sets `max_diff` to the value of `diff`. Since `diff` is defined as `A[5] - A[4]`, `max_diff` will now hold this value. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`A` is a sorted list of `n` integers representing the complexities of the prepared problems; `m` is unchanged; `k` is unchanged; `D` is a sorted list of unique integers returned by `func_4()`, and `F` is equal to `D`; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 5; `diff` is `A[5] - A[4]`; `max_diff` is `A[5] - A[4]`; `next_max_diff` is equal to `max_diff`.**
