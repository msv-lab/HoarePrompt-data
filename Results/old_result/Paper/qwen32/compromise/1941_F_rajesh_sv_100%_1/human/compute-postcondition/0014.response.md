Postcondition: **`A` is a sorted list of `n` integers representing the complexities of the prepared problems; `m` is unchanged; `k` is unchanged; `D` is a sorted list of unique integers returned by `func_4()`, and `F` is equal to `D`; `max_diff` is `-inf`; `next_max_diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]` if `diff > next_max_diff`, otherwise `next_max_diff` remains unchanged; `index` is `None`; `n` is greater than 1; `diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]` and `diff` is less than or equal to `max_diff`.**
