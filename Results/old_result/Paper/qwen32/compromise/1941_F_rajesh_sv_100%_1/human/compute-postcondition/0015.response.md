Postcondition: **`A` is a sorted list of `n` integers representing the complexities of the prepared problems; `m` is unchanged; `k` is unchanged; `D` is a sorted list of unique integers returned by `func_4()`, and `F` is equal to `D`; `n` is greater than 1; `diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff`, `next_max_diff` remains `-inf`, and `index` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains unchanged, `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, and `index` remains `None`.**
