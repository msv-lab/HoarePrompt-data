The value of `testcases` is reassigned to the value returned by the function `func_3()`. The initial state only mentioned that `testcases` was a positive integer, but now it holds whatever value `func_3()` returns. The output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()`**.
