Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, the array should be sorted in either ascending or descending order, and the beauty is maximized by the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in this sorted order.

The current program only calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the sorted array, which is not the correct approach to compute the maximum beauty as described. Instead, the program should compute the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        beauty = sum(a[i] - a[i - 1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)

func()
```

This version correctly computes the maximum beauty by sorting the array and summing the differences between consecutive elements.
