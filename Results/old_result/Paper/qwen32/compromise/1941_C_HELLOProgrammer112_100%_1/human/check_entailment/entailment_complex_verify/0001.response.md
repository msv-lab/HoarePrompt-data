### Reasoning:
The given program's logic is flawed because it does not correctly account for the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie". The current approach simply counts the occurrences of "map", "pie", and "mapie" and then calculates `x + y - z`. This method does not handle overlapping substrings or the optimal removal strategy.

For example, consider the string "mapie":
- The program counts 1 occurrence of "map", 1 occurrence of "pie", and 1 occurrence of "mapie", resulting in `1 + 1 - 1 = 1`.
- However, to make this string beautiful, we need to remove 2 characters (either 'm' and 'p' from "map" or 'p' and 'i' from "pie").

The original assessment is correct in pointing out that the program's logic is incorrect. The provided code does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. A more sophisticated method, such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm, would be needed to solve this problem correctly.

### Final:
Final: **False**
