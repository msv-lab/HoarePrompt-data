The code snippet `n, k = func_2()` assigns the first two values returned by `func_2()` to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` is initially the first value returned by `func_2()`, and `k` is initially 0. After executing the code, `n` will be updated to the first value returned by `func_2()` (which may or may not be the same as its initial value), and `k` will be updated to the second value returned by `func_2()`.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list; `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is greater than 1; `combined` is an empty list; `current_profit` reflects the net profit after processing all items; `max_profit` holds the maximum profit encountered during the loop.`**
