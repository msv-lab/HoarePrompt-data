Postcondition: **`heap` contains the last `k` elements of the original `combined` list in the order they were popped; `k` is 0; `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `remaining_items`, `test_cases` remain unchanged. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.**
