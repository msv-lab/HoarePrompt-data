Postcondition: **`heap` contains the last `k` tuples from the original `combined` list in the order they were popped (which is still 0, so it remains empty); `k` is 0; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is greater than 0; `combined` is an empty list; `item` is the last element that was in `combined`; `removed_item` is equal to `item`. If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is decreased by `item[1]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`.**
