Output State: **`heap` contains the last `k` tuples from the original `combined` list if `combined` had at least `k` tuples; `k` is `0`; `combined` has `len(combined) - k` tuples remaining and `combined` is not empty; `n` is `n_value`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and still greater than 0; `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`; `max_profit` is `0`.**

Explanation: The value of `current_profit` is updated to the value returned by the function `func_3(combined, heap)`. All other variables retain their previous values.
