The `heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` operation pushes `item` onto the heap and then pops the smallest element from the heap. Given that `k` is 0, initially `heap` is empty. After pushing `item` onto the heap, the heap will contain `item`, and since there's only one element, popping will remove `item` itself.

Here's the impact on the variables:
- `heap` will now contain `item` after the push, and then `item` will be removed during the pop, making `heap` empty again.
- `removed_item` will be assigned the value of `item` because `item` is the only element in the heap when it gets popped.

No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`heap` contains the last `k` tuples from the original `combined` list in the order they were popped (which is still 0, so it remains empty); `k` is 0; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is greater than 0; `combined` has one less element than before; `item` is the last element that was in `combined`; `removed_item` is equal to `item`; If the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is reduced by `item[1]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`.**
