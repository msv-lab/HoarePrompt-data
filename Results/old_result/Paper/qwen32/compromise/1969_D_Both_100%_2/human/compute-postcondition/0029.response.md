To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the condition specified in the loop head. The loop will execute as long as `combined` is not empty.

Given the state right before the `while` loop:
- `heap` contains the last `k` tuples from the original `combined` list in the order they were popped.
- `k` is 0.
- `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`.
- `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`.
- `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `remaining_items` is an empty list.
- `test_cases` is greater than 0.
- `current_profit` and `max_profit` are compared, but this comparison does not affect the loop condition directly.

The loop condition is `while combined:`. For the loop to execute at least once, `combined` must not be empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `combined` contains at least one element.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `combined`.
2. **Adjust `combined`**: To ensure the loop executes, `combined` must contain at least one element.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`heap` contains the last `k` tuples from the original `combined` list in the order they were popped; `k` is 0; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is greater than 0; `combined` must contain at least one element.**

This ensures that the `while combined:` loop can execute at least once.
