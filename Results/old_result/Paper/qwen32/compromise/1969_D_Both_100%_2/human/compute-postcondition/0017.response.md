The code snippet removes the last tuple from the `combined` list and pushes it onto the `heap`. This means that the `heap` now contains the tuple that was previously the last element of `combined`, and `combined` has one less tuple than it did before.

Given the initial state, the only variables that are affected are `heap` and `combined`.

- `heap` now includes the last tuple from the original `combined` list.
- `combined` has one less tuple than it did initially.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` contains the last tuple from the original `combined` list if `combined` was not empty; `combined` has one less tuple than before if `combined` was not empty; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is greater than 0, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, and `test_cases` is greater than 0.**
