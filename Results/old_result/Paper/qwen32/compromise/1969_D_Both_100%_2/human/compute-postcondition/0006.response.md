The code snippet provided transforms the `prices` list into a new list called `neg_prices`, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in the `prices` list.

Given the initial state, `neg_prices` was initially a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice. After executing the code snippet, `neg_prices` will now contain the negated values of the `prices` list.

Since the exact values of `prices` are not specified, we can only describe the transformation in terms of the relationship between `prices` and `neg_prices`.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of integers representing the bonuses Alice receives from selling items to Bob, `max_profit` is an integer representing the maximum profit Alice can achieve, `current_profit` is an integer representing the current profit Alice has, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the negative price and bonus of an item, `test_cases` must be greater than 0.**

In simpler terms, `neg_prices` now contains the negated values of `prices`. All other variables remain unchanged.
