The code snippet `current_profit -= item[1]` subtracts the second element of the tuple `item` from `current_profit`. 

Given the initial state, `item` is the last element that was in `combined` and satisfies the condition that the sum of its first and second elements is greater than or equal to 0. Since `item` is a tuple, `item[1]` refers to the second element of this tuple.

Therefore, `current_profit` is reduced by the value of `item[1]`.

Output State: **`heap` contains the last `k` tuples from the original `combined` list in the order they were popped; `k` is 0; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is greater than 0; `combined` has one less element than before; `item` is the last element that was in `combined` and satisfies the condition that the sum of its first and second elements is greater than or equal to 0; `current_profit` is reduced by `item[1]`.**
