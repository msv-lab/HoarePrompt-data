The code snippet creates a new list `neg_prices` by taking each element from the `prices` list, negating it, and storing it in the new list. This means that each price in the `prices` list is multiplied by -1.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list; `k` is `k_value`; `combined` is empty; `n` is `n_value`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`; `bonuses`, `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and still greater than 0; `current_profit` is the net profit after processing all items; `max_profit` is the maximum profit encountered during the loop.`**

In simple terms, the `neg_prices` list now contains the negative values of the original `prices` list, while all other variables remain unchanged.
