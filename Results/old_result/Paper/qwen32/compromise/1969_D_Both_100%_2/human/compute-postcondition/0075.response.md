The code sorts the `combined` list based on the second element of each tuple. This means that the order of elements in `combined` changes such that the tuples are arranged in ascending order according to their bonus values (second element of each tuple).

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `combined`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list; `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is greater than 1; `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0.**
