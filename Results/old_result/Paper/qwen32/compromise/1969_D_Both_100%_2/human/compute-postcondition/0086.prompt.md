Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `heap` is an empty list; `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is greater than 1; `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(k):
    if combined:
        heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `heap` is a list containing the tuple that was the last element of `combined` if `combined` was not empty. `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()` and must be greater than 0. `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`. `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`. `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `remaining_items` is an empty list. `test_cases` is greater than 1. `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple, with the last tuple removed if `combined` was not empty. `current_profit` is 0. `max_profit` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `heap` contains the previously last element of `combined` (if `combined` was not empty before) plus the new last element of `combined` after the pop operation if `combined` is not empty. If `combined` is empty, `heap` remains unchanged. `combined` has one less element than before if it was not empty. `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()` minus 1 and must be greater than 0. `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`. `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`. `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `remaining_items` is an empty list. `test_cases` is greater than 1. `current_profit` is 0. `max_profit` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `heap` contains the previously last element of `combined` (if `combined` was not empty before) plus the new last element of `combined` after the pop operation if `combined` is not empty; `combined` has one less element than before if it was not empty; `k` is 1; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is greater than 1; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0. If `combined` is empty, none of these changes occur.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
