The given Python code snippet is:

```python
heap = []
```

This line of code reassigns the `heap` variable to a new empty list. None of the other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `heap` is reassigned to an empty list. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list; `k` is 0; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is greater than 1; `combined` is an empty list; `current_profit` reflects the net profit after processing all items; `max_profit` holds the maximum profit encountered during the loop.**
