The only variable in the loop head is `combined`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether `combined` contains any elements. If `combined` contains at least one more tuple, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `combined` contains at least one more tuple, but since we need to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we should confirm that `combined` still has elements.

State: **`heap` contains `item` and the smallest element from the original `heap` is replaced by `item`; `removed_item` is the smallest element from the original `heap`; `combined` contains at least one more tuple; `n` is `n_value`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and still greater than 0; `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined`; `current_profit` is updated based on the conditions given; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged; `combined` must contain at least one more tuple**
