The `while` loop condition is `while combined:`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as the `combined` list is not empty.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `combined` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute one more time, `combined` must not be empty. Therefore, we need to adjust the state so that `combined` contains at least one item.

State: **`heap` contains the `item`; `k` is 0; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is greater than 0; `combined` is not an empty list; `item` is the last element that was in `combined`; `removed_item` is equal to `item`; if `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is decreased by `item[0]`; `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`.**
