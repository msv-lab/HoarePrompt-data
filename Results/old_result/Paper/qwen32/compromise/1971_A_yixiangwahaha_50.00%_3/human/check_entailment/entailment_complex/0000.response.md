Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to read a number of test cases and then, for each test case, output the minimum and maximum of two given integers. However, there is a discrepancy between the problem description and the implementation. The problem description states that there can be up to 100 test cases, but the program is hardcoded to only handle exactly 10 test cases. This means that if the input `t` is not 10, the program will not work as expected.

For example, if `t` is 5, the program will still attempt to read 10 lines of input, which will lead to errors or incorrect behavior. Conversely, if `t` is greater than 10, the program will only process the first 10 test cases and ignore the rest.

Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
