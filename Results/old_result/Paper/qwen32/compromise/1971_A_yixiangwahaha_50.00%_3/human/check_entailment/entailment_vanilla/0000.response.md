Reasoning:

1. The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input. However, it does not use this value `t` to determine the number of iterations in the loop. Instead, it assumes there will always be exactly 10 test cases, which is not in line with the problem statement where `t` can vary from 1 to 100.

2. The function initializes two lists, `x` and `y`, to store the integers from each test case.

3. It then reads the next 10 lines of input, assuming there are 10 test cases, and appends the first and second integers of each line to the `x` and `y` lists, respectively.

4. After reading the inputs, the function iterates over the indices from 0 to 9 (inclusive), comparing the corresponding elements in `x` and `y`. It prints the smaller number followed by the larger number for each test case.

5. However, because the function always assumes there are 10 test cases, it will not work correctly if the number of test cases `t` is not 10. If `t` is less than 10, the function will still attempt to read 10 lines of input, which will cause an error. If `t` is greater than 10, the function will only process the first 10 test cases and ignore the rest.

6. The function does correctly print the minimum and maximum of each pair of integers, assuming the correct number of test cases are provided.

Given the above points, the function is not correct because it does not handle the varying number of test cases as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
