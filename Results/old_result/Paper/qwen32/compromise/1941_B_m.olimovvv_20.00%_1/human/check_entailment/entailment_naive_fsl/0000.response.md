Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The given program checks if the first or last element of the array is odd and if the next or previous element is not exactly 2 more than the current one. However, this is not a correct way to determine if the array can be reduced to all zeros using the described operations.

The operations described in the problem allow us to reduce the elements in a specific pattern, but the program does not correctly simulate this process or check the necessary conditions for all elements in the array. Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Counterexample:**
```
Input:
1
5
1 2 2 2 1

Expected Output:
YES

Actual Output:
NO
```

In this example, the array `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]` can indeed be reduced to all zeros using the operations, but the program incorrectly outputs "NO". The correct approach would involve checking if the array can be transformed by repeatedly applying the operations to reduce all elements to zero, which is not done by the current program.

The program needs to simulate the operations or derive a more comprehensive condition to determine if the array can be reduced to all zeros, which it currently fails to do.
