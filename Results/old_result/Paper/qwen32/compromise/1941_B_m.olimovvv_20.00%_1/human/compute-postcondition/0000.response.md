For the provided task, we need to analyze the loop head and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is the integer read from the input and represents the number of test cases. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`.
   - The variable `_` is not a state that needs to be adjusted; it is simply a placeholder for iteration.
   - The critical variable here is `t`, which is the number of iterations the loop will perform.

2. **State Before the Loop:**
   - The state before the loop is given as `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`.

3. **Adjusting the State:**
   - For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 because `range(int(input()))` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `t-1`. If `t` is 0, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
   - Since the problem specifies `1 <= t <= 10^4`, the state already ensures that `t` is at least 1, so no adjustment is needed for `t` itself.

### Conclusion:
- The state before the loop is already suitable for the loop to execute because `t` is guaranteed to be at least 1.
- There are no other variables in the loop head that need adjustment.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`**
