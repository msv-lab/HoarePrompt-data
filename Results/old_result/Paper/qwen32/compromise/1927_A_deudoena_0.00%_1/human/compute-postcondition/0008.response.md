Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10.
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in `s`.
   - `inpstr` is assigned the value of the input string `s`.
   - `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `s`.
   - `ind2` is the index of the last 'B' in `s` from the end of the string.
   - `outind` is 0 (though `outind` is not used in the print statement).

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `inpstr` is assigned the value of `s`, so `len(inpstr)` is the length of the string `s`, which is `n`.
   - `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `s`.
   - `ind2` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `s` from the end of the string. This can be found using `len(s) - 1 - s[::-1].index('B')`.

4. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` translates to `n - ind2 - ind1`.
   - `ind2` can be rewritten as `len(s) - 1 - s[::-1].index('B')`, which simplifies to `n - 1 - s[::-1].index('B')`.

5. **Final Expression:**
   - Substituting `ind2` in the expression:
     \[
     n - (n - 1 - s[::-1].index('B')) - ind1 = n - n + 1 + s[::-1].index('B') - ind1 = 1 + s[::-1].index('B') - ind1
     \]
   - `s[::-1].index('B')` is the index of the first 'B' in the reversed string `s`, which corresponds to the index of the last 'B' in the original string `s` from the end of the string. So, `s[::-1].index('B')` is `len(s) - 1 - ind2`.

6. **Simplified Expression:**
   - The expression `1 + s[::-1].index('B') - ind1` simplifies to `1 + (n - 1 - ind2) - ind1 = n - ind1 - ind2`.

Thus, the print statement will output the value of `n - ind1 - ind2`, which is the length of the string `s` minus the index of the first 'B' minus the index of the last 'B'.

**Output:** **n - ind1 - ind2 (where n is the length of the string s, ind1 is the index of the first 'B' in s, and ind2 is the index of the last 'B' in s from the end of the string)**
