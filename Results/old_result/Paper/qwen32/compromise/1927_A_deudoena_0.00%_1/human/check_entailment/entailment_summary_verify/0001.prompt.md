You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program:
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a string consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', finds the index of the first 'B' and the last 'B' in the string, and prints the length of the string minus the sum of these two indices.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code and determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
We need to find the minimum length of a continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white to make the entire strip white. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a string of 'W' (white) and 'B' (black) characters.

### Approach Explanation:
The task is to find the shortest segment that, when painted white, will convert all black cells to white. The optimal segment would be from the first black cell to the last black cell in the string. This is because any segment that includes these two black cells will cover all black cells in between, and no shorter segment can cover all black cells.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to find the indices of the first and last black cells in the string and then calculates the length of the segment between them.

#### Key Points:
1. **Finding the First Black Cell:**
   - The first loop iterates through the string to find the index of the first 'B'. This is stored in `ind1`.
   
2. **Finding the Last Black Cell:**
   - The second loop iterates through the string in reverse to find the index of the last 'B'. This is stored in `ind2`, but it is actually storing the distance from the end of the string to the last 'B'. To get the actual index, we would need to use `len(inpstr) - ind2 - 1`.
   
3. **Calculating the Segment Length:**
   - The code calculates the length of the segment as `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`. However, since `ind2` is not the actual index of the last black cell but the distance from the end, this calculation is incorrect.

### Correctness:
The code does not correctly calculate the minimum length of the segment because it incorrectly computes the position of the last black cell.

### Example:
For the input "WBBWBW":
- The first black cell is at index 1.
- The last black cell is at index 4.
- The correct segment length is 4 - 1 + 1 = 4.

But the code calculates `len("WBBWBW") - ind2 - ind1` which is `6 - 1 - 1 = 4`. This happens to work for this specific example but will fail for others.

### Conclusion:
While the code happens to give the correct answer for the provided example, it does not correctly implement the logic for all cases. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
