To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand what happens in each iteration based on the provided code.

The loop runs `t` times, and in each iteration:
1. It reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input.
2. It checks if the sum of these integers is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` and continues to the next iteration.
3. If the sum is even, it calculates `x` as half of the sum and `y` as the sum of `a` and `b`.
4. It prints the minimum of `x` and `y`.

After all iterations, the variables `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The output of the loop consists of printed values for each iteration, which are either `-1` or the minimum of `x` and `y`.

Since the question asks for the output state in terms of variable values and not the printed results, the state of the variables `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remains the same.

Output State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases; p_1, p_2, and p_3 are each integers representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order.**
