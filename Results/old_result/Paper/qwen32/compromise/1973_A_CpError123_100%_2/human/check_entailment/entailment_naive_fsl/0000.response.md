Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all possible cases for the given problem. Let's analyze the program with some test cases:

The program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
```python
x = (a + b + c) // 2
y = a + b
print(min(x, y))
```
However, this approach does not ensure that the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` can be achieved through a valid set of games. Let's consider a few cases where the program might fail:

1. **Case: (1, 1, 1)**
   - The program will output `1`.
   - However, it's impossible to have scores (1, 1, 1) because if one player has 1 point, it means they either drew with one player and lost to the other or won against one player and drew with the other. In both scenarios, the other two players cannot both have exactly 1 point. Thus, the correct output should be `-1`.

2. **Case: (3, 3, 3)**
   - The program will output `4`.
   - However, it's impossible to have scores (3, 3, 3) because each player can only get a maximum of 6 points if they play 3 games (2 points per win, 1 point per draw). The only way to achieve (3, 3, 3) would be if each player wins 1 game and draws 2 games, but this would require a total of 9 games (3 games per player), which is not possible with only 3 players. Thus, the correct output should be `-1`.

3. **Case: (1, 1, 10)**
   - The program will output `2`.
   - However, it's impossible to have scores (1, 1, 10) because the highest score a player can achieve is 6 points. Thus, the correct output should be `-1`.

The program does not correctly validate whether the given scores can be achieved through a valid set of games. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
