Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 3`, `i` is 2, `k` is 0, `r` is a[2] + k // 3`.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values or expressions as described in the initial state.
