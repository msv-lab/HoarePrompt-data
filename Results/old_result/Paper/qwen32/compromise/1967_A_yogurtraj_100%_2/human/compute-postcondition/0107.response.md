The code snippet `y = n - 1 - i` updates the value of `y` based on the current values of `n` and `i`. Given that `n` is an integer greater than 0 and `i` is 3, the output state will reflect the new value of `y` while keeping other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input, `i` is 3, `r` is `a[3] + k // 4`, `rem` is `k % 4`, `y` is `n - 4`.**
