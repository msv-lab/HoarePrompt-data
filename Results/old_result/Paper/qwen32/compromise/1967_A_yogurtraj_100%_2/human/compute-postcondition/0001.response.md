The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state of `t` and `ii` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input.**
