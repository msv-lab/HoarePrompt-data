Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is `k % 3`, `y` is `n - 3`, `i` is 2, `r` is `a[2] + k // 3`, `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
