Given the initial state and the code snippet provided, the value of `r` is being updated to `a[i + 1]`. Here, `i` is 2, so `r` will be updated to the value at index 3 of the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0 or `n - 2`, `r` is `a[3]`, `i` is 2, `k` is `k - 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`**.
