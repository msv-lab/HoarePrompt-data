The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `n` and `k` based on the input. The initial state mentioned that `n` and `k` were already defined, but this line of code will overwrite these values with new integer inputs.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0. If `k` is not equal to 0, `r` is `a[n-1] + k // n`. Otherwise, `r` is `a[n-1]`.**

In plain English: The values of `n` and `k` are now the first and second integers from the input, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
