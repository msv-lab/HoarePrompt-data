To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the relationships between the variables.

### Given Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `ii` is 0.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is defined by the formula `k - (n-1) * (a[n-1] - a[n-2])` and it is not equal to 0.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.
- `r` is defined by the formula `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
- `rem` is 0.
- `y` is 0.

### Print Statement:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `r`**:
   - `r` is calculated as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
   - Here, `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the sorted list `a`.
   - `k // n` is the integer division of `k` by `n`.

2. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - The expression to be printed is `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`.
   - Substituting `r` into the expression, we get:
     \[
     ((a[n - 1] + k // n) - 1) * n + 1 + k \% n
     \]
   - Simplifying further:
     \[
     (a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1 + k \% n
     \]
     \[
     (a[n - 1] * n + k // n * n - n) + 1 + k \% n
     \]
     \[
     a[n - 1] * n + k * n // n - n + 1 + k \% n
     \]
     \[
     a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1 + k \% n
     \]
     \[
     a[n - 1] * n + (k - n + 1) + k \% n
     \]

### Final Output:
- The final expression to be printed is `a[n - 1] * n + (k - n + 1) + k % n`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the result of the expression `a[n - 1] * n + (k - n + 1) + k % n`.

Output: **a[n - 1] * n + (k - n + 1) + k % n (where a[n - 1] is the last element of the sorted list `a`, k is the adjusted value as per the given formula, and n is the first integer from the input)**
