Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input. If (`i + 1`) * (`a[i + 1] - a[i]`) is greater than `k`, then `r` is set to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is set to `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is set to `n - 1 - i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`, `rem` is set to 0, and `y` is set to 0.**
