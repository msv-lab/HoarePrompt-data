Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` consisting of the repetition of '110' `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**
