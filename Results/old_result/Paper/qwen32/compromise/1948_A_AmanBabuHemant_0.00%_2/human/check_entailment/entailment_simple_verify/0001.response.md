### Reasoning:

1. **Character Set**: The program constructs the string using the characters '1', '1', and '0', which are not uppercase Latin letters as required by the problem statement. This is a direct violation of the problem's requirements.

2. **Special Characters Misinterpretation**: The program incorrectly assumes that special characters can only be formed using the pattern '110'. This pattern does not meet the criteria of having special characters as defined in the problem statement. A special character is one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The pattern '110' does not ensure that the resulting string will have the required number of special characters in the context of uppercase Latin letters.

3. **Odd `n` Handling**: The program correctly identifies that an odd number of special characters cannot be formed with the given pattern. However, this is not a universal rule for all possible strings. For example, the string "AAABAA" has 3 special characters, which is odd. The program's logic for handling odd `n` is based on a flawed assumption about the pattern '110', not a general rule about the impossibility of forming an odd number of special characters.

4. **String Construction**: The constructed string '110' does not meet the criteria of having special characters as defined in the problem statement. The pattern '110' does not create special characters in the context of uppercase Latin letters.

5. **General Approach**: The problem requires constructing a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly `n` special characters. The provided program does not meet this requirement due to the incorrect character set and pattern used.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the provided program, the correctness of the given program is:

**Final: False**
