The code snippet assigns the value of `ind` to `p[i]`. Given that `i` is 2 and `ind` is `n - 4`, the element at index 2 in the list `p` will now hold the value `n - 4`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 2, `p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[0]` is `n - 2`, `p[1]` is `n`, `p[2]` is `n - 4`, and all other `p[i]` for i > 2 are 0, `ind` is equal to `n - 4`, `i` is 2**.
