The code snippet `p[i] = ind` assigns the value of `ind` to the element at index `i` in the list `p`. Given the initial state, `ind` is equal to `n`, so `p[i]` will be set to `n`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `ind` remain unchanged. The list `p` will have its `i`-th element updated to `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[i]` is `n`, `ind` is equal to `n`**.
