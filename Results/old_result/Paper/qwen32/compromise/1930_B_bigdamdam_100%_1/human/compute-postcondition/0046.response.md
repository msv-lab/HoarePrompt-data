The code snippet `ind += 2` increments the value of `ind` by 2. Given the initial state, `ind` is 3 if `n` is even or 4 if `n` is odd. After the increment, `ind` will be 5 if `n` is even or 6 if `n` is odd. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 1, `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[2j] = n - 2j` for `j` such that `2j < n`, `p[3] = ind`, and all other elements are 0, `ind` is 5 if `n` is even or 6 if `n` is odd, `i` is 3**.
