The variable `ind` is assigned the value of `n`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the integer read from the input, `p` is a list of `n` elements where each element is 0, and `ind` is equal to `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the integer read from the input, `p` is a list of `n` elements where each element is 0, and `ind` is equal to `n`.**
