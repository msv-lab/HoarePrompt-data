Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[0]` is `n - 2` and `p[i]` is `n`, `ind` is equal to `n - 4`, `i` is 0**

Natural language: The value of `ind` has been decremented by 2, so `ind` is now `n - 4`. All other variables remain unchanged.
