To determine the output, we need to understand how the variable `ans` is calculated based on the provided initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t`: remains the same (not used in the provided code snippet)
- `i`: 2
- `n`: first input integer
- `m`: second input integer
- `count`: `m + 1`
- `ans`: updated based on loop iterations until `count > m`

The variable `ans` is updated in a loop that runs until `count` exceeds `m`. However, the specific loop logic is not provided in the code snippet. Given the information, we can infer that `ans` is the result of some series or calculation that depends on `n` and `m`.

### Output State:
The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(int(ans))
```

### Analysis:
Since the specific loop logic is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `ans`. The value of `ans` is the result of some computation involving `n` and `m`, and it is printed as an integer.

### Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, the output will be the integer value of `ans`, which is the result of the loop computation involving `n` and `m`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the result of the loop computation involving n and m)**
