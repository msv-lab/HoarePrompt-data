Output State: **`t` remains the same, an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `i` is 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input and `m` must be at least 2; `count` is 3; `ans` is the first integer from the input plus `g / count + 1`; `countmins` is 1; `g` is `n / 2 - countmins`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The value of `count` is incremented by 1, so `count` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
