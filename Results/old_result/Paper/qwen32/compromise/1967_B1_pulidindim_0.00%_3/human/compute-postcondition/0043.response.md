Output State: **`t` remains the same, an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `i` is 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input and `m` must be at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is the first integer from the input plus `g / count + 1`; `countmins` is 1; `g` is `n / 2 - countmins`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to be the initial value of `ans` plus the value of `g / count + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
