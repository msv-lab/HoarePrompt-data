The code snippet `ans += g / count + 1` modifies the value of `ans` by adding `g / count + 1` to it. Given the initial state, we can calculate the new value of `ans` as follows:

- `g` is `n / 3 - 2`
- `count` is 3
- `ans` is initially `n / 2 - countmins / count + 1`

The expression to be added to `ans` is `g / count + 1`, which translates to `(n / 3 - 2) / 3 + 1`. Simplifying this, we get `n / 9 - 2/3 + 1` or `n / 9 + 1/3`.

Therefore, the new value of `ans` is the old value of `ans` plus `n / 9 + 1/3`.

So, the new `ans` is:
\[ \text{new\_ans} = \left(\frac{n}{2} - \frac{\text{countmins}}{\text{count}} + 1\right) + \left(\frac{n}{9} + \frac{1}{3}\right) \]

Simplifying further:
\[ \text{new\_ans} = \frac{n}{2} - \frac{2}{3} + 1 + \frac{n}{9} + \frac{1}{3} \]
\[ \text{new\_ans} = \frac{n}{2} + \frac{n}{9} - \frac{1}{3} + 1 \]
\[ \text{new\_ans} = \frac{9n + 2n}{18} + \frac{2}{3} \]
\[ \text{new\_ans} = \frac{11n}{18} + \frac{2}{3} \]

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is at least 3, `count` is 3, `ans` is `11n/18 + 2/3`, `countmins` is 2, `g` is `n/3 - 2`.**
