Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem asks us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Mathematical Insight

The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\).

Since \(\gcd(a, b)\) divides both \(a\) and \(b\), let \(a = d \cdot x\) and \(b = d \cdot y\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). Then the condition becomes:
\[ d \cdot x + d \cdot y = k \cdot d \cdot y \cdot 1 \]
\[ x + y = k \cdot y \]
\[ x = (k - 1) \cdot y \]

Thus, \(x\) must be a multiple of \(y\) and \(k - 1\) must be a positive integer. This means for each \(b = d \cdot y\), \(a\) can take values \(a = d \cdot (k - 1) \cdot y\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\).

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the program provided:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))
```

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Initialization of `ans`**:
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. This is incorrect because it does not account for pairs where \(b = 1\).
   - For \(b = 1\), \(a\) can take any value from 1 to \(n\), contributing `n` pairs. However, the loop starts from `count = 2`, missing this case.

2. **Logic Inside the Loop**:
   - The logic inside the loop seems to be attempting to count valid pairs for each \(b > 1\).
   - The calculation `g = n / count` and subsequent operations do not correctly reflect the mathematical insight derived above.
   - The loop iterates over `count` from 2 to `m`, but the logic inside the loop does not correctly count the number of valid `a` for each `b`.

3. **Break Condition**:
   - The condition `if g < countmins: break` is not clearly justified and does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as per the problem statement. It misses the case where \(b = 1\) and incorrectly handles the counting logic for \(b > 1\).

### Correctness

**Correctness: False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly account for all valid pairs \((a, b)\) as described in the problem statement.
