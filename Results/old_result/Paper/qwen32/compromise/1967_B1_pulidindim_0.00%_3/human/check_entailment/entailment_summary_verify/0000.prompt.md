You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it takes two positive integers `n` and `m`, and computes a specific value based on these inputs. It then prints the result for each test case. The result is an integer derived from an iterative calculation involving `n` and `m`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the conditions given in the problem description. Let's analyze why it is incorrect.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The program's logic seems to be incorrect for several reasons:
1. The program starts the count at 2 and initializes `ans` to `n`, which does not align with the problem's requirement.
2. The loop and conditions inside the loop do not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs.
3. The variable `g` is calculated as `n / count`, which does not match the required logic for checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's consider a simple test case to demonstrate the issue:

#### Test Case:
```
Input:
1
2 3
```

#### Expected Output:
```
3
```
The valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).

#### Program Output:
The program does not produce the correct output for this test case.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a correct implementation:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This implementation correctly iterates through all pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the required condition, ensuring that the count is accurate for all test cases.
