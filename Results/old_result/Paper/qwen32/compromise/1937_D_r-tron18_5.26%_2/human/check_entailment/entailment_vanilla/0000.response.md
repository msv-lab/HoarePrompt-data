To determine if the given Python program correctly solves the problem, we need to analyze the logic and steps involved in the code. Let's break down the program step by step:

### Function 1: `func_1(arr, times)`
- This function calculates the difference between the last element of the array `arr` and the element at the position `max(-n, -1 - times)`.
- It seems to be used for computing differences in accumulated sums, which is useful for determining how many times certain conditions have been met.

### Function 2: `func_2(s1, n)`
- `s1` is the string of '<' and '>' characters representing the grid.
- `n` is the length of the grid.
- `pre` is a list of indices where the character is '>'. This helps in tracking positions of '>' characters.
- `totalOne` keeps track of the number of '>' characters.
- `preOne` is an accumulated sum of indices of '>' characters.
- `suffZero` is a list that accumulates indices of '<' characters, starting from the end of the string.
- `ans` is the list that will store the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

### Main Logic:
- The code iterates over the string `s1` from right to left.
- For each character, it checks if it is '>' or '<'.
- If it is '>', it calculates the number of seconds based on the accumulated sums of '>' and '<' characters.
- If it is '<', it updates the accumulated sum of '<' characters and then calculates the number of seconds based on the accumulated sums.
- The calculations involve complex manipulations of the accumulated sums to determine the exact number of moves required for the pinball to exit the grid.

### Verification:
- The program uses accumulated sums to efficiently calculate the number of moves. This is crucial given the constraints (up to 500,000 characters in the grid).
- The logic for handling '<' and '>' characters and updating the accumulated sums seems consistent with the problem requirements.
- The output format matches the problem description, where the number of seconds for each starting position is printed.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It efficiently handles the large input sizes and constraints using accumulated sums and careful index manipulations.

Correctness: **True**
