Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by using a combination of prefix and suffix sums, but it does not correctly simulate the movement and inversion of the pinball and grid characters as described in the problem statement. The logic for calculating the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid is flawed, and the program does not accurately reflect the pinball's behavior according to the rules given.

The main issues with the program are:
1. It does not correctly simulate the pinball's movement and the inversion of the characters in the grid.
2. The use of prefix and suffix sums does not properly account for the changes in the grid as the pinball moves.
3. The logic for determining the number of seconds is incorrect and does not match the problem's requirements.

A correct solution would need to simulate the pinball's movement for each starting position, keeping track of the changes in the grid and the pinball's position until it leaves the grid. This would likely involve a more straightforward simulation approach rather than using prefix and suffix sums.
