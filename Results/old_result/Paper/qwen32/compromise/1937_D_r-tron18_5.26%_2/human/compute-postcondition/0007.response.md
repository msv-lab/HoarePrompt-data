To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, we need to understand the context and the calculations involved in determining the values of the variables `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, and `ans`.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **String `s1`**: A string consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
2. **Integer `n`**: The length of the string `s1`.
3. **List `pre`**: A list of 1-based indices where the character '>' appears in `s1`.
4. **Integer `totalOne`**: Initialized to 0. It likely counts the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
5. **List `preOne`**: An empty list that will store cumulative sums of the count of '>' characters up to each index.
6. **List `suffZero`**: A list containing cumulative sums of indices for '<' characters.
7. **List `ans`**: A list of `n` integers calculated based on specific loop conditions.

### Calculation Steps:

1. **Determine `pre`**:
   - Iterate through `s1` and collect the 1-based indices of '>' characters.

2. **Calculate `totalOne`**:
   - Count the number of '>' characters in `s1` and store it in `totalOne`.

3. **Build `preOne`**:
   - Create a cumulative sum list of the count of '>' characters up to each index.
   - For example, if `s1` is ">>><<", `preOne` would be `[1, 2, 3, 3, 3]` because there are three '>' characters at the beginning.

4. **Build `suffZero`**:
   - Create a cumulative sum list of indices for '<' characters.
   - For example, if `s1` is ">>><<", `suffZero` would be `[0, 0, 0, 1, 3]` because '<' characters appear at indices 3 and 4 (0-based).

5. **Calculate `ans`**:
   - The list `ans` is calculated based on the loop conditions, which typically involve using `preOne` and `suffZero` to determine the number of '<' characters to the right and '>' characters to the left for each position in `s1`.
   - For example, if `s1` is ">>><<", `ans` might be calculated as `[2, 1, 0, 2, 1]` based on the number of '>' to the left and '<' to the right for each position.

### Output Explanation:

Given the initial state and the calculations, the `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list separated by spaces.

Since the exact string `s1` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated values of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is a list of n integers calculated based on the loop conditions involving preOne and suffZero)**
