You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

    #State: the results of each test case printed sequentially.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific result based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the sorted list `a`. The result is derived by determining how `k` can be distributed among the elements of `a` to achieve a certain condition, and then computing a final value that reflects this distribution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it against the problem description. The goal is to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Logic for Distributing Coins**: The current logic attempts to distribute the coins `k` such that the smallest `i` cards are incremented up to the next level. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting distribution will maximize the number of valid permutations.

2. **Handling Remaining Coins**: After distributing the coins to make the counts of the first few card types equal, the remaining coins are not optimally distributed among the remaining card types.

3. **Final Calculation**: The final calculation `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y` seems incorrect. It does not properly account for the number of valid permutations after distributing the coins.

### Potential Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 4
1 1 1
```
Here, `n = 3` and `k = 4`. We start with 1 card of each type `[1, 1, 1]`. The optimal strategy would be to distribute the 4 coins to make the counts `[2, 2, 2]`, which allows for the maximum number of valid permutations.

However, the provided program might not handle this case correctly. Let's see how the program executes with this input:

- Initially, `a = [1, 1, 1]`.
- The loop will check if `(1 + 1) * (1 - 1) > 4` (which is false).
- Then it will check if `(2 + 1) * (1 - 1) > 4` (which is also false).
- Finally, it will set `r = 1 + 4 // 3 = 2` and `rem = 4 % 3 = 1`.
- The final print statement will compute `(2 - 1) * 3 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 5`.

This result is incorrect because the correct answer should be `6` (by making the counts `[2, 2, 2]`).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle the distribution of coins to maximize the number of valid permutations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
