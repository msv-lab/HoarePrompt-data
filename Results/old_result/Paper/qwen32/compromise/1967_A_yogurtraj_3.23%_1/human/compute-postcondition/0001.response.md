The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and `input()` returns `t`. However, the code does not use `t` directly and instead reads new values for `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input.**
