Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2
- `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input
- `i` is `i + 1`

Code Snippet:
```python
r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
```

From the code snippet, we can see that `r` is being assigned a new value which is the sum of `a[i]` and `k // (i + 1)`. Here, `k` is not defined in the initial state, so we'll keep it as `k` in our output state.

Since `i` was already incremented by 1 in the initial state, we can use the current value of `i` directly in the calculation. 

Therefore, the output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`**

This means that `r` now holds the value calculated from the elements of `a` at index `i` and the integer division of `k` by `(i + 1)`. All other variables retain their previous states.
