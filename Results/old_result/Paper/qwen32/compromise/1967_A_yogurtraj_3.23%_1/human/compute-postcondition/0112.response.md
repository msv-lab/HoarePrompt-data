Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ii` retains its previous value, `i` is `i + 1`. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` is set to 0, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is adjusted to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is `a[i + 1]`, and `rem` and `y` are adjusted based on the condition.**
