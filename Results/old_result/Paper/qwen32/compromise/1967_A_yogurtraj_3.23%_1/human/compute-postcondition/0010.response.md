The code snippet calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `(i + 1)` and assigns it to the variable `rem`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, or `y`. The condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` remains unchanged as well.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is 0, and `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`.**
