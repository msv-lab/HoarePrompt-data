The code assigns the value of `k % (i + 1)` to the variable `rem`. This calculation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, or `r`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the new variable `rem`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`**.
