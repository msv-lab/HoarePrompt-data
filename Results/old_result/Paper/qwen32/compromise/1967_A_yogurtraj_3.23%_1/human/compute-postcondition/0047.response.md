The code snippet `r = a[0]` assigns the value of the first element of the sorted list `a` to the variable `r`. This means that the previous value of `r` (which was `a[n - 1] + k // n` or `a[n - 1]` depending on the value of `k`) is replaced by `a[0]`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `r` is `a[0]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is the current value of `ii` plus 1, `a` is the sorted list of integers read from the input.**
