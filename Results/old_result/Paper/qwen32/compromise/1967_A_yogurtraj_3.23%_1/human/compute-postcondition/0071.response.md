The code snippet `r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)` updates the value of `r` based on the current values of `a[i]`, `k`, and `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is greater than 1
- `k` is either 0 or `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`
- `r` is either `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` or `a[i + 1]`
- `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` or 0
- `y` is either `n - 1 - i` or 0
- `ii` is the current value of `ii` plus 1
- `a` is the sorted list of integers read from the input
- `i` is the current value of `i` plus 2

After executing the code snippet, the new value of `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is either 0 or `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` or 0, `y` is either `n - 1 - i` or 0, `ii` is the current value of `ii` plus 1, `a` is the sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 2**.
