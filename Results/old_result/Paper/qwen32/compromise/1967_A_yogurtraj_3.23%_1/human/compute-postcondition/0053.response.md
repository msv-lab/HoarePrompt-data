The code snippet assigns the value of `k % (i + 1)` to the variable `rem`. This means `rem` now holds the remainder of the division of `k` by `i + 1`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `rem`. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is 0, `ii` is the current value of `ii` plus 1, `a` is the sorted list of integers read from the input, and `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`.**
