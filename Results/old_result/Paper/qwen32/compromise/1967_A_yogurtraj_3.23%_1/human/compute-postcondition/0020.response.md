Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`**

Explanation: The value of `rem` is now calculated as `k % (i + 1)`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
