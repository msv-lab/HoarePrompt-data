To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop logic and how it progresses through each iteration.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2` (since `range(0, n - 1)`).
- For each iteration `i`, it checks if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`.
- If true, it updates `r`, `rem`, `y`, and sets `k` to 0, then breaks out of the loop.
- If false, it updates `k` and `r`, and continues to the next iteration.

### Given Conditions:
- Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `r` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0.
- After 3 iterations, the loop either breaks or continues based on the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`.

### Final Output State:
The loop will continue until one of the following happens:
1. `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`: In this case, the loop breaks, and `r`, `rem`, `y`, and `k` are updated accordingly.
2. The loop completes all iterations without breaking: In this case, `k` will be reduced by the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 2`.

Let's consider both scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Loop Breaks
If the loop breaks during any iteration `i`, the output state will be:
- `r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)`
- `rem = k % (i + 1)`
- `y = n - 1 - i`
- `k = 0`

#### Scenario 2: Loop Completes All Iterations
If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, the output state will be:
- `r = a[n - 1]` (since `r` is updated to `a[i + 1]` in each iteration and the last valid `i` is `n - 2`)
- `rem = 0`
- `y = 0`
- `k = k - sum((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) for i in range(n - 1))`

Since the problem does not specify whether the loop breaks or completes all iterations, we need to consider both possibilities. However, the most general and final state assuming no early termination would be when the loop completes all iterations.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is updated to `k - sum((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) for i in range(n - 1))`, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `r` is `a[n - 1]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0.**

In natural language: The final output state is that `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is reduced by the total difference accumulated over all iterations, `a` remains unchanged, `r` is set to the last element of the sorted list `a`, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 0.
