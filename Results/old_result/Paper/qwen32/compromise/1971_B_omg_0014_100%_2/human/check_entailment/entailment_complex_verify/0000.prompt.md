You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: the values of `t`, `n`, and the initial state of `s` remain unchanged. The output consists of printed lines for each test case based on the conditions described in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` and prints 'NO' if all characters in `s` are the same, otherwise it prints 'YES' and then prints the lexicographically smallest string if `s` is not already sorted, or the lexicographically largest string if `s` is sorted.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes a string `s` and checks if it's possible to rearrange the characters to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`. If all characters in `s` are the same, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" and provides one possible rearrangement.

Here is the provided code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
```

### Correctness Check

1. **Handling Strings with All Identical Characters:**
   - If all characters in `s` are the same, the set `a` will have a length of 1. The program correctly prints "NO" in this case.
   
2. **Handling Strings with Different Characters:**
   - If `s` contains different characters, the program attempts to rearrange the string by sorting it in ascending and descending order.
   - It checks if the sorted string `b` is equal to `s`. If it is, it prints the reverse sorted string `c`. Otherwise, it prints `b`.
   - This approach ensures that the rearranged string is different from the original string `s` because sorting (either ascending or descending) will produce a string that is not equal to the original string if the original string contains different characters.

### Edge Cases

- **Strings of Length 1:**
  - A string of length 1 will always have all identical characters, so it should correctly print "NO".
  
- **Strings with Two or More Different Characters:**
  - The program should correctly rearrange the string by sorting it. If the original string is already sorted in ascending order, the program will print the descending order, ensuring that the new string is different from the original.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly handles all the cases mentioned in the problem description. It ensures that if a rearrangement is possible, it provides a valid rearranged string that is different from the original. If rearrangement is not possible (i.e., all characters are the same), it correctly reports "NO".

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
