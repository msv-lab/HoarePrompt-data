### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the game mechanics and the provided solution.

The game revolves around the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins ('U'). Here's a breakdown of the game dynamics:

1. **Game Dynamics:**
   - Each move involves selecting a facing-up coin ('U'), removing it, and flipping the two adjacent coins.
   - If only two coins remain, removing one will leave the other unchanged (since it would be flipped twice).
   - If only one coin remains, no further flips occur.
   - The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins ('U') left.

2. **Strategic Implications:**
   - The number of facing-up coins ('U') is crucial because the player who is forced to play when there are no 'U' coins loses.
   - The parity of the number of 'U' coins determines the winner:
     - If the number of 'U' coins is odd, the first player (Alice) can always force a win by playing optimally.
     - If the number of 'U' coins is even, the second player (Bob) can always force a win by playing optimally.

3. **Solution Analysis:**
   - The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of 'U' coins.
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of 'U' coins in the string `s` and returns 'YES' if the count is odd and 'NO' if the count is even.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins, which aligns with the game's strategic implications. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Your response:
Correctness: **True**
