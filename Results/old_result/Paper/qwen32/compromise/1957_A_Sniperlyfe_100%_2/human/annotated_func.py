#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases, followed by t pairs of lines. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `freq` is a dictionary where each unique integer in `arr` is a key, and the value is the number of times that integer appears in `arr`.
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the dictionary `freq` by 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` as input, where the first integer `t` indicates the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing the lengths of sticks. The function calculates and returns the sum of how many complete sets of three sticks can be formed from each unique stick length across all test cases.
