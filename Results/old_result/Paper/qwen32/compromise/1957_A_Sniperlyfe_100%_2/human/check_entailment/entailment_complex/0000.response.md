Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The task is to determine the maximum number of regular (equal-sided) polygons that can be formed from the available sticks, where each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick and no stick is used in more than one polygon. 

In the provided code, the function `func_1` calculates the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each stick length by 3, which essentially counts the number of complete sets of three sticks of the same length. However, this is not sufficient to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed. 

For example, if there are 4 sticks of length 3, the function will return 1 (since 4 // 3 = 1), indicating that one triangle can be formed. However, a square can be formed with 4 sticks of the same length, so the correct answer should be 1 square instead of 1 triangle.

The correct approach would involve checking for the maximum number of polygons that can be formed for each possible number of sides (from 3 upwards) and keeping track of the maximum number of polygons that can be formed across all stick lengths.

Correctness: **False**
