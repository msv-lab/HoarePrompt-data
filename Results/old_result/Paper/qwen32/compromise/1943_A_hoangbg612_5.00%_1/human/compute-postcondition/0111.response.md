The only variable in the loop head is `num`, and it depends on the list `N`. For the loop to execute, `N` must have at least one integer. The variables `M`, `S`, and `cur` are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `N` contains at least one integer. The values of `M`, `S`, and `cur` can remain as they are.

State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `M` is an empty dictionary, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is -1**
