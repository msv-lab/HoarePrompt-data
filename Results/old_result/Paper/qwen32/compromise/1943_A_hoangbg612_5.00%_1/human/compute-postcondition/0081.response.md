Postcondition: **`M` is a dictionary, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least two elements, `cur` is either -1, 0, or the value of `num` if `num > cur`, and `num` is the next element in `N` (i.e., `num_next`). If `num > cur + 1`, `cur` is set to `cur + 1` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.**
