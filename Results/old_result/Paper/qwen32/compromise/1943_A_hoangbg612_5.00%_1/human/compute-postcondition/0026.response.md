The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `N`. If there are more elements in `N`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the last element assigned from `N`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `N` to be assigned to `num`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `num` is `num_next`, which is the next element in the list `N`. After the loop completes an iteration, `num` will be updated to the next element in `N`. Therefore, for the next iteration, `num` should be the subsequent element in `N` after `num_next`.

State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` < `n`, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 2 elements; `num` is the next element in the list `N` after `num_next`. If `num` > `cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num` and `M[cur]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**
