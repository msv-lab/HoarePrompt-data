Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers, `M` is a dictionary with keys as numbers from `N` (or up to the last number before a gap) and values as the count of consecutive occurrences, `S` is an input integer (unchanged), `cur` is the last number processed in `N` (or the last number before a gap) incremented by 1. The sum of the values in `M` equals `S`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `cur` has been increased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
