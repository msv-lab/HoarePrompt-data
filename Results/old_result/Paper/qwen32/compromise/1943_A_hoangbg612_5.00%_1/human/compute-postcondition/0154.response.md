Postcondition: **`N` is a sorted list of integers, `M` is a dictionary with keys as numbers from `N` (or up to the last number before a gap) and values as the count of consecutive occurrences, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is `x + 1`, and `i` is `x + 2`. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `cur`, and `i`.**
