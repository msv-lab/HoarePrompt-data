The code snippet provided is just a `break` statement, which means it will exit the most internal loop or if statement. Given the initial state, the values of `M`, `S`, `N`, `cur`, and `num` will not be changed by this `break` statement. The `break` statement does not modify any variables; it only alters the control flow by exiting the loop or if statement.

Output State: **`M` is a dictionary, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least two elements, `cur` is `cur + 1`, and `num` is the next element in `N` (i.e., `num_next`). The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
