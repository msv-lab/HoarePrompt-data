The code snippet `M[cur] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. The variable `cur` is specified to be equal to `num`, and `num` is defined as the next integer in the list `N`. The list `N` is sorted and contains at least one integer. The variable `S` is an input integer, but it is not used in the given code snippet.

Since the value of `cur` is `num` and `num` is the next integer in the list `N`, the dictionary `M` will have the key `num` with the value `1`.

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is now equal to `num`, and `num` is the next integer in the list `N`. The dictionary `M` has the key `num` with the value `1`.**
