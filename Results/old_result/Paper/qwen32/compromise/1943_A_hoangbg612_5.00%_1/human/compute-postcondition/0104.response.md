To determine what will be printed by the `print(cur)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state:

- `M` is a dictionary where keys are unique elements of the list `N` and values are their respective counts in `N`.
- `S` remains unchanged (though it's not used in the given code snippet).
- `N` remains unchanged.
- `cur` is defined as the smallest `i` such that `M[i] <= i`.

Let's break down the process step by step:

1. **Understanding `M`**:
   - `M` is a dictionary with keys that are unique elements from the list `N`.
   - The values in `M` represent the count of each unique element in `N`.

2. **Understanding `cur`**:
   - `cur` is the smallest `i` for which the condition `M[i] <= i` holds true.
   - This means we need to find the smallest key `i` in `M` such that the count of `i` in `N` (which is `M[i]`) is less than or equal to `i`.

3. **Determining `cur`**:
   - To find `cur`, we need to iterate through the keys of `M` and check the condition `M[i] <= i`.
   - The first key that satisfies this condition is assigned to `cur`.

Since the exact contents of `N` and `M` are not provided, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `cur`. However, we can describe the value of `cur` based on the given conditions.

**Output Explanation**:
The `print(cur)` statement will print the smallest key `i` in the dictionary `M` such that the count of `i` in `N` (which is `M[i]`) is less than or equal to `i`.

Thus, the final output is:
Output: **cur (where cur is the smallest key i in M such that M[i] <= i)**
