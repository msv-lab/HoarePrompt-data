Postcondition: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is either `cur + 1` if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, or remains unchanged otherwise, and `num` is the next integer in the list `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, the loop or if statement is broken out of.**
