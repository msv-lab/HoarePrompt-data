The given code attempts to increment the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M` by 1. However, since `cur` is initialized to -1 and there is no initial entry for -1 in `M`, this operation will raise a `KeyError` because `M[cur]` does not exist yet. To properly handle this, one would typically initialize the key with a default value (e.g., 0) before incrementing it.

Given the task constraints and the code provided, the code as written will not execute successfully without modification. However, if we assume the code is intended to work and `M[cur]` is supposed to be initialized to 0 before this operation, we can simulate the state after this hypothetical initialization and increment.

Assuming `M[cur]` is initialized to 0 before the increment operation:
- `M[-1]` would be set to 0.
- Then, `M[-1]` would be incremented by 1, making `M[-1]` equal to 1.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` < `n`, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element; `cur` is -1; `M` is a dictionary with `M[-1]` equal to 1; `num` is less than or equal to `cur`**.
