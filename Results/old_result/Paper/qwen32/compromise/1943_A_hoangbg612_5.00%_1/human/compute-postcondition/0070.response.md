The only variables in the loop head are `num` and `N`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `N` and the variable `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the last element of `N`. For the loop to execute again, `N` must have at least one more element, and `num` will be the next element in `N`.

Let's assume the last `num` was the `k`-th element of `N`. For the next iteration, `num` should be the `(k+1)`-th element of `N`.

State: **`M` is a dictionary, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least two elements, `cur` is either -1 or 0, and `num` is the next element in `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, `M` contains `cur` as the key with a value of 1. Otherwise, `M` contains the entry {-1: 1} and `cur` remains -1.**

To be more specific, let's denote the next element in `N` as `num_next`.

State: **`M` is a dictionary, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least two elements, `cur` is either -1 or 0, and `num` is `num_next`, the next element in `N`. If `num_next` is greater than `cur`, `M` contains `cur` as the key with a value of 1. Otherwise, `M` contains the entry {-1: 1} and `cur` remains -1.**

Since we are only adjusting `num` and `N` and we know `N` must have at least two elements, we can simplify it to:

State: **`M` is a dictionary, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least two elements, `cur` is either -1 or 0, and `num` is the next element in `N`.**

This captures all the necessary adjustments for the next iteration of the loop.
