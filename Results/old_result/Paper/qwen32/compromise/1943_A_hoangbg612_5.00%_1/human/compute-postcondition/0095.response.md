The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `cur`. If `i` is less than `cur`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was some value, and the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `cur`. To execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, provided that `i` is still less than `cur`.

State: **`M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements of `N` and values as their respective counts in `N`, `S` remains unchanged, `N` remains unchanged, and the last element in `N` is at least 1. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, then `cur` is set to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the condition `M[i] > i` holds and no change is made to `cur`. `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration.**

Since the state of `i` is the only one that can be adjusted and it needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, we adjust `i` accordingly.

State: **`M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements of `N` and values as their respective counts in `N`, `S` remains unchanged, `N` remains unchanged, and the last element in `N` is at least 1. `i` is incremented by 1.**
