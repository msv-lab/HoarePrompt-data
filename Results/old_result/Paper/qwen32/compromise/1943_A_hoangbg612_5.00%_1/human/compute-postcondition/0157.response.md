To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, let's break down the provided code and the loop's behavior:

1. **Loop Structure**: The outer loop runs `T` times, where `T` is the number of test cases.
2. **Inner Logic**:
   - `S` is read as an integer input.
   - `N` is read as a list of integers, then sorted.
   - `cur` is initialized to `-1`.
   - `M` is a dictionary that will store the count of each number in `N` up to the point where a gap is found.
   - The loop iterates through each number in `N`:
     - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`:
       - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, a gap is found, and `cur` is incremented by 1, breaking the loop.
       - Otherwise, `cur` is updated to `num`, and `M[num]` is set to 1.
     - If `num` is not greater than `cur`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.
   - After the loop, if the sum of the counts in `M` equals `S`, `cur` is incremented by 1.
   - Finally, the code finds the smallest `i` in the range `[0, cur-1]` such that `M[i] <= i`. If no such `i` exists, `cur` remains unchanged.
   - The result (`cur`) is printed.

Given the loop's behavior, the output state after all the iterations is determined by the final value of `cur` for each test case. 

### Final Output State
The output state after all the iterations is the final value of `cur` for each test case. This value is printed after processing each test case.

Output State: **The final value of `cur` for each test case, printed sequentially for each of the `T` test cases.**

In natural language, after all the iterations, the output state is the final value of `cur` for each test case, which is printed one by one for each of the `T` test cases. This value is determined by the logic of finding the smallest `i` such that `M[i] <= i` or incrementing `cur` based on the sum of counts in `M` compared to `S`.
