In the provided `for` loop, the loop head only contains the variable `_`, which is a throwaway variable indicating the number of iterations to be performed. The loop variable `_` does not affect the loop's execution condition, as the loop will simply run `T` times regardless of the value of `_`.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration does not need to change with respect to the loop variable `_`. However, the state description provided includes `cur` and the array `M`, which are not part of the loop head but are mentioned in the state description. Since we are only allowed to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we do not modify `cur` or `M`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration, with respect to the loop variable `_`.

State: **The smallest `i` in the range `[0, cur-1]` such that `M[i] <= i`, or `cur` if no such `i` exists.**
