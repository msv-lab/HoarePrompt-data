The code snippet `cur = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `cur`. The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers, `M` is a dictionary with keys as numbers from `N` (or up to the last number before a gap) and values as the count of consecutive occurrences, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is `x + 2`, `i` is `x + 2`.**
