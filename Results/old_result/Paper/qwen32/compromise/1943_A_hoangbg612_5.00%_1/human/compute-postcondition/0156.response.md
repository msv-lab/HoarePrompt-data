To determine what will be printed by the `print(cur)` statement, let's break down the given initial state:

1. **N**: A sorted list of integers.
2. **M**: A dictionary where keys are numbers from `N` (or up to the last number before a gap) and values are the count of consecutive occurrences of those numbers in `N`.
3. **S**: An input integer (though `S` is not used in the `print(cur)` statement).
4. **cur**: The smallest `i` where `M[i] <= i`, or the initial value of `cur` if no such `i` is found.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **List `N`**: Since `N` is a sorted list of integers, we can assume it contains some integers in ascending order. For example, `N = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]`.
2. **Dictionary `M`**: The dictionary `M` will have keys as unique numbers from `N` and values as their respective counts. For the example `N`, `M` would be `{1: 2, 2: 3, 3: 1, 4: 2}`.
3. **Variable `cur`**: The variable `cur` is defined as the smallest `i` where `M[i] <= i`. If no such `i` exists, `cur` retains its initial value (which is not explicitly defined in the problem statement, but we can infer it to be a reasonable starting point, like the first element of `N` or 0).

### Determining `cur`

Let's walk through the example to determine `cur`:

- For `i = 1`, `M[1] = 2`, which is not less than or equal to `1`.
- For `i = 2`, `M[2] = 3`, which is not less than or equal to `2`.
- For `i = 3`, `M[3] = 1`, which is less than or equal to `3`.

Thus, the smallest `i` where `M[i] <= i` is `3`. Therefore, `cur` is `3`.

### Output

Based on the above analysis, the `print(cur)` statement will output the value of `cur`, which we have determined to be `3` in this example.

However, since the exact list `N` and the initial value of `cur` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given conditions.

Output: **cur (where cur is the smallest i such that M[i] <= i, or the initial value of cur if no such i is found)**
