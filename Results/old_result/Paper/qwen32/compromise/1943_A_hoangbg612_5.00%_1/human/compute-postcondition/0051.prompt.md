Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur` is the highest number in `N` that is consecutively reachable starting from -1. If the sum of the counts of all values in `M` is equal to `S`, then `cur` is incremented by 1. `M` contains the count of each such reachable value.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cur):
    if M[i] <= i:
        cur = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cur` must be greater than 0. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, then `cur` is set to `i` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cur` is equal to the incremented value of `i` if `M[i] <= i`. Otherwise, `cur` retains its value and `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is incremented by 1. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, `cur` is set to `i` incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no further changes are made to `cur`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
