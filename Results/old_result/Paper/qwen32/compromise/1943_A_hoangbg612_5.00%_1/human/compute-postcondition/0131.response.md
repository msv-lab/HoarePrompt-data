The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`N`, `S`, `num`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is now `cur + 1`, `num` is the next integer in the list `N`.

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is now `cur + 1`, `num` is the next integer in the list `N`.**
