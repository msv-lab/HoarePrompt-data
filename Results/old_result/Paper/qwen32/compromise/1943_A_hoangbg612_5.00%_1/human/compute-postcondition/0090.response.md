To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(cur):`, so we need to ensure that `cur` is set appropriately.

Let's break down the conditions given in the problem statement:

1. `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements of `N` and values as their respective counts in `N`.
2. `S` remains unchanged.
3. `N` remains unchanged.
4. If the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`, then `cur` is the last element in `N` plus 1.
5. Otherwise, `cur` remains the last element in `N`.

The loop will execute if `cur` is greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `cur` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute. This means `cur` should be at least 1.

Let's consider the two possible scenarios for `cur`:

- If the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`, then `cur` is set to the last element in `N` plus 1. To ensure the loop executes, the last element in `N` must be at least 0 (so that `cur` is at least 1).
- If the sum of the values in `M` does not equal `S`, then `cur` is set to the last element in `N`. To ensure the loop executes, the last element in `N` must be at least 1.

Given these conditions, we can set the state such that `cur` is guaranteed to be at least 1.

State: **`M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements of `N` and values as their respective counts in `N`, `S` remains unchanged, `N` remains unchanged, and the last element in `N` is at least 1**.

This ensures that `cur` will be at least 1, allowing the loop to execute.
