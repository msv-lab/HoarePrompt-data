The code snippet `M[cur] += 1` increments the value at the index `cur` in the list `M` by 1. Given the initial state, `cur` can either be -1 or equal to the previous `num`.

If `cur` is -1, the operation `M[cur] += 1` would result in an `IndexError` because -1 is not a valid index to increment in a list unless the list has at least one element and -1 refers to the last element. However, based on the problem statement and typical assumptions, we will consider the case where `cur` is equal to the previous `num`.

Therefore, the value at index `cur` in `M` is incremented by 1. The values of `N`, `S`, `cur`, and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is either -1 or equal to the previous `num`, `num` is the next integer in the list `N` after the previous `num`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**
