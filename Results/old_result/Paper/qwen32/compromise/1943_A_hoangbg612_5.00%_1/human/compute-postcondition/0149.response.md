Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers, `M` is a dictionary with keys as numbers from `N` (or up to the last number before a gap) and values as the count of consecutive occurrences, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is `x + 1`, `i` is `x + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `cur`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only impact of the code is that it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
