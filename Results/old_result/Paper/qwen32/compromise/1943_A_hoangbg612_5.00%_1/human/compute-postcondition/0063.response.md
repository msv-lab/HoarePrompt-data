The code provided is a `break` statement, which will terminate the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in. However, since there is no loop or conditional block explicitly mentioned in the provided context, the `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `M`, `S`, `N`, `cur`, or `num`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`M` is an empty dictionary; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `cur` is 0; the current value of `num` is greater than `cur + 1`.**
