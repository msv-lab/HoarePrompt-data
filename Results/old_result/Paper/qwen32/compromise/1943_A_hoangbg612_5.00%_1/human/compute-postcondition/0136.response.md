Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is either -1, equal to the previous `num`, or updated to `num - 1` if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `num` is the next integer in the list `N`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value at index `cur` in the list `M` has been increased by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
