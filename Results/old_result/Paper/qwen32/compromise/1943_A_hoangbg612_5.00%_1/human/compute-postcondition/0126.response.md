The code snippet assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. Therefore, `cur` now holds the same value as `num`. The other conditions and states mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged unless `num` causes `cur` to be updated to `num - 1` in subsequent checks, which is not part of the current code snippet.

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is equal to `num`, `num` is the next integer in the list `N` after the previous `num`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, then `cur` is updated to `num - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.**
