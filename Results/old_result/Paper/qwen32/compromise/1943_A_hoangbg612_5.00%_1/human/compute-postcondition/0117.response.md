The code snippet `cur = num` sets the value of `cur` to the value of `num`. Given that `num` is an integer greater than `cur`, `cur` will now hold the value of `num`. The other variables (`N`, `M`, `S`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `M` is an empty dictionary, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is now equal to `num`, and `num` is an integer greater than `cur` (previously).** 

In simpler terms: `cur` has been updated to the value of `num`, while the other variables retain their initial states.
