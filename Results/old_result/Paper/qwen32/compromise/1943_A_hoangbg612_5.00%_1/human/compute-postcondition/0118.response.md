The code snippet `M[cur] = 1` adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary `M` where the key is `cur` and the value is `1`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `M` is a dictionary with the key `cur` and value `1`, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is now equal to `num`, and `num` is an integer greater than `cur` (previously).** 

In simpler terms, the dictionary `M` now contains a new entry with `cur` as the key and `1` as the value. All other variables retain their initial states.
