You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        cur = -1
        M = {}
        for num in N:
            if num > cur:
                if num > cur + 1:
                    cur += 1
                    break
                cur = num
                M[cur] = 1
            else:
                M[cur] += 1
        if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
            cur += 1
        for i in range(cur):
            if M[i] <= i:
                cur = i
                break
        print(cur)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints an integer `cur` that represents the smallest integer such that the number of occurrences of each integer from 0 to `cur-1` in the list `a` is at least as large as the integer itself. If the sum of occurrences of integers in `a` matches another given integer `S`, it adjusts `cur` accordingly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts with an empty array `c`.
- Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first.
- Alice picks an element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and deletes it from `a`.
- Bob picks an element from `a` and deletes it from `a`.
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- The score of the game is the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c`.
- Alice wants to maximize the score, and Bob wants to minimize it.
- Both players play optimally.

### Analysis of the Program:
The provided program attempts to determine the final score by simulating the game and calculating the MEX of the resulting array `c`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The array `a` is sorted.

3. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `cur` to `-1` and an empty dictionary `M`.
   - It iterates through the sorted array `a` and updates `cur` to the next smallest integer that is not already in `M`.
   - If the current number in the sorted array is greater than `cur + 1`, it breaks out of the loop, indicating that `cur + 1` is the MEX.
   - If the sum of the counts in `M` equals `n`, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - Finally, it checks if any integer `i` in the range `[0, cur)` has a count in `M` that is less than or equal to `i`. If so, it updates `cur` to `i`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final value of `cur`, which is the MEX of the array `c`.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The program does not explicitly simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. It directly calculates the MEX based on the sorted array.
   - The logic assumes that the sorted array directly gives the MEX, which may not be the case if Alice and Bob play optimally.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the array `a` contains duplicate elements or when the array is already in a specific order that affects the MEX.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider a counterexample to illustrate the potential issue:

**Input:**
```
1
4
0 1 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
- Alice can pick `2`, then Bob picks `0`, Alice picks `1`, and Bob picks `1`.
- The resulting array `c` is `[2, 1, 1]`, and the MEX is `0`.

**Program Output:**
- The program will sort the array to `[0, 1, 1, 2]`.
- It will set `cur` to `0`, then `1`, and finally `2`, but it will not correctly account for the optimal play of Alice and Bob.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly simulate the game and does not account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. It directly calculates the MEX based on the sorted array, which may not be the MEX of the array `c` after optimal play.

**Correctness: False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly simulate the game where Alice and Bob play optimally. It directly calculates the MEX based on the sorted array, which may not reflect the optimal play scenario.
