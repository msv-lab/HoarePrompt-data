Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts with an empty array `c`.
- Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first.
- Alice picks an element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and deletes it from `a`.
- Bob picks an element from `a` and deletes it from `a`.
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- The score of the game is the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c`.
- Alice wants to maximize the score, and Bob wants to minimize it.
- Both players play optimally.

### Analysis of the Program:
The provided program attempts to determine the final score by simulating the game and calculating the MEX of the resulting array `c`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The array `a` is sorted.

3. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `cur` to `-1` and an empty dictionary `M`.
   - It iterates through the sorted array `a` and updates `cur` to the next smallest integer that is not already in `M`.
   - If the current number in the sorted array is greater than `cur + 1`, it breaks out of the loop, indicating that `cur + 1` is the MEX.
   - If the sum of the counts in `M` equals `n`, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - Finally, it checks if any integer `i` in the range `[0, cur)` has a count in `M` that is less than or equal to `i`. If so, it updates `cur` to `i`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final value of `cur`, which is the MEX of the array `c`.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The program does not explicitly simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. It directly calculates the MEX based on the sorted array.
   - The logic assumes that the sorted array directly gives the MEX, which may not be the case if Alice and Bob play optimally.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the array `a` contains duplicate elements or when the array is already in a specific order that affects the MEX.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider a counterexample to illustrate the potential issue:

**Input:**
```
1
4
0 1 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
- Alice can pick `2`, then Bob picks `0`, Alice picks `1`, and Bob picks `1`.
- The resulting array `c` is `[2, 1, 1]`, and the MEX is `0`.

**Program Output:**
- The program will sort the array to `[0, 1, 1, 2]`.
- It will set `cur` to `0`, then `1`, and finally `2`, but it will not correctly account for the optimal play of Alice and Bob.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly simulate the game and does not account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. It directly calculates the MEX based on the sorted array, which may not be the MEX of the array `c` after optimal play.

**Correctness: False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly simulate the game where Alice and Bob play optimally. It directly calculates the MEX based on the sorted array, which may not reflect the optimal play scenario.
