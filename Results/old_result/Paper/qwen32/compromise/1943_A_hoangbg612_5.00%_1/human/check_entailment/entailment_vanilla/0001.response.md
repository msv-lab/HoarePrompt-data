To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it step by step against the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Alice and Bob play a game where Alice aims to maximize the MEX of the array `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it.
2. **Game Rules**: Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a` and appending them to `c` until `a` is empty. Alice starts first.
3. **MEX Definition**: The smallest non-negative integer not present in the array `c`.

### Strategy:
1. **Alice's Goal**: To maximize the MEX, Alice should try to include as many smaller numbers as possible in `c`, especially the smallest ones.
2. **Bob's Goal**: To minimize the MEX, Bob should try to prevent Alice from including smaller numbers, thereby forcing Alice to pick larger numbers.

### Optimal Strategy:
- **Alice's Optimal Move**: Alice should pick the smallest available number on her turn.
- **Bob's Optimal Move**: Bob should pick the smallest available number on his turn to prevent Alice from filling gaps in the sequence of numbers in `c`.

### Program Analysis:
Let's go through the program to see if it correctly implements the optimal strategy and computes the MEX.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The array `N` is sorted to facilitate the process of picking the smallest available number.

3. **Tracking Counts**:
   - A dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the count of each number in `N`.
   - The variable `cur` is used to keep track of the current maximum MEX value.

4. **Processing Elements**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates the `M` dictionary and `cur` variable accordingly.
   - If a number is greater than `cur + 1`, it means a gap is found, and `cur` is updated to `cur + 1` and the loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, the count of the number in `M` is updated.

5. **Final Check**:
   - After processing all elements, the program checks if the total count of elements in `M` equals `S`.
   - If yes, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then iterates through the range `[0, cur)` to find the first index where the count in `M` is less than or equal to the index, and updates `cur` to that index.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final value of `cur` as the MEX of the array `c`.

### Verification:
- The program correctly implements the logic of finding the MEX by keeping track of the counts of numbers and identifying the smallest gap.
- It handles the case where all numbers from `0` to `cur - 1` are present in `c` and increments `cur` to `cur + 1` if all numbers are present.
- The final loop ensures that the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c` is found and returned.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly computes the MEX of the array `c` under the optimal play conditions for both Alice and Bob.

**Correctness: True**
