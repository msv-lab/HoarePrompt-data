Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously in the sky. Fireworks from two installations are launched at regular intervals (every `a` and `b` minutes, respectively), and each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch.

### Key Observations
1. **Visibility Period**: A firework launched at time `x` is visible from `x` to `x + m` inclusive.
2. **Simultaneous Visibility**: We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that overlap in the sky at any given time.
3. **Launch Times**: Fireworks from the first installation are launched at `a, 2a, 3a, ...` and from the second installation at `b, 2b, 3b, ...`.

### Approach
To solve this, we need to find a time `t` where the number of visible fireworks from both installations is maximized. The number of fireworks visible from the first installation at any time `t` is `t // a + 1` (since fireworks launched at `t - m, t - 2m, ..., 0` are visible at `t`). Similarly, for the second installation, it is `t // b + 1`.

However, the provided program calculates `m // a + m // b + 2`, which does not correctly account for the actual number of fireworks visible at any time `t`. This approach does not consider the actual launch times and visibility periods of the fireworks.

### Correctness of the Provided Program
The program provided does not correctly compute the maximum number of visible fireworks. It incorrectly calculates the number of fireworks launched before `m` minutes and adds 2, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Correct Solution
A correct solution would involve iterating over possible times `t` and calculating the number of visible fireworks from both installations at that time. However, a more efficient approach is to use mathematical insights to find the optimal time `t` where the number of visible fireworks is maximized.

### Conclusion
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time.

**Correctness: False**
