Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown
1. **mak**: This variable is set to `i` if the current input is `<`, otherwise `mak` remains 0.
2. **mak2**: This variable is initialized to 0.
3. **pans**: This is a list of all indices where `s` was `=`.
4. **n**: This must be greater than 1.
5. **i**: This variable is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis
- The `print` statement will output a string starting with `?` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak` again, `i`, and `i` again.
- Since `mak` is either `i` (if the current input is `<`) or `0` (otherwise), the output will reflect this.
- `i` is incremented by 1 before this print statement, so we need to consider its value at the point of execution.

### Determining the Output
- The value of `mak` will either be `i` (if the current input is `<`) or `0`.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1 before the print statement, so the value of `i` used in the print statement will be the incremented value.

### Conclusion
- If the current input is `<`, `mak` will be `i` (before it was incremented), and `i` will be `i + 1`.
- If the current input is not `<`, `mak` will be `0`, and `i` will be `i + 1`.

Given the lack of specific information about the current input, we must consider both possibilities. However, the problem statement asks for the most precise description possible based on the precondition, so we'll describe both scenarios.

### Final Output
If the current input is `<`, the output will be:
Output: **? [i] [i] [i+1] [i+1] (where i is the value before increment)**

If the current input is not `<`, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 [i+1] [i+1] (where i is the value before increment)**

Since the specific input is not provided, the most precise description based on the given information is:

Output: **? [mak] [mak] [i+1] [i+1] (where mak is i if the current input is <, otherwise 0, and i is the value before increment)**
