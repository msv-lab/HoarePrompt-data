To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and how the variables are defined based on the conditions provided.

### Initial State and Conditions:
1. `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed, which flushes the output buffer.
2. `s` is the string input by the user.
3. `i` is 4.
4. `n` remains unchanged (its value is not relevant to the print statement).
5. If `s` is equal to '<', then:
   - `mak` is set to `i`.
   - `pans` is set to `[i]`.
6. If `s` is equal to '=', then:
   - `pans` includes the value of `i` at the end of its current contents.
7. Otherwise, no changes are made to `pans`.

### Analysis:
- The value of `i` is explicitly given as 4.
- The value of `s` is not specified, so we need to consider all possible cases for `s` to determine the values of `mak` and `pans`.
- `mak2` is not defined in the initial state or any of the conditions, which means it is undefined in this context.

### Possible Cases for `s`:
1. **If `s` is '<':**
   - `mak` is set to `i`, so `mak` is 4.
   - `pans` is set to `[i]`, so `pans` is `[4]`.
   - `mak2` is undefined.

2. **If `s` is '=':**
   - `mak` is not defined, so it remains undefined.
   - `pans` includes the value of `i` at the end of its current contents, so if `pans` was previously defined, it would now include 4 at the end.
   - `mak2` is undefined.

3. **If `s` is neither '<' nor '=':**
   - No changes are made to `mak` and `pans`.
   - `mak` is undefined.
   - `pans` remains unchanged.
   - `mak2` is undefined.

### Conclusion:
Since `mak2` is not defined in any of the cases, it will result in a `NameError` if we attempt to print it. Therefore, the code as provided will raise an error when trying to print `mak2`.

However, if we assume the task is to describe the output based on the possible values of `mak` and `pans` while acknowledging `mak2` is undefined, the output would be:

- If `s` is '<':
  - Output: **? 4 <undefined> 4 <undefined>**
- If `s` is '=':
  - Output: **? <undefined> <undefined> 4 <undefined>**
- If `s` is neither '<' nor '=':
  - Output: **? <undefined> <undefined> 4 <undefined>**

Since `mak2` is undefined, the most precise description of the output, acknowledging the error, is:

Output: **NameError: name 'mak2' is not defined**
