The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. The initial value of `mak` is 0, but it is now updated to the value of `i`. The values of `mak2`, `pans`, and `n` remain unchanged. The current input is '<', but it does not affect the variables in this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`mak` is `i`, `mak2` remains the initial value, `pans` remains the initial value, `n` must be greater than 1**.
