Postcondition: **`sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed, `s` is the string input by the user. If `s` is equal to '<', then `mak` is equal to `i` and `pans` is `[i]`. If `s` is equal to '=', then `pans` includes the value of `i` at the end of its current contents. Otherwise, no changes are made to `pans`.**
