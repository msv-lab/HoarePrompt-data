Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `mak` is the largest value of `i` (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `mak2` is equal to `mak`.**

In simple terms, the value of `mak2` is now the same as the value of `mak`. All other variables (`t` and `n`) remain unchanged.
