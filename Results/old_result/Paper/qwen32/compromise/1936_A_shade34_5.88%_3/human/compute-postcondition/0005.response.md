The code snippet provided is `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the file (or standard output). This operation does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, or `mak`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` must be greater than 1, `mak` is 0**.
