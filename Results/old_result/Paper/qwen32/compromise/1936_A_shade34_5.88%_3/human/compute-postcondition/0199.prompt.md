Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `mak` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations; `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations; `pans` is an empty list; `n` remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    s = str(input())
    if s == '<':
        mak = i
        pans = [i]
    elif s == '=':
        pans.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mak` is `i` if `s` is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations. `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations. `pans` is a list containing the value `i` if `s` is `'<'` or `'='`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list. `n` is greater than 0. `s` is the string input provided by the user.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `mak` is 4 if `s` is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations. `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations. `pans` is a list containing the value 4 if `s` is `'<'`, the value `i` if `s` is `'='`, or an empty list if `s` is neither `'<'` nor `'='`. `n` is greater than 0. `s` is the new string input provided by the user. `i` is 4.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `mak` is 5 if `s` is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` retains its previous value which is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations. `mak2` retains its previous value which is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations. `pans` is `[5]` if `s` is `'<'`, or retains its previous value which includes `4` if the previous `s` was `'<'`, the value `i` if the previous `s` was `'='`, or an empty list if the previous `s` was neither `'<'` nor `'='`. If the previous `s` was `'='` and the current `s` is not `'<'`, `pans` now includes the value `5`. `n` is greater than 0. `s` is the new string input provided by the user. `i` is 5.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
