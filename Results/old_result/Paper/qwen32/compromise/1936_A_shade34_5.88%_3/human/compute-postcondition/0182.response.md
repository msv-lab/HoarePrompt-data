To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **mak**: This variable is set to `i` if `s` is `'<'`. Otherwise, it is set to the last value of `i` for which `s` was `'<'`, or `n-1` if `s` was `'<'` for all iterations.
2. **mak2**: This variable is the last value of `i` for which `s` was `'<'`, or `n-1` if `s` was `'<'` for all iterations.
3. **pans**: This list contains the value `i` if `s` is `'<'` or `'='`. Otherwise, it remains an empty list.
4. **n**: This is a positive integer, but its exact value is not specified.
5. **s**: This is the string input provided by the user, but its exact value is not specified.
6. **i**: This variable is explicitly set to 4.

### Determining the Values:
- Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we cannot definitively state whether `mak` and `mak2` will be `i` (which is 4) or `n-1`.
- However, the problem asks us to provide the most precise description possible based on the given information.

### Case Analysis:
1. **If `s` is `'<'`**:
   - `mak` will be `i`, which is 4.
   - `mak2` will also be `i`, which is 4.
2. **If `s` is not `'<'`**:
   - `mak` will be the last value of `i` for which `s` was `'<'`. Since the exact value of `s` for previous iterations is not provided, we can't determine this value precisely. However, if `s` was `'<'` for all iterations, `mak` would be `n-1`.
   - `mak2` will be the last value of `i` for which `s` was `'<'`. Similarly, if `s` was `'<'` for all iterations, `mak2` would be `n-1`.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```
Given the information, the most precise description we can provide is:

- If `s` is `'<'`, `mak` and `mak2` will both be 4.
- If `s` is not `'<'`, `mak` and `mak2` could be the last value of `i` for which `s` was `'<'`, or `n-1` if `s` was `'<'` for all iterations.

Since we don't have the exact value of `s` for previous iterations, we can't determine the exact values of `mak` and `mak2` in the case where `s` is not `'<'`. However, we can describe the possible values.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [mak] [mak2] 4 [mak2] (where [mak] and [mak2] are either 4 if s is '<', or the last value of i for which s was '<', or n-1 if s was '<' for all iterations)**
