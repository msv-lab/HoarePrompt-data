The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the `range(1, n)` function generates numbers starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute.

Given the state before the loop starts: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is an input integer; `mak` is 0. The variable `t` and `mak` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` must be greater than 1, `mak` is 0**
