The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `pans`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and the length of `pans`. If `i` is less than the length of `pans`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last value it took, and `pans` is a list of indices where `s` was '=' and must have at least 2 elements. Since the loop iterates from `1` to `len(pans) - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than the length of `pans`.

Let's determine the new state:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `len(pans) - 1` for the loop to have just finished.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be `1` initially (if it just started) or incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `mak` and `mak2` are not part of the loop head and thus remain unchanged.
- `pans` must have at least 2 elements, and its length does not change.

Given that `i` was `len(pans) - 1` at the end of the loop, for the loop to execute again, we need to consider the state right before the last iteration. Therefore, `i` should be `len(pans) - 2` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`mak` is `i` if the input provided is `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices where `s` was '=' and must have at least 2 elements, `n` remains unchanged, `i` is `len(pans) - 2`**
