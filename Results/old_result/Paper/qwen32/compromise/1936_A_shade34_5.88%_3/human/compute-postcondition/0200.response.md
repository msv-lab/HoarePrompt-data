Output State: **`mak` is 0, `mak2` is the last index i for which the input was '<', or n-1 if no '<' was received; `pans` contains all indices i for which the input was '=', and the last index i for which the input was '<' if such an input was received; `n` remains unchanged.**

Natural language: The variable `mak` is now set to 0. The variables `mak2`, `pans`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
