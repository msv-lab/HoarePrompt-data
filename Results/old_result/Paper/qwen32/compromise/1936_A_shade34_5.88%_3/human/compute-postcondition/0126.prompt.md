Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `mak` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `mak2` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `pans` is an empty list, `n` is the input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    s = str(input())
    if s == '<':
        mak = i
        pans = [i]
    elif s == '=':
        pans.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mak` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<'. `mak2` remains the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<'. `pans` is `[i]` if `s` is equal to '<', otherwise `pans` is an empty list if `s` is not equal to '<'. `n` is greater than 0, and `s` is the input string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `mak` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<'. `mak2` remains the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<'. `pans` is `[i]` if `s` is equal to '<', otherwise `pans` remains unchanged. `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, and `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `mak` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<'. `mak2` remains the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<'. `pans` is `[i]` if the current `s` is '<', otherwise `pans` is either unchanged or has the new `i` appended to it if `s` is not '='. `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `s` is '=', `pans` remains unchanged from its state before the if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
