To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to understand the values of `mak` and `mak2` based on the initial state provided.

1. **mak**: This variable is defined as the last index `i` where the input was '>', or 0 if no '>' was received.
2. **mak2**: This variable is defined as the last index `i` where the input was '<', or `n-1` if no '<' was received.

Given this information, the print statement `print('!', mak2, mak)` will output the values of `mak2` and `mak` preceded by an exclamation mark.

Since the exact input or the value of `n` is not provided, we cannot determine the precise numerical values of `mak` and `mak2`. However, we can describe their values based on the conditions given:

- `mak` will be the last index where the input was '>', or 0 if no '>' was received.
- `mak2` will be the last index where the input was '<', or `n-1` if no '<' was received.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **! mak2 mak (where mak2 is the last index where the input was '<' or n-1 if no '<' was received, and mak is the last index where the input was '>' or 0 if no '>' was received)**
