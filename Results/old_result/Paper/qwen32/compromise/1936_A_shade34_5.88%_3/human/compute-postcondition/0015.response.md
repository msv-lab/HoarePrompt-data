Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
2. `n` is greater than 1.
3. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement includes a literal string `'?'` followed by the variable `mak` twice and the variable `i` twice.
- The initial state does not provide any information about the variable `mak`.
- The variable `i` is described as being incremented by 1 from its previous value, but its initial value is not provided. Therefore, we can only describe `i` in terms of its incrementation.

### Conclusion:
- Since the value of `mak` is not provided, we cannot determine its exact value.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, but without knowing its initial value, we can only describe it as `i` (incremented by 1).

### Output:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] [i] [i] (where [mak] is the value of mak and [i] is the value of i incremented by 1 from its previous value)**
