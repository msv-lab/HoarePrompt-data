The value of `mak2` is updated to be equal to the value of `mak`. The other variables, `mak`, `pans`, and `n`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`mak` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations; `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations; `pans` remains its initial value; `n` remains unchanged.**
