Postcondition: **`mak` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `mak2` remains the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `pans` is `[i]` if `s` is equal to '<', otherwise `pans` remains unchanged if `s` is not equal to '<'. `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
