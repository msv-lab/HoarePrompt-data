Postcondition: **`mak` is `i` if `s` is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations. `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations. `pans` is a list containing the value `i` if `s` is `'<'` or `'='`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list. `n` is greater than 0. `s` is the string input provided by the user.**
