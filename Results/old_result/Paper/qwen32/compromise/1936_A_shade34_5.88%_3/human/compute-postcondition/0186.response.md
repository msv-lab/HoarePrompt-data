The value of `pans` is updated to be a list containing the current value of `i`, which is 4. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`mak` is 4, `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations; `pans` is a list containing the value 4; `n` is greater than 0; `s` is the new string input provided by the user; `i` is 4.**
