The provided code snippet assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. However, the initial state does not specify a value for `i`. Therefore, we can only state that `mak` will be assigned whatever value `i` holds.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is the value of `i`, and the current input is the string `'<'`.**
