Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The sequence p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The interaction involves asking queries in the form "? a b c d" where 0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n, and receiving a response of "<", "=", or ">" based on the comparison of (p_a | p_b) and (p_c | p_d). The goal is to find indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized using at most 3n queries. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.**
