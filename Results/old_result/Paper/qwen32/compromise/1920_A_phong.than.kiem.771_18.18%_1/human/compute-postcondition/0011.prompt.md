You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: space is a boolean indicating whether the input line should be split into multiple items, and to_int is a boolean indicating whether the items should be converted to integers.
def func_2(space, to_int):
    line = input()
    if space :
        items = line.split()
    else :
        items = list(line)
    #State: `space` is a boolean, `to_int` is a boolean, `line` is the input string provided by the user. If `space` is True, `items` is a list of substrings from `line` split by whitespace. Otherwise, `items` is a list of characters from `line`.
    if to_int :
        return [int(i) for i in items]
        #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer is derived from converting each substring in `items` to an integer. If `space` is True, `items` is a list of substrings from `line` split by whitespace. Otherwise, `items` is a list of characters from `line`. Since `to_int` is True, each element in `items` is converted to an integer.
    else :
        return items
        #The program returns `items`, which is a list of characters from `line` since `space` is False.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two boolean parameters, `space` and `to_int`. If `space` is True and `to_int` is True, it returns a list of integers by splitting a line into substrings based on whitespace and converting each substring to an integer. If `space` is False, it returns a list of characters from the line.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns a list of integers, where each integer is derived from converting each substring in `items` to an integer. If `space` is True, `items` is a list of substrings from `line` split by whitespace. Otherwise, `items` is a list of characters from `line`. Since `to_int` is True, each element in `items` is converted to an integer.

Case_2: The program returns `items`, which is a list of characters from `line` since `space` is False.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
