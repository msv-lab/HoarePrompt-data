### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements when the array is arranged in a certain order. Specifically, the beauty is calculated as:

\[ \text{Beauty} = (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) \]

This can be simplified to:

\[ \text{Beauty} = a_n - a_1 \]

This means that to maximize the beauty, we should place the smallest element at the beginning of the array and the largest element at the end. All other elements can be arranged in between in any order, but it will not affect the beauty since the intermediate differences will cancel out in the sum.

The provided code sorts the array and then calculates the difference between the last (maximum) and the first (minimum) elements of the sorted array. This approach correctly computes the maximum possible beauty for each test case as per the problem's requirements.
