### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

**Problem Recap:**
- We need to maximize the "beauty" of an array, defined as the sum of differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
- The beauty can be maximized by strategically arranging the elements such that the consecutive differences are maximized.

**Current Code Analysis:**
- The code reads multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the array, sorts it, and computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values.
- The function summary confirms that the code computes the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted array.

**Key Insight:**
- The beauty of the array is the sum of consecutive differences, not just the difference between the maximum and minimum values.
- To maximize the beauty, we should arrange the array in a way that maximizes the absolute value of consecutive differences. One effective strategy is to alternate between the largest and smallest remaining elements.

**Counterexample Analysis:**
- Consider the input: `1 4 1 2 3 4`.
- The correct maximum beauty can be achieved by arranging the array as `[1, 4, 2, 3]` or `[4, 1, 3, 2]`, which results in a beauty of \( (4-1) + (2-4) + (3-2) = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2 \) or \( (1-4) + (3-1) + (2-3) = -3 + 2 - 1 = -2 \) respectively. However, the optimal arrangement is `[1, 4, 2, 3]` or `[4, 1, 3, 2]` which gives \( (4-1) + (2-4) + (3-2) = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2 \) or \( (1-4) + (3-1) + (2-3) = -3 + 2 - 1 = -2 \) respectively, but the maximum beauty is achieved by `[1, 3, 2, 4]` or `[4, 2, 3, 1]` which gives \( (3-1) + (2-3) + (4-2) = 2 - 1 + 2 = 3 \) or \( (2-4) + (3-2) + (1-3) = -2 + 1 - 2 = -3 \) respectively, but the maximum beauty is achieved by `[1, 4, 2, 3]` or `[4, 1, 3, 2]` which gives \( (4-1) + (3-4) + (2-3) + (4-2) = 3 -1 + 1 + 2 = 5\).

- The provided code would output \(4 - 1 = 3\), which is incorrect.

**Conclusion:**
- The original assessment is correct. The provided code does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array. It only computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which is insufficient.
