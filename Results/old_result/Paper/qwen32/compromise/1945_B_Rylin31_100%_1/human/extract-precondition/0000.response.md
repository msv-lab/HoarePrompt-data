Precondition: **Each test case consists of three integers a, b, and m (1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18) representing the frequency of launching fireworks for the first and second installations, and the visibility duration of each firework, respectively. The input starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases, followed by t lines, each containing the integers a, b, and m for a test case.**
