Reasoning:
The provided program calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously using the formula `m // a + m // b + 2`. However, this formula does not correctly account for the overlap of fireworks' visibility times or the simultaneous launches from both installations.

To correctly solve the problem, one needs to determine the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period and account for any overlaps due to simultaneous launches. The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` does not consider these factors and appears to be incorrect based on the problem description and the given examples.

For instance, in the first example with `a = 6`, `b = 7`, and `m = 4`, the correct answer is `2`, which the formula does not produce. The formula would output `m // 6 + m // 7 + 2 = 4 // 6 + 4 // 7 + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2`, which coincidentally matches the correct answer for this specific case but is not a general solution.

In the third example with `a = 7`, `b = 8`, and `m = 56`, the correct answer is `17`, but the formula would output `m // 7 + m // 8 + 2 = 56 // 7 + 56 // 8 + 2 = 8 + 7 + 2 = 17`, which again matches the correct answer but still does not reflect the correct general approach.

The formula does not correctly handle the overlap of fireworks' visibility periods or simultaneous launches, so it is not a reliable solution for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
