Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` does not account for the overlap in visibility periods of fireworks from both installations. 

To correctly determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to find the time intervals during which fireworks from both installations are visible simultaneously. This involves considering the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and how fireworks from both installations overlap within a given period.

The correct approach involves:
1. Calculating the LCM of `a` and `b`.
2. Determining how many fireworks from each installation are visible within a period of LCM.
3. Calculating the overlap of visibility periods of fireworks from both installations.

The given program does not implement this logic and instead uses a simplified and incorrect formula.

Correctness: **False**
