### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program is incorrect. The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` does not accurately determine the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect and why the original assessment is accurate:

1. **Counting Fireworks within `m` Minutes:**
   - `m // a` counts the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the first `m` minutes. Similarly, `m // b` counts the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the first `m` minutes.
   - However, these counts do not account for fireworks launched after `m` minutes but still visible within the `m+1` minute visibility window.

2. **Overlapping Visibility Periods:**
   - The formula does not consider the overlap between the visibility periods of fireworks from both installations. For example, if a firework from the first installation is launched at time `x` and another from the second installation is launched at time `y`, they might overlap in visibility if `|x - y| <= m`.

3. **Least Common Multiple (LCM):**
   - To find the maximum number of overlapping fireworks, one should consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`. This is because the LCM gives the smallest time span after which the launch patterns of both installations repeat.
   - Within this LCM period, one needs to count the number of fireworks visible at each minute and determine the maximum count.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct solution involves iterating over the LCM period and counting the number of fireworks visible at each minute. This requires a more complex algorithm than the simple formula used in the provided program.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of overlapping fireworks.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
