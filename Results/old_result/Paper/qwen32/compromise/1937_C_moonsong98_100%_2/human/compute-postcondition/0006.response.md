The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. The current state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2, which ensures that `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment to `n` is necessary for the loop to execute.

The variable `i` is the loop control variable and will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, so no adjustment to `i` is required before the loop starts.

Since the state of `max_index` is not part of the loop head, it does not need to be adjusted. However, it is mentioned in the initial state, so we will keep it as is.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2, `max_index` is 0, `i` is 0**
