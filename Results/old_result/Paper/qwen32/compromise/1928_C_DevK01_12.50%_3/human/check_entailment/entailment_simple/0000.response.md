To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to carefully analyze both the logic and the provided execution states. The problem requires us to find all possible values of `k` such that the position `n` and the number `x` Vasya received during the settling match the described pattern.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Main Loop:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (Vasya's position) and `x` (Vasya's number).
   - It calculates `y = n + x` and checks if `y` is odd. If `y` is odd, it prints `0` because the pattern described in the problem requires `y` to be even.
   - If `y` is even, it calls `func_1` with `(y - 2) // 2` and `x` to find possible values of `k`.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it calls `func_1` again with `(n - x) // 2` and `x` and combines the results.
   - It removes duplicates from the list of possible `k` values and prints the count.

2. **Function `func_1(q, x)`:**
   - This function finds all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It first checks if the integer square root of `q` is a divisor and greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It then iterates through numbers from `1` to the integer square root of `q` to find all divisors and their corresponding quotients that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - The function returns a list of these divisors.

### Reasoning:

- The program correctly identifies the need for `y` to be even and handles this condition.
- The function `func_1` correctly identifies all possible values of `k` by finding divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
- The program combines the results from both calls to `func_1` and removes duplicates, ensuring that the final count of valid `k` values is accurate.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described in the problem statement and the examples provided. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
