The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `M`. The variables `q`, `n`, and `x` are part of the initial state and are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state will only reflect the change to `M`.

Output State: **`q` is an integer representing the number of test cases such that 1 <= q <= 100, and for each test case, there are two integers `n` and `x` where 1 <= x < n <= 10^9; `M` is an empty list.**
