The code snippet appends the value of `w` to the list `M`. Since `M` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `M` will contain a single element which is the value of `w`. The other variables `q` and `w` remain unchanged, and the condition that `w` is the square root of `q` and an integer, and that `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` is still valid.

Output State: **`q` is an integer representing the number of test cases such that 1 <= q <= 100, `w` is the square root of `q` and `w` is an integer (i.e., `w == w // 1`), `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, and `M` is a list containing the single element `w`.**
