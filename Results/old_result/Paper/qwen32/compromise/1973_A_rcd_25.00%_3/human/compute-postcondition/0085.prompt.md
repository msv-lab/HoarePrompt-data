Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. There are t such test cases.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
    if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
        print(-1)
        continue
    if p3 >= p1 + p2:
        print(p1 + p2)
    else:
        low, high = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)
        cur = low
        while high >= cur:
            if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                print(p1 - cur + p3)
                break
            else:
                cur += 1
        else:
            print(p3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, then `p3` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `p3` remains unchanged as well.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Since the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is already given to be odd, the else part will never execute, and thus the state of the variables remains unchanged after the if-else block.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program executes the if part. Since the else part does not execute, no additional actions related to `cur`, `high`, or the loop are performed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
