The code assigns the value of `low` to `cur`. Given that `low` is defined as `p3 - p2`, the value of `cur` will be `p3 - p2`. The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged except for `cur`, which is now set to `p3 - p2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is `p3 - p2`, `high` is `p3 - p1`, `cur` is `p3 - p2`.**
