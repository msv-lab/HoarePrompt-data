Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` and `high` must be at least `low + 1`; `cur` is `low + 1`**

Natural language description: The value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, so it is now `low + 1`. All other variables (`t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and `high`) remain unchanged.
