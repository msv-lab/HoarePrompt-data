Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Given Initial State:
- `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\).
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `low` is `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is `p3 - p1`.
- `cur` is `p3 - p2`.
- `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(p1 - cur + p3)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `cur`:**
   - `cur` is defined as `p3 - p2`.
   
2. **Expression Inside the Print Statement:**
   - The expression to be printed is `p1 - cur + p3`.
   - Substituting `cur` with `p3 - p2`, the expression becomes:
     \[
     p1 - (p3 - p2) + p3
     \]
   - Simplifying the expression:
     \[
     p1 - p3 + p2 + p3 = p1 + p2
     \]

3. **Final Expression:**
   - The expression simplifies to `p1 + p2`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **p1 + p2**
