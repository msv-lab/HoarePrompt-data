The only variable in the loop head is `cur`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cur`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`.

At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1` depending on the condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `cur` must be less than `high`.

Given that `cur` can only be `low` or `low + 1`, we need to ensure that `high` is greater than `cur`. Therefore, `high` must be at least `low + 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted as per the task requirements.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` and `high` must be at least `low + 1`; If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, `cur` remains `low`. Otherwise, `cur` is updated to `low + 1`**
