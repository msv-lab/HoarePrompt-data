To ensure that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `high` and `cur` based on the loop condition `high >= cur`.

Given the current state:
- `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`
- `low` is `p3 - p2`
- `high` is `p3 - p1`
- `cur` is determined by the condition: If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, `cur` remains `low`. Otherwise, `cur` is `low + 1` and `p1 - cur` is greater than `p2 - (p3 - cur)`

The loop condition is `high >= cur`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`.

Let's analyze the possible values of `cur`:
- If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, then `cur` is `low`.
- Otherwise, `cur` is `low + 1`.

Since `low` is `p3 - p2` and `high` is `p3 - p1`, we need to ensure that `high` is at least `low` or `low + 1` depending on the condition for `cur`.

To simplify, let's assume that after the previous iteration, `cur` has been set to `low` or `low + 1`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure `high` is at least `cur`.

Given that `high` is `p3 - p1` and `low` is `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1`, we need to ensure that `p3 - p1` is at least `p3 - p2` or `p3 - p2 + 1`.

Therefore, the condition `high >= cur` can be satisfied if `p3 - p1` is at least `p3 - p2 + 1`, which simplifies to `p1 <= p2 - 1`.

However, since we need to ensure the loop can execute one more time without making assumptions about the exact values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, we can simply state that `high` must be at least `cur`.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`; `low` is `p3 - p2`; `high` is `p3 - p1` and `high` must be at least `cur`; `cur` is determined by the condition: If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, `cur` remains `low`. Otherwise, `cur` is `low + 1` and `p1 - cur` is greater than `p2 - (p3 - cur)`**
