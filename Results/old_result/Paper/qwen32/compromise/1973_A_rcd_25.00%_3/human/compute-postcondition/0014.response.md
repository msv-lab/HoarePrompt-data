Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\).
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
- `low` is defined as `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is defined as `p3 - p1`.
- `cur` is defined as `low`.
- It holds that `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(p1 - cur + p3)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Define `cur`**:
   - `cur` is defined as `low`, which is `p3 - p2`.

2. **Substitute `cur` in the Print Statement**:
   - The expression `p1 - cur + p3` becomes `p1 - (p3 - p2) + p3`.

3. **Simplify the Expression**:
   - `p1 - (p3 - p2) + p3` simplifies to `p1 - p3 + p2 + p3`.
   - Further simplification gives `p1 + p2`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement `print(p1 - cur + p3)` simplifies to `print(p1 + p2)`. Therefore, the output will be the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

### Output:
Output: **p1 + p2**
