Output State: **`t` is an input integer, each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. There are t such test cases.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to be the integer input by the user, representing the number of test cases. The conditions and properties of the test cases (scores p_1, p_2, p_3) remain unchanged.
