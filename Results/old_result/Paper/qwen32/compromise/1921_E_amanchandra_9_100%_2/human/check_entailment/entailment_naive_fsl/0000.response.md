Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze a specific case to demonstrate this:

Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 3 1 1 3 3
```
In this scenario, Alice starts at (1, 1) and Bob starts at (3, 3). Alice can move down-right to (2, 2), and then Bob can move up-left to (2, 2), capturing Alice's chip. Therefore, Bob should win in this case.

However, the program will output "Draw" for this input. Here's why:

The program uses the following logic to determine the winner:
1. If Alice's row (a) is greater than Bob's row (c), it outputs "Draw".
2. Otherwise, it calculates `x = abs(a - c) // 2`, which is `1` in this case.
3. Since `abs(a - c)` is odd, it calculates `l = max(1, d - x)` and `r = min(w, d + x)`, which results in `l = 2` and `r = 2`.
4. It then checks if `abs(l - b) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - b) <= x + 1`. In this case, `abs(2 - 1) <= 2` and `abs(2 - 1) <= 2` are both true, so it outputs "Alice".
5. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Draw" because of the logic in the ternary operator.

The logic in the program is flawed and does not correctly simulate the optimal moves for both players. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
