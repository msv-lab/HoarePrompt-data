You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.

        elif 2 * a < b:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's break down the logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

The problem requires us to calculate the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy exactly `n` yogurts given the prices `a` (for one yogurt) and `b` (for two yogurts under promotion).

Here's the step-by-step reasoning for the provided program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. It then checks if `n` is odd or even.
4. If `n` is odd:
   - It checks if buying two yogurts at the promotion price `b` is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the regular price `2 * a`.
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt separately is cheaper, so it calculates the total cost as `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the total cost as the cost for `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price `b` plus the cost of one additional yogurt at the regular price `a`.
5. If `n` is even:
   - It checks if buying two yogurts at the promotion price `b` is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the regular price `2 * a`.
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt separately is cheaper, so it calculates the total cost as `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the total cost as the cost for `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price `b`.

This logic correctly handles both odd and even values of `n` and compares the costs of buying yogurts individually versus in pairs under promotion to determine the minimum cost.

The provided program correctly implements the above logic. Therefore, it should produce the correct output for the given problem.
