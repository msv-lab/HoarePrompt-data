Let's analyze the given program and the annotations to ensure the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Breakdown
The problem requires us to determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts given the following:
- The price of one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The price of two yogurts under promotion is `b` burles.

### Program Logic
The program handles each test case by:
1. Checking if `n` (the number of yogurts) is odd or even.
2. If `n` is odd:
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it buys `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price `b` and one additional yogurt at the regular price `a`, resulting in a total cost of `n // 2 * b + a`.
3. If `n` is even:
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it buys `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price `b`, resulting in a total cost of `n // 2 * b`.

### Annotations Analysis
The annotations confirm the state of the program at key points:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
- For each test case, it correctly reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- The logic for handling odd and even `n` is correctly implemented, with the conditions and calculations as described.

### Verification Against Examples
Let's verify the program against the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Since `n` is even and `2 * a (10) > b (9)`, the cost is `n // 2 * b = 1 * 9 = 9`.
   - Output: `9` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Since `n` is odd and `2 * a (10) > b (9)`, the cost is `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
   - Output: `14` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Since `n` is odd and `2 * a (10) < b (11)`, the cost is `a * n = 5 * 3 = 15`.
   - Output: `15` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Since `n` is even and `2 * a (10) < b (11)`, the cost is `a * n = 5 * 4 = 20`.
   - Output: `20` (Correct)

### Final Evaluation
The program correctly handles both odd and even values of `n` and compares the costs of buying yogurts individually versus in pairs under promotion to determine the minimum cost. The logic aligns with the problem requirements and the provided examples confirm the correctness of the solution.

**Final: True**
