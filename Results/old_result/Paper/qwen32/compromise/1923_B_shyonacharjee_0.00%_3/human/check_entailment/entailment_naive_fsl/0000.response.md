Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not account for the fact that the bullets used in one second can be distributed among multiple monsters. The current implementation assumes that all bullets needed to kill a monster must be fired in the same second the monster is within range, which is not the case according to the problem description.

Here is an example that demonstrates the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3 2
1 2 3
-1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- In the first second, fire 1 bullet at the 1st monster and 1 bullet at the 3rd monster. The 1st monster dies, and the 2nd and 3rd monsters move closer.
- In the second second, fire 2 bullets at the 2nd monster. The 2nd monster dies, and the 3rd monster moves closer.
- In the third second, fire 2 bullets at the 3rd monster. The 3rd monster dies.

**Program Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation of the Program Output:**
- The program calculates the total bullets needed to kill each monster and checks if the total bullets used so far plus the bullets needed for the current monster exceed the time available (distance to point 0).
- The program assumes that all bullets for a monster must be fired in the same second the monster is within range, which is incorrect. In the example, the program would fail because it would try to fire 3 bullets in the third second, which is not allowed.

To fix the program, we need to ensure that bullets can be distributed over multiple seconds as long as the total number of bullets used does not exceed the available time (distance to point 0) for each monster.
