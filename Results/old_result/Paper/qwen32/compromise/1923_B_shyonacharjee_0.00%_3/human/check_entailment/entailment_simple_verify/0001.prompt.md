You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the monsters based on their distance from the character (point 0 on the line). The idea is to prioritize shooting at the monsters that are closest to the character, as they are the most immediate threat.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of monsters, `n`, and the number of bullets that can be fired per second, `k`.
   - It then reads the health values of the monsters and their respective positions on the line.

2. **Sorting Monsters:**
   - The monsters are sorted based on their distance from the character (point 0). This is done using the `sorted` function with a lambda function that sorts by the absolute value of the position.

3. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - The program initializes `total_bullets_used` to 0 and `success` to `True`.
   - It iterates through the sorted list of monsters.
   - For each monster, it calculates the distance (`abs(position)`) and the time available to shoot at it (`time_available`), which is the same as the distance.
   - It also calculates the `bullets_needed` to kill the monster, which is equal to the monster's health.
   - If the total number of bullets used so far plus the bullets needed to kill the current monster exceeds the time available, it sets `success` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without setting `success` to `False`, the program prints "YES", indicating that it is possible to kill all monsters before they reach the character. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Issues with the Program:
- **Ignoring the Number of Bullets per Second (`k`):** The program does not consider the constraint that only up to `k` bullets can be fired per second. It assumes that you can fire as many bullets as needed in a single second to kill a monster, which is not allowed according to the problem statement.
- **Incorrect Logic for Multiple Monsters:** The program does not account for the fact that multiple monsters can move towards the character in the same second. If there are multiple monsters within a certain distance, the program should ensure that the total number of bullets fired does not exceed `k` per second.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as per the constraints provided. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
