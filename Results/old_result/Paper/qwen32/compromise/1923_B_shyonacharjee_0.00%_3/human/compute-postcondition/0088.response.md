Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is the second input integer, `healths` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `total_bullets_used` is 0, `success` is False, `i` is `n`, `position` is the position from the tuple at index `n` in `monsters`, `health` is the health from the tuple at index `n` in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is the absolute value of `position`, `bullets_needed` is the health from the tuple at index `n` in `monsters`, and `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`.**

This means that the variable `success` has been set to `False`, while all other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
