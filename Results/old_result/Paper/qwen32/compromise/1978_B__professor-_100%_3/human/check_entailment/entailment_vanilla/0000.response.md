Let's examine the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding:
Bob is selling `n` buns. For the first `k` buns, he can sell them at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b-k+1`. The remaining `n-k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`. The goal is to find the maximum profit Bob can make.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of buns), `a` (usual price of a bun), and `b` (price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price).

2. **Logic:**
   - The program first checks if `b <= a`. If true, it means the modified price is not beneficial, so Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`. The profit is `n * a`.
   - If `b - a >= n`, it implies that the modified price difference is large enough to benefit from selling all buns at the modified price. The sum of the first `n` terms of the sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \((2b - n + 1) * n // 2\).
   - If `b - a < n`, it means the modified price difference is not enough to benefit from selling all buns at the modified price, but there's still a benefit from selling some buns at the modified price. The program calculates the profit by selling `b - a` buns at the modified price and the rest at the usual price `a`. The sum of the first `b - a` terms of the sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2\). The profit from the remaining buns is `a * n`.

### Testing the Logic:
Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `4 4 5`
   - Since `b - a = 1` and `n = 4`, the optimal `k` is 1 (as `b - a < n`). So, the profit is \(5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17\), which matches the output.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `5 5 9`
   - Since `b - a = 4` and `n = 5`, the optimal `k` is 5 (as `b - a < n`). So, the profit is \(9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35\), which matches the output.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `10 10 5`
   - Since `b <= a`, the profit is \(10 * 10 = 100\), which matches the output.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `5 5 11`
   - Since `b - a = 6` and `n = 5`, the optimal `k` is 5 (as `b - a >= n`). So, the profit is \(11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 = 45\), which matches the output.

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
   - Since `b = a`, the profit is \(1000000000 * 1000000000\), which matches the output.

6. **Example 6:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1`
   - Since `b <= a`, the profit is \(1000000000 * 1000000000\), which matches the output.

7. **Example 7:**
   - Input: `1000 1 1000`
   - Since `b - a = 999` and `n = 1000`, the optimal `k` is 999 (as `b - a < n`). So, the profit is the sum of the first 999 terms of the sequence starting from 1000 and decreasing by 1 each time plus `1 * 1000`. This matches the output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
