### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided program and verify its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program starts by reading an integer `t`, representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of buns), `a` (usual price of a bun), and `b` (price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price).

2. **Logic for Computing Maximum Profit**:
   - **Case 1: \( b \leq a \)**:
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a` to maximize profit.
     - The profit in this case is \( n \times a \).
   - **Case 2: \( b - a \geq n \)**:
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, Bob should sell all buns at the modified prices, starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 for each subsequent bun.
     - The profit in this case is the sum of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and ending at \( b - n + 1 \). The sum of this series is given by the formula \( \frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2} \).
   - **Case 3: \( b > a \) and \( b - a < n \)**:
     - If the difference between `b` and `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, Bob should sell the first \( k = b - a \) buns at the modified prices (starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 for each subsequent bun) and the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price `a`.
     - The profit in this case is the sum of the first \( k \) terms of the arithmetic series starting from `b` (which is \( \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} \)) plus the profit from selling the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price `a` (which is \( a \times (n - k) \)).

3. **Verification with Example Test Cases**:
   - **First Test Case (n=4, a=4, b=5)**:
     - Since \( b > a \) and \( b - a < n \), Bob should sell the first \( k = 1 \) bun at 5 coins and the remaining 3 buns at 4 coins each.
     - Profit = \( 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 \).
   - **Second Test Case (n=5, a=5, b=9)**:
     - Since \( b - a \geq n \), Bob should sell all 5 buns at the modified prices.
     - Profit = \( 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35 \).
   - **Third Test Case (n=10, a=10, b=5)**:
     - Since \( b \leq a \), Bob should sell all 10 buns at the usual price.
     - Profit = \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \).

The program handles all the described cases correctly and produces the expected output for the provided examples.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct as it implements the logic described in the problem statement and produces the correct results for the given test cases.

**Correctness: True**
