You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440. Each of the following t lines contains a string s of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where hh is a two-digit string representing the hour from "00" to "23" and mm is a two-digit string representing the minute from "00" to "59". The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        h = s[:2]
        
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
        
    #State: Each of the t lines contains a string in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM" representing the corresponding input time in 12-hour format with AM/PM notation.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of time entries (where 1 <= t <= 1440). Following this, it accepts `t` lines of strings, each in the format "hh:mm" representing valid times in 24-hour format. The function returns the count of unique times provided in the input.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
