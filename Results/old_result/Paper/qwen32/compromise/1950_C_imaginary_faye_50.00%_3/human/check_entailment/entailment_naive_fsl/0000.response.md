Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for certain cases:

1. **Leading Zeroes in Hours**: The program does not handle leading zeroes correctly for hours between 1 and 9 in the 12-hour format. For example, it prints "9" instead of "09" for times like "09:41".

2. **Midnight and Noon Handling**: The program incorrectly handles "00:00" and "12:00". It should print "12:00 AM" for "00:00" and "12:00 PM" for "12:00", but it prints "12:00 AM" for both.

3. **Incorrect AM/PM Decision**: The program incorrectly decides between AM and PM. For example, it prints "PM" for times from "12:00" to "12:59", but it should print "AM" for "12:00" and "PM" for "13:00" to "23:59".

Here is a corrected version of the program for reference:

```python
def convert_to_12_hour_format(hh, mm):
    hh = int(hh)
    period = "AM"
    if hh == 0:
        hh = 12
    elif hh == 12:
        period = "PM"
    elif hh > 12:
        hh -= 12
        period = "PM"
    
    return f"{hh:02}:{mm} {period}"

def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input().split(':')
        print(convert_to_12_hour_format(s[0], s[1]))

func_1()
```

This corrected version handles all edge cases and formats the output correctly.
