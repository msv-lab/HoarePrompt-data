The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means the value of `n` is now updated based on the input provided, but the initial conditions for `t` and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, and `p_i` != `i`.**
