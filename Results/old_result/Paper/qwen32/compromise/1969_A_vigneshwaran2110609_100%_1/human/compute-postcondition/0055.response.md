Let's analyze the given task step by step.

The loop provided is:
```python
for i in range(0, x):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the description, we know:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i + 1`.
- `x` is greater than 0.
- `l` is a list.
- The condition `if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` determines whether `flag` is set to `True` and the loop breaks. Otherwise, no changes are made to `flag`.

We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop. The only variables in the loop head that can be adjusted are `i` and `x`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i + 1`.
   - `x` remains unchanged.

2. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - `x` remains the same as it defines the upper limit of the range.

3. **Adjustments:**
   - Since `i` at the end of the previous iteration is `i + 1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 2` because the loop increments `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration.
   - `x` should remain greater than 0 to ensure the loop can continue.

### Conclusion:
The state at the start of the next iteration should have `i` incremented by 1 from its end-of-iteration value, and `x` should remain the same.

State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `x` is greater than 0, and `l` is a list.**
