Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, and `p_i` != `i`; `x` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` takes an input from the user and `int()` converts it to an integer. The values of `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
