#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins. The second line contains a string s of length n, consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        s = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: - `data`: Remains unchanged.
    #   - `index`: After `t` iterations, `index` will have been incremented by 2 for each iteration, so `index` will be `1 + 2*t`.
    #   - `t`: Remains unchanged.
    #   - `results`: Will contain `t` elements, each 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether the count of 'U' in each corresponding string `s` is odd or even.
    #
    #Therefore, the output state after the loop completes all iterations is:
    #
    #Output State:
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `data` remains unchanged, `index` is `1 + 2*t`, `t` remains unchanged, and `results` remains unchanged with its elements printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of coins and their orientations ("U" for up, "D" for down). For each test case, it determines if the number of coins facing up is odd. If it is, the function outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".
