Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, where each string is a component of the original input string split by whitespace; `index` is 0; `t` is the integer value of the string at `data[0]`.**

In simple terms, `data` remains a list of strings, `index` stays at 0, and a new variable `t` is created and assigned the integer value of the first element in the `data` list.
