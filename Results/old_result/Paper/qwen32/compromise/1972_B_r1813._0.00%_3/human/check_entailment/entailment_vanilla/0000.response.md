Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining the winner of a game involving coins arranged in a circle. Alice and Bob take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins. The winner is the player who forces the opponent into a position where no facing-up coins are left.

The key insight to solving this problem is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins ('U') in the initial configuration. If the number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. This is because each move flips two coins, preserving the parity of the number of facing-up coins. If the initial count of 'U' coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position with an even number of 'U' coins, eventually leaving Bob with no moves. Conversely, if the initial count is even, Bob can mirror Alice's moves, ensuring Alice is left with no moves.

The provided program reads multiple test cases, counts the number of 'U' coins in each test case's string, and determines the winner based on the parity of this count. It appends 'YES' to the results list if the count is odd and 'NO' if it's even. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

The logic implemented in the program correctly reflects the solution strategy based on the parity of 'U' coins.

Correctness: **True**
