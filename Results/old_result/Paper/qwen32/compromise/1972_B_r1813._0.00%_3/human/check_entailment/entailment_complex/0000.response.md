### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the number of facing-up coins. The key insight is that Alice wins if and only if the number of facing-up coins is odd. This is because each move removes one facing-up coin and flips two adjacent coins, which can change the parity of the number of facing-up coins. If the number of facing-up coins starts as odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where the number of facing-up coins is even, and eventually, Bob will be left with no moves when the number of facing-up coins is zero.

The provided program correctly implements this logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of coins and the string representing their orientations.
3. It counts the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`).
4. It checks if the count of facing-up coins is odd. If it is, it appends `'YES'` to the results list; otherwise, it appends `'NO'`.
5. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Since the program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins, it is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
