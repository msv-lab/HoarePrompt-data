Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules described. The strategy and logic implemented in the program do not accurately reflect the optimal play for both players. 

The correct approach to solving this problem involves the concept of Nim-sum (XOR-sum) from combinatorial game theory. The game described is a variant of the Nim game where players remove the same number of stones from each non-empty pile. The key insight is that the game can be analyzed using the XOR of the pile sizes. If the XOR of all pile sizes is zero at the start, the second player (Bob) wins if both play optimally. Otherwise, the first player (Alice) wins.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    piles = list(map(int, input().split()))
    nim_sum = 0
    for pile in piles:
        nim_sum ^= pile
    if nim_sum == 0:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')
```

This program correctly calculates the Nim-sum of the pile sizes and determines the winner based on whether the Nim-sum is zero or not.
