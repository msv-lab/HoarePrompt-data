Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`nums`**: A list of 1s with the same length as the initial `nums`. This means if the original `nums` had a length of \( n \), the new `nums` will be a list containing \( n \) ones.
2. **`ls`**: The sum of the original `nums` list. If the original `nums` list had \( n \) elements, and assuming all elements were 1s, `ls` would be \( n \).
3. **`nw`**: A boolean variable set to `True`.
4. **`cw`**: A boolean variable set to `False`. However, the problem statement mentions that the current value of `cw` is `True`, which contradicts the initial state where `cw` is set to `False`. This creates a logically impossible scenario as per the given precondition.
5. **Print Statement**: `print('Alice')`

### Analysis:
The print statement `print('Alice')` is a straightforward print statement that outputs the string "Alice" regardless of the values of `nums`, `ls`, `nw`, or `cw`.

### Output:
Since the print statement is not dependent on the values of any variables or the logical consistency of the initial state, it will simply print the string "Alice".

Output: **Alice**
