The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range parameters `len(nums) - 2`, `0`, and `-1`. To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the range parameters and the value of `i`.

The loop will execute if the range has at least one valid index. The range `range(len(nums) - 2, 0, -1)` will produce indices starting from `len(nums) - 2` down to `1` (since the stop value is exclusive and the step is `-1`).

For the loop to execute, `len(nums) - 2` must be greater than or equal to `1`. This means `len(nums)` must be at least `3`.

The initial value of `i` before the loop starts is not directly relevant since it is set by the range function. However, we need to ensure that the range itself is valid.

Given the initial state:
- `nums` is a list of 1s with the same length as the initial `nums`
- `ls` is the sum of the original `nums` list
- `nw` is `True`
- `cw` is `True`

The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `nums` has a length of at least 3. This will make sure the range `range(len(nums) - 2, 0, -1)` is valid and the loop can execute.

State: **`nums` is a list of 1s with a length of at least 3, `ls` is the sum of the original `nums` list, `nw` is `True`, `cw` is `True`**
