Postcondition: **`nums` is a list of 1s with the same length as the initial `nums`, `ls` is the sum of the original `nums` list, `nw` is `True`, `cw` is `False` and the current value of `cw` is `True`. However, since the if condition checks if `cw` is `True`, this scenario is logically impossible given the precondition.**

Given the precondition, the `if (cw)` condition cannot be satisfied because `cw` is explicitly stated to be `False`. Therefore, the postcondition should reflect that the scenario where the if condition is true is logically inconsistent with the given precondition. However, if we were to hypothetically consider the condition being true despite the precondition, the postcondition would simply reflect that `cw` is `True`, which contradicts the initial state.
