Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of piles and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the given conditions.**
