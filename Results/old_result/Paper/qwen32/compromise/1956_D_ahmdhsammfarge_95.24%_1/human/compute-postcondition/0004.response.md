The code appends a new operation `[r + 1, r + 1]` to the `ops` list, regardless of the condition specified in the initial state. This means the value of `ops` will be updated to include this new operation. The values of `r`, `l`, `lst`, and the condition related to the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` are not affected by this specific line of code.

Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, and `ops` is a list that will store the operations performed, including the new operation `[r + 1, r + 1]`.**
