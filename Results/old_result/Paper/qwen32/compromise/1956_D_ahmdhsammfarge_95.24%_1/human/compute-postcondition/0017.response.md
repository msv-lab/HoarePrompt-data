The code snippet `over_sum = sm` assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. Given the initial state, `sm` is `sum(lst[3:]) + 9`. Therefore, after the execution of the code, `over_sum` will be equal to `sum(lst[3:]) + 9`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Hence, the output state is:

Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `r` is 0, `l` is 2, `over_sum` is `sum(lst[3:]) + 9`, `i` is 0, `sm` is `sum(lst[3:]) + 9`, `j` is 2.**
