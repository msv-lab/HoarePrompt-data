Postcondition: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements. `r` is 0. `l` is 1 if `sm > over_sum`, otherwise `l` remains 0. `over_sum` is `sum(lst[2:]) + 4` if `sm > over_sum`, otherwise `over_sum` remains the sum of the elements in `lst`. `i` is 0. `sm` is `sum(lst[2:]) + 4`. `j` is 1.**
