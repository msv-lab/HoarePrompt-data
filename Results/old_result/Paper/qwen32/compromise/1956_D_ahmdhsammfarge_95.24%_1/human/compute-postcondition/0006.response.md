The code appends the list `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list. This means that the `ops` list will now include this new operation. The values of `r`, `l`, and `lst` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, and `ops` is a list that includes the operations performed, including the new operation `[r + 1, r + 1]`.**
