To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
```

The variables in the loop head are `j`, `i`, and `len(lst)`.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **`i` and `len(lst)`**: 
   - The loop will iterate over the range starting from `i + 1` to `len(lst)`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i + 1` must be less than `len(lst)`. This means `i` must be less than `len(lst) - 1`.

2. **`j`**:
   - `j` is the loop variable and will take values from `i + 1` to `len(lst) - 1`.
   - Before the loop starts, `j` does not need to be initialized to a specific value because it will be set by the `range` function.

Given the initial state:
- `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements.
- `i` is `len(lst) - 1`.
- `j` is `len(lst) - 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust `i` so that `i + 1` is less than `len(lst)`. Since `lst` has at least 2 elements, `len(lst)` is at least 2. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to `len(lst) - 2` or any value less than `len(lst) - 1`.

However, since the task specifies only adjusting the state of objects in the loop head, and `len(lst)` is not a variable we can adjust directly, we focus on `i`.

State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(lst) - 2`, `j` is `len(lst) - 1`**

This adjustment ensures that `i + 1` is less than `len(lst)`, allowing the loop to execute.
