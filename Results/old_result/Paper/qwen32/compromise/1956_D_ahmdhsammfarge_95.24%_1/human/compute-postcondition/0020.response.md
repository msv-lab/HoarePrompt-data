The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `lst`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(lst) - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, but since `i` is already at the last index (`len(lst) - 1`), incrementing it would make it equal to `len(lst)`, which would terminate the loop.

Given the loop definition `for i in range(len(lst))`, the loop will iterate from `0` to `len(lst) - 1`. Since `i` is already `len(lst) - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next iteration would not occur because `i` would be out of the valid range.

Therefore, the loop will not execute one more time, and the state remains the same with `i` being `len(lst) - 1`.

State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `r` and `l` are the indices that maximize `sm`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` encountered, `i` is `len(lst) - 1`, `j` is `len(lst) - 1`**
