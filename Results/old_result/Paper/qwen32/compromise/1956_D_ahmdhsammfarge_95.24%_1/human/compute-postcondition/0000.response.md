The code snippet appends a list `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list. This means that the `ops` list will now include this new sublist. The values of `r` and `l` remain unchanged, and they still satisfy the condition `0 <= r <= l < len(lst)`. The list `lst` is also unchanged.

Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, and `ops` is a list that will store the operations performed, with the new operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` appended to it.**
