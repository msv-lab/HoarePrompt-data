To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop iterates over all possible pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j` and computes a value `sm` for each pair. The value `sm` is the sum of the elements in `lst` excluding the elements from index `i` to `j` plus the square of the length of the segment from `i` to `j` (inclusive). The loop keeps track of the maximum `sm` found and updates `r` and `l` to the indices `i` and `j` that maximize `sm`.

Here's a summary of the steps:

1. **Initialization**: `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, `r` and `l` are initialized to 0, and `over_sum` is the sum of all elements in `lst`.

2. **Outer Loop**: Iterates over each index `i` from 0 to `len(lst) - 2`.
3. **Inner Loop**: For each `i`, iterates over each index `j` from `i + 1` to `len(lst) - 1`.
4. **Calculation**: For each pair `(i, j)`, computes `sm` as the sum of elements before `i`, the sum of elements after `j`, plus `(j - i + 1) ** 2`.
5. **Update**: If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, updates `over_sum` to `sm` and sets `r` and `l` to `i` and `j`, respectively.

After all iterations, `r` and `l` will be the indices of the segment that maximizes `sm`, and `over_sum` will be the maximum `sm` found.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the final state after all iterations. The final state will be:

- `r` and `l` will be the indices of the segment that maximizes `sm`.
- `over_sum` will be the maximum `sm` found.

Since the loop considers all possible pairs `(i, j)`, the final state is the one where `sm` is maximized over all pairs.

**Output State: r and l are the indices that maximize sm, over_sum is the maximum value of sm encountered.**

In natural language: The final output state is that `r` and `l` are the starting and ending indices of the segment in the list `lst` that maximizes the computed value `sm`, and `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the execution of the loop.
