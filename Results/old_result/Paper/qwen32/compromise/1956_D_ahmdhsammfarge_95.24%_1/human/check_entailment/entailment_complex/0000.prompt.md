Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

    print(*r)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of non-negative integers, r and l are integers that will be used to store the indices of the subarray to be modified in the main function, over_sum is a variable used to keep track of the maximum sum calculated during the execution of the function.
def func_1(lst):
    r = l = 0
    over_sum = sum(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
            sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
            if sm > over_sum:
                r, l = [i, j]
                over_sum = sm
        
    #State: `r` and `l` are the indices `[i, j]` that maximize `sm`, and `over_sum` is the maximum `sm` found.
    return r, l
    #The program returns the indices `[i, j]` that maximize `sm`, where `r` is `i` and `l` is `j`. The maximum `sm` found is `over_sum`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of non-negative integers and returns a tuple of indices `[i, j]` that define a subarray. The subarray is chosen such that the sum of the elements outside the subarray plus the square of the length of the subarray is maximized.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: r and l are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < n, and ops is a list that will store the operations performed.
def func_2(r, l, ops):
    if (r == l) :
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: r and l are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < n, and ops is a list that will store the operations performed. Additionally, r is not equal to l
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes three parameters: `r` and `l`, which are integers satisfying 0 <= l <= r < n, and `ops`, which is a list that stores operations performed. It modifies the list `ops` by appending operations in a specific pattern based on the values of `r` and `l`. The function does not return anything.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: r and l are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), lst is a list of non-negative integers, and ops is a list that will store the operations performed.
def func_3(r, l, lst, ops):
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    if (min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0) :
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    #State: `r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, and `ops` is a list that will store the operations performed. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, the new operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` is appended to `ops`.
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst
    #The program returns the list `lst` where the elements from index `r` to `l` are all equal to `n`, and `n` is `l - r + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function modifies a list `lst` by setting all elements in the range from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) to the value `n`, where `n` is the length of the range (`l - r + 1`). It also records operations in the list `ops`. The function returns the modified list `lst`.
