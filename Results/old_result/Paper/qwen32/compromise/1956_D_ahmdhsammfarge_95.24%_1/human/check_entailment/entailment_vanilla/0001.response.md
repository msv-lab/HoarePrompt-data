Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the sum of an array by performing a specific operation that sets a subarray to the MEX (minimum excluded value) of that subarray. The operation can be performed up to 500,000 times.

### Program Analysis

The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.

#### Function 1: `func_1(lst)`
- This function is supposed to find the subarray `[i, j]` that, when set to its MEX, maximizes the sum of the array.
- It iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates a new sum `sm` if the subarray `[i, j]` is set to its MEX. However, the calculation of `sm` is incorrect. The MEX value is not used; instead, the sum is calculated as `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`. This formula does not represent the correct sum after setting the subarray to its MEX.
- The function returns the indices `r` and `l` of the subarray that results in the maximum sum according to the incorrect formula.

#### Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`
- This function is supposed to generate operations to set the subarray `[r, l]` to the MEX value.
- It recursively calls itself with the subarray `[r, l-1]` and adds operations to set the subarray `[r, l]` to the MEX value.
- However, the logic for generating operations is not correct and does not necessarily achieve the goal of setting the subarray to its MEX value.

#### Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`
- This function sets the subarray `[r, l]` to the MEX value and generates the corresponding operations.
- It adds operations to set the subarray `[r, l]` to the MEX value and then calls `func_2` to generate more operations.
- The subarray is set to the length of the subarray `n` instead of the MEX value, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly calculate the MEX value for any subarray and does not generate the correct operations to maximize the sum of the array. The logic in each function is flawed, and the program does not achieve the desired result.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
