You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers.

The median of an array q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_k is the number p_{\lceil
\frac{k}{2} \rceil} , where p is the array q sorted in non-decreasing order.
For example, the median of the array [9, 5, 1, 2, 6] is 5 , as in the sorted
array [1, 2, 5, 6, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 is 5
, and the median of the array [9, 2, 8, 3] is 3 , as in the sorted array [2,
3, 8, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 is 3 .

You are allowed to choose an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) and increase a_i by 1
in one operation.

Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the
median of the array.

Note that the array a may not necessarily contain distinct numbers.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations
required to increase the median of the array.

Note

In the first test case, you can apply one operation to the first number and
obtain the array [3, 2, 8] , the median of this array is 3 , as it is the
number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 3, 8] . The median of the original array [2, 2, 8] is 2 , as it is
the number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 2, 8] . Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in just one operation.

In the fourth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 2, 3 and obtain the array [6, 6, 6, 4, 5] , the median of this
array is 6 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 6, 6, 6] . The median of the original array
[5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil
= 2 in the non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 5, 5, 5] . Thus, the median
increased (6 > 5 ) in three operations. It can be shown that this is the
minimum possible number of operations.

In the fifth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 3 and obtain the array [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4] , the median of this
array is 3 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 4] . The median of the original
array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2 , as it is the number at index \lceil
\frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4] .
Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in two operations. It can be shown that
this is the minimum possible number of operations.

- Program:
def func():
    num = int(input())
    for i in range(0, num):
        num2 = int(input())
        case = input()
        op = 0
        if num2 > 10000:
            print(1)
            print(16668)
            break
        else:
            a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
            b = sorted(a)
            if num2 % 2 == 0:
                ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
            else:
                ma = int(num2 / 2)
            median = b[ma]
            new_median = median
            while new_median <= median:
                b[ma] += 1
                op += 1
                b = sorted(b)
                new_median = b[ma]
            print(op)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, if `n` is greater than 10,000, it outputs `1` followed by `16668`. Otherwise, it calculates the median of the list, increments the median until it exceeds its original value, counts the number of increments, and outputs this count.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `num2` and the array elements `case`.

2. **Handling Large Inputs:**
   - There's a special condition `if num2 > 10000:` which seems to be a hardcoded check and doesn't align with the problem constraints. This part of the code is unnecessary and potentially incorrect because the problem specifies `n` can be up to `10^5`, not `10000`. Also, the hardcoded outputs `print(1)` and `print(16668)` don't make sense in the context of the problem.

3. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program converts the input string `case` into a list of integers `a`.
   - It sorts the list `a` to get `b`.
   - It calculates the index of the median `ma` based on whether `num2` is even or odd.
   - It initializes `median` as the value at the median index in the sorted list `b`.

4. **Increasing the Median:**
   - The program enters a `while` loop where it increments the value at the median index `ma` in the sorted list `b` until the new median exceeds the original median.
   - It increments the operation count `op` each time it increases the median element.
   - After each increment, it resorts the list `b` to ensure the median is recalculated correctly from the updated list.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of operations `op` required to increase the median.

### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Handling of Large Inputs:** The hardcoded check for `num2 > 10000` is incorrect and should be removed.
- **Inefficient Sorting:** Resorting the list `b` inside the `while` loop is inefficient. Instead, we should maintain a min-heap or max-heap to efficiently track the median without resorting the entire list after each increment.
- **Logic Error in Incrementing Median:** The current logic of incrementing the median directly in the sorted list and resorting it is flawed. We need to consider the effect of increasing an element on the median position in the original unsorted list.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, particularly the incorrect handling of large inputs and inefficient sorting, the program is not correct.
