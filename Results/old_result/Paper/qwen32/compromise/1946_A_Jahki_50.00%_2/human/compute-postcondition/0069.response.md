The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4;
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5;
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9;
- `num` is greater than 0;
- `num2` is an input integer;
- `case` is the input string;
- `i` is incremented by 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1. To prepare for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 again, making it ready for the next loop cycle.

Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head, we adjust `i` accordingly.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer; `case` is the input string; `i` is incremented by 1 (meaning `i` is now `i + 1` from the previous state)**

To be more precise, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer; `case` is the input string; `i` is `i + 1`**
