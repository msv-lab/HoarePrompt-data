To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while new_median <= median:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will continue as long as `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to make sure that `new_median` remains less than or equal to `median`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4;
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5;
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`;
- `num` is greater than 0;
- `num2` is an input integer that is less than or equal to 10000;
- `case` is the input string;
- `op` is 1;
- `b` is the fully sorted list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1 and placed in the correct sorted position;
- `median` is `b[ma]`;
- `new_median` is `b[ma]`.

Since `median` and `new_median` are both set to `b[ma]` at the end of the previous iteration, the condition `new_median <= median` is satisfied (because they are equal).

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to maintain this condition. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for the values of `median` and `new_median` themselves, as they are already equal and satisfy the loop condition.

Thus, the state remains the same:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer that is less than or equal to 10000; `case` is the input string; `op` is 1; `b` is the fully sorted list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1 and placed in the correct sorted position; `median` is `b[ma]`; `new_median` is `b[ma]`**
