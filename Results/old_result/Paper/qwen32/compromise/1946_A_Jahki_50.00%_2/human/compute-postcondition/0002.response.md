Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `num` must be greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The value of `num2` is set to whatever integer is provided by the input. All other variables retain their initial values and constraints.
