Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer; `case` is the input string; `op` is 3; `i` is incremented by 1; `b` is the sorted list of integers derived from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1; `median` is `b[ma]` before the increment; `new_median` is `b[ma]` after the increment and must be greater than `median`. `b[ma]` is now `new_median`, which is `median + 1`.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that the value of `op` has been incremented by 1, making it 3. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
