The given code snippet sorts the list `b`. Since `b` was already sorted with `b[ma]` incremented by 1, sorting it again does not change its order. Therefore, the only thing that changes is that `b` remains sorted, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer; `case` is the input string; `op` is 2; `i` is incremented by 1; `b` is the sorted list of integers derived from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1; `median` is `b[ma]` before the increment; `new_median` is `b[ma]` after the increment and must be greater than `median`**.
