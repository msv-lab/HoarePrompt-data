To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables and how many times it runs.

### Key Points:
- The loop runs `num` times.
- For each iteration, it reads an integer `num2` and a string `case`.
- If `num2` is greater than 10000, it prints `1` and `16668`, then breaks out of the loop.
- Otherwise, it processes the string `case` to form a list of integers `a`, sorts it to get `b`, finds the median, and increments the median until it becomes greater than the original median, counting the number of increments (`op`).

### Given Information:
- After the first iteration, `op` is calculated based on the input `num2` and `case`.
- After the second iteration, `op` is again calculated similarly.
- After the third iteration, `op` is calculated similarly.

### Generalization:
- The loop will continue until either `num` iterations are completed or `num2` exceeds 10000 in any iteration.

### Final Output State:
- `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- `num` remains unchanged as it controls the number of iterations.
- `i` will be equal to `num` unless the loop breaks due to `num2 > 10000`.
- `op` will be the sum of the operations performed in each iteration where `num2` was not greater than 10000.
- `num2` and `case` will hold the values from the last iteration.
- `b`, `ma`, `median`, and `new_median` will hold the values from the last iteration where `num2` was not greater than 10000.

### Conclusion:
The final output state will reflect the cumulative effect of all iterations up to the point where the loop terminates.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `num` is an integer representing the total number of intended iterations; `i` is equal to `num` if no `num2` exceeded 10000, otherwise it is the iteration count before breaking; `op` is the total number of increments performed across all iterations where `num2` was not greater than 10000; `num2` and `case` are the values from the last iteration; `b`, `ma`, `median`, and `new_median` are the values from the last iteration where `num2` was not greater than 10000.**
