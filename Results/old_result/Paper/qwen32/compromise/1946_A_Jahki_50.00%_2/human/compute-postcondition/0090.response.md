Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers parsed from the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer; `case` is the input string; `i` is `i + 1`; `op` is 2; `b` is the sorted version of `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 2; `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`; `median` is `b[ma] - 2`; `new_median` is `b[ma] - 2`.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that the variable `op` has been incremented by 1, making its new value 2. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
