To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `new_median <= median` is true. This means we need to adjust the values of `new_median` and `median` accordingly.

Given the conditions:
- `new_median` is the value of `b[ma]` after the last increment, which is greater than `median`.
- `median` is the value of `b[ma]` before the last increment.

For the loop to execute, `new_median` should be less than or equal to `median`. However, based on the provided information, `new_median` is always greater than `median` after the increment. Therefore, we need to reverse this relationship to satisfy the loop condition.

Here’s how we can adjust the state:

1. Ensure that `new_median` is set to a value that is less than or equal to `median`.

Since `new_median` is derived from `b[ma]` after incrementing, and `median` is the value of `b[ma]` before the increment, we need to adjust `b[ma]` such that after the increment, `new_median` is still less than or equal to `median`. This can be achieved by setting `b[ma]` to a value that remains unchanged after the increment, or by ensuring that the increment does not occur, which would mean `new_median` equals `median`.

However, since the problem specifies that `new_median` is incremented until it is greater than `median`, we need to reverse this logic to make the loop condition true initially. The simplest way to do this is to set `new_median` to be equal to `median` initially, bypassing the increment logic that makes `new_median` greater than `median`.

Therefore, we adjust the state such that `new_median` is equal to `median`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer; `case` is the input string; `op` is 0; `i` is incremented by 1; `b` is the sorted list of integers derived from `a`; `median` is `b[ma]`; `new_median` is equal to `median`**
