Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `tests` is 1.
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.
   - `a` and `b` are input strings.
   - `c` is the input string.
   - `slength` is an input integer.
   - `no` is True (since `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`).
   - `i` is set to `len(c) + 1`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('NO')
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The print statement `print('NO')` is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `tests`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `slength`, `no`, or `i`.
   - The string `'NO'` is explicitly provided in the print statement.

4. **Output:**
   - The output will be the string `'NO'` as it is directly specified in the print statement.

Therefore, the output of the code will be:

Output: **NO**
