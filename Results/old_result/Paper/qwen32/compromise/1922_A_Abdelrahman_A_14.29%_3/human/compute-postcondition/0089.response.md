Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` and `b` are input strings, `c` is the input string, `slength` is an input integer, `no` is True if `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, and `i` is set to `len(c) + 1`. If `c` is equal to `a` or `c` is equal to `b`, `no` is False and `i` remains `len(c) + 1`.**
