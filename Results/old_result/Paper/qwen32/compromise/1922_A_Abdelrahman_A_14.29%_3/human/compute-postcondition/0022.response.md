The only variable in the loop head is `x`, which is the loop variable iterating over the string `c`. To execute the loop one more time, `x` needs to be updated to the next character in the string `c`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `tests` is 1
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20
- `a` is an input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters
- `b` is the new input string
- `c` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters
- `i` is 0
- `slength` is an input integer
- `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`
- `x` is the second character in `c`

Since `x` is the second character in `c` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `x` should be the third character in `c`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is an input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the new input string, `c` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 0, `slength` is an input integer, and `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`. `x` is the third character in `c`**
