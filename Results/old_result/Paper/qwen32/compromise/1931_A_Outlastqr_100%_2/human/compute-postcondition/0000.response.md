The code snippet `alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase` assigns the string of all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z' to the variable `alphabet`. This does not affect the values of `t` or `n`, which are still within their specified ranges.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**.
