To determine the output state after the loop executes all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables and what gets printed in each iteration. The loop reads an integer `t` (the number of iterations) and then for each iteration, it reads an integer `n` and constructs a string `word` based on the value of `n`. The constructed `word` is then printed.

The initial state provided includes:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.
- `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.

The loop modifies the variable `n` and constructs the variable `word` in each iteration. However, the value of `t` and the `alphabet` string remain unchanged throughout the loop execution. The output of the loop is the series of printed words.

Since the loop prints `word` in each iteration and does not modify `t` or `alphabet`, the final output state will reflect the unchanged values of `t` and `alphabet` and the printed words for each iteration.

Given the format requirement, the output state description should reflect the unchanged values of `t` and `alphabet` and the fact that the loop has printed a series of words.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, alphabet is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and the loop has printed a series of words based on the input values of n in each iteration.**
