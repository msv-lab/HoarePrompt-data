Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect based on the problem description. The program calculates the number of fireworks visible in the sky by simply summing the number of times fireworks from each installation are visible within the duration `m` and then adding 2. This approach does not account for the overlap of visibility periods between fireworks from the two installations, which can lead to incorrect results.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of overlapping fireworks and ensure we count overlapping periods correctly. The correct approach involves calculating the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the duration `m` and adjusting for overlaps.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)  # Calculate LCM of a and b
        
        # Number of fireworks launched by each installation within duration m
        fireworks_a = (m + a - 1) // a
        fireworks_b = (m + b - 1) // b
        
        # Number of overlapping fireworks (both installations launch at the same time)
        fireworks_overlap = (m + lcm_ab - 1) // lcm_ab
        
        # Maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time
        max_fireworks = fireworks_a + fireworks_b - fireworks_overlap
        
        print(max_fireworks)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected function calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation and subtracts the overlaps to get the correct count of fireworks visible at the same time.

Correctness: **False**
