### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program is incorrect. The function `func()` simply adds the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period plus 2, which does not account for overlaps between fireworks from both installations.

To correctly determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period.
2. Account for the overlaps between fireworks from both installations, which can be determined using the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
3. Calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time by adding the fireworks from both installations and subtracting the overlaps.

The corrected version of the program provided in the original assessment properly accounts for these factors and should work for all test cases as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
