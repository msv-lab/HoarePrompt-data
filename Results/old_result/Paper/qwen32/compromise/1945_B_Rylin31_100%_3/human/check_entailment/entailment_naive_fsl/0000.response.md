Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. The current implementation simply adds the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period plus 2, which is incorrect and does not account for overlaps between fireworks from both installations.

For example, consider the test case `a = 6`, `b = 7`, `m = 4`. The program would output `m // a + m // b + 2 = 4 // 6 + 4 // 7 + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2`. However, this is incorrect because it does not account for the simultaneous visibility of fireworks launched at specific times.

Let's break down the correct approach:

1. **Calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period**:
   - For the first installation: `m // a + 1` (since the last firework launched could be at `m`).
   - For the second installation: `m // b + 1`.

2. **Account for overlapping fireworks**:
   - The fireworks from both installations can overlap if their launch times coincide within the visibility period. This is determined by the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
   - The number of overlapping fireworks is `m // lcm(a, b) + 1`.

3. **Calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time**:
   - This is the sum of the fireworks from both installations minus the overlaps (since they are counted twice).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        fireworks_a = m // a + 1
        fireworks_b = m // b + 1
        overlap = m // lcm_ab + 1
        max_fireworks = fireworks_a + fireworks_b - overlap
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

This corrected program properly accounts for the overlaps and should work for all test cases as described in the problem statement.
