### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to determine the winner of the game based on the unique stone counts across all test cases. However, the logic in the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the rules of the game described in the problem statement.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Game Rules Recap**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns removing stones from piles.
   - Each turn, they remove `k` stones from each non-empty pile, where `k` is a positive integer and at most the size of the smallest non-empty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The game essentially boils down to the number of piles with stones. If the number of piles with stones is odd, Alice wins because she can always force Bob into a position where the number of piles with stones is even. Conversely, if the number of piles with stones is even, Bob wins because Alice will always leave an even number of piles for Bob.
   - This is because the game is symmetric and the only way to reduce the number of piles is by removing stones from all non-empty piles, which will always change the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of piles.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The current implementation checks the unique stone counts and their differences, which is not relevant to the game's outcome as described.
   - The program does not actually count the number of non-empty piles or track the game state properly.

### Correctness:
Given the mismatch between the problem's rules and the program's logic, the provided program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
