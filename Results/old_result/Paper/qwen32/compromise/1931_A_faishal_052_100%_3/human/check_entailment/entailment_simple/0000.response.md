### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to decode an integer back into the lexicographically smallest possible three-letter word based on the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the encoded sum of the positions of the letters.

2. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` for each test case.
   - It then enters a loop that runs twice (for `j` in range(2)):
     - If `lex` (which is the current value of `n`) is less than 28, it appends `1` to `arr` and subtracts `1` from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is between 28 and 51, it appends `26` to `arr` and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is between 52 and 78, it again appends `26` to `arr` and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - The list `arr` is then sorted.

3. **Generating Output:**
   - For each test case, the program constructs a string `temp` by converting each element in `arr` to its corresponding character using `chr(element + 96)` (since 'a' corresponds to ASCII 97).
   - It prints the constructed string `temp`.

### Issues with the Provided Logic:
- The decoding logic does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word. Specifically, the approach of appending `1` or `26` based on the value of `lex` and then sorting the list does not ensure that the resulting word is the smallest possible.
- For example, consider the input `24`. The program might generate `[1, 1, 22]` and sort it to `[1, 1, 22]` which corresponds to "aab". However, the correct output should be "aav".
- The logic needs to be adjusted to always choose the smallest possible letters first, ensuring the lexicographical order.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified above, the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to find the lexicographically smallest word.

**Correctness: False**

To fix the program, a more appropriate approach would involve iteratively choosing the smallest possible letter for each position while ensuring the sum matches the given encoded value.
