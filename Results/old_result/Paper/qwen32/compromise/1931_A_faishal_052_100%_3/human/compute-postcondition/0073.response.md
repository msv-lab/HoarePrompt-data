The code appends `1` to the list `arr`. Since the initial state specifies that `info` contains one sublist which is `arr` with an additional element appended based on the value of `lex`, appending `1` to `arr` will change the structure of `info`.

Given the conditions for `lex`:
- If `lex` < 28, `arr` already had `1` appended to it.
- If 28 <= `lex` <= 78, `arr` already had `26` appended to it.
- If `lex` > 78, `arr` was unchanged.

After appending `1` to `arr`, the new `info` will have `arr` with an additional `1` appended regardless of the initial condition for `lex`.

The values of `cases`, `lex`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr` with an additional `1` appended to it, `lex` is `lex - 1` if `lex` < 28, `lex - 26` if 28 <= `lex` < 52 or 52 < `lex` <= 78, or unchanged if `lex` > 78, and `j` is 1.**
