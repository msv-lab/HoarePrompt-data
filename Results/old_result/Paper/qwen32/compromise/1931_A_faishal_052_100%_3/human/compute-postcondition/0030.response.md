The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2, but since the loop condition checks if `j` is less than 2, the loop will terminate after this iteration.

However, if we strictly follow the instruction to adjust the state for the start of the next iteration (even though it won't execute), we would increment `j` by 1.

State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is an empty list, `j` is 2**
