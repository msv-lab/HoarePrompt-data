To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for j in range(2):
```

This means the only variable we can adjust is `j`, and the range function indicates that the loop will iterate as long as `j` is less than 2.

Given the initial state:
- `cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100
- `info` is a list containing two sublists (the first being the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second being `arr`)
- `lex` is the integer value obtained from the input
- `j` is 1
- `i` is 2
- `arr` is an empty list

We need to ensure that the loop can execute. Since the loop iterates over `range(2)`, `j` should start from 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `j` is 0.

State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing two sublists (the first being the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second being `arr`), `lex` is the integer value obtained from the input, `j` is 0, `i` is 2, `arr` is an empty list**
