The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `cases`. If `i` is less than `cases`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2.

The other variables (`cases`, `info`, `lex`, and `j`) are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing two sublists (the first being the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second being `arr`), `lex` is adjusted based on the initial value of `lex`, and `j` is 1, `i` is 2**
