The code snippet modifies the variable `temp` by appending another character to it. The new character is determined by the value of `info[i][j] + 96`, which is then converted to a character using the `chr` function.

Given the initial state:
- `temp` is initially `chr(info[3][2] + 96)`
- `i` is 3
- `j` is 2

The code modifies `temp` to be `temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)`. Since `i` is 3 and `j` is 2, this translates to `temp + chr(info[3][2] + 96)`.

Since `temp` was already initialized to `chr(info[3][2] + 96)`, the new value of `temp` will be the concatenation of `chr(info[3][2] + 96)` with itself, effectively doubling the character represented by `info[3][2] + 96`.

Therefore, the updated `temp` will be `chr(info[3][2] + 96) + chr(info[3][2] + 96)`.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, `lex` is adjusted based on the described rules for each test case, `temp` is `chr(info[3][2] + 96) + chr(info[3][2] + 96)`, `j` is 2, `i` is 3**.
