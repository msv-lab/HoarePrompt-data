Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr` with an additional element `1` appended to it, `lex` is an integer, and `j` is 0.**

Natural Language: The `arr` sublist within the `info` list now includes an additional element `1`. All other variables (`cases`, `lex`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
