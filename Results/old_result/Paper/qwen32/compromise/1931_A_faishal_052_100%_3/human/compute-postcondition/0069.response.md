Postcondition: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr` with `26` appended to it if `lex` <= 78, otherwise `info` remains unchanged as a list containing one sublist which is `arr`. `lex` is an integer minus 26 if `lex` <= 78, otherwise `lex` remains unchanged. `j` is 0.**
