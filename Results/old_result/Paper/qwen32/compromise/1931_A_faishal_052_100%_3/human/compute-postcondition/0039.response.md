Postcondition: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `j` is 2, and `info` is a list. If `lex` was initially less than 28, `info` contains the element `[1]`. If `lex` was initially between 28 and 51, `info` remains an empty list. If `lex` was initially between 52 and 78, `info` contains the element `[26]` and `lex` is updated to `lex_initial - 26`. If `lex` was initially greater than 78, `info` remains an empty list.**
