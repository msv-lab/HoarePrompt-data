Postcondition: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr` with `26` appended to it if `lex` <= 78, and `lex` is adjusted to `lex - 26` if `lex` < 52, `lex - 52` if 52 <= `lex` < 78, or remains unchanged if `lex` > 78. If `lex` > 78, `info` remains unchanged. In all cases, `j` is 1.**
