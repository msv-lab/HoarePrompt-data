Postcondition: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is an empty list, `j` is 1. If `lex` was originally less than 28, `lex` is updated to `lex - 1` and `arr` is a list containing the element 1. If `lex` was originally between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `lex` is updated to `lex - 26` and `arr` is a list containing the element 26. If `lex` was originally between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `lex` is updated to `lex - 26` and `arr` is a list containing the element 26. If `lex` was originally greater than 78, `lex` remains unchanged and `arr` is an empty list.**
