In the given for loop:

```python
for j in range(3):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop variable is `j`, and the range is from 0 to 2 (inclusive). The initial value of `j` before the loop starts is irrelevant because it will be set to 0 at the beginning of the first iteration.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100
- `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists
- `lex` is adjusted based on the described rules for each test case
- `temp` is an empty string
- `j` is 3
- `i` is 4

Only the variable `j` in the loop head can be adjusted. Since the loop will set `j` to 0, 1, and 2 during its iterations, the initial value of `j` (which is 3) does not affect the loop's execution. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `j` to ensure the loop executes.

Thus, the state remains as provided, except that we note the loop will control `j` itself.

State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, `lex` is adjusted based on the described rules for each test case, `temp` is an empty string, `j` is 3 (but will be controlled by the loop), `i` is 4**
