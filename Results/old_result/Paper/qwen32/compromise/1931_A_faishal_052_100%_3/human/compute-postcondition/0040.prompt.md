Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is an empty list, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex < 28:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    elif lex <= 78:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is an empty list, `lex` is an integer, and `arr` is a list. If `lex` was originally less than 28, then `lex` is decreased by 1 and `arr` contains the single element [1] if the new `lex` is less than 27. Otherwise, if `lex` is less than 26, `arr` contains the integer 26. If `lex` is between 26 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` remains an empty list. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` contains the integer 26. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is an empty list, `j` is 1. If `lex` was originally less than 28, `lex` is updated to `lex - 1` and `arr` is a list containing the element 1. If `lex` was originally between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `lex` is updated to `lex - 26` and `arr` is a list containing the element 26. If `lex` was originally between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `lex` is updated to `lex - 26` and `arr` is a list containing the element 26. If `lex` was originally greater than 78, `lex` remains unchanged and `arr` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `j` is 2, and `info` is a list. If `lex` was initially less than 28, `info` contains the element `[1]`. If `lex` was initially between 28 and 51, `info` remains an empty list. If `lex` was initially between 52 and 78, `info` contains the element `[26]` and `lex` is updated to `lex_initial - 26`. If `lex` was initially greater than 78, `info` remains an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
