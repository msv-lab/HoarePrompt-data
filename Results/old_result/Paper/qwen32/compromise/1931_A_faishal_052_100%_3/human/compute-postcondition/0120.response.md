The given code snippet decreases the value of `lex` by 26. Based on the initial state, `lex` is already defined such that it is decreased by 1 if it is less than 28, otherwise it is decreased by 26. Since the code snippet explicitly decreases `lex` by 26, we will apply this operation.

Given that `lex` was initially decreased by either 1 or 26 based on its value, after executing `lex = lex - 26`, the new value of `lex` will be further reduced by 26 from its already adjusted state.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing two sublists (the first being the updated `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second being the updated `arr` with `26` appended to it), `j` is 0, `i` is 2, and `lex` is decreased by an additional 26 from its previously adjusted value.**

In simpler terms, `lex` has been decreased by an additional 26 from whatever value it had after the initial adjustment. All other variables remain unchanged.
