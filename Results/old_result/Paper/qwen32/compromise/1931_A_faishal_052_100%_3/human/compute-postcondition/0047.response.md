To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the given `for` loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for j in range(2):
```

From this, we can see that the variable `j` is the loop variable, and the range is from 0 to 1 (inclusive). Therefore, the loop will execute exactly twice if the range is correctly defined.

Let's analyze the provided state and identify which parts need adjustment:

- `cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100.
- `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr`.
- `arr` is an empty list.
- `lex` is an input integer.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

None of these variables (`cases`, `info`, `arr`, `lex`, `i`) are directly involved in the loop head. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The only requirement for the loop to execute is that the range function is correctly set up, which it is in this case (`range(2)`).

Thus, no adjustments are needed to the provided state for the loop to execute. Here is the final state:

State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr`, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer, `i` is `i + 1`**
