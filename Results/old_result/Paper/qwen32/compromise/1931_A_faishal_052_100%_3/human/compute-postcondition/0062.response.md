The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 1`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the outer loop (not shown here), we need to set `j` to 0 to start the inner loop again.

The states of `cases`, `info`, `lex`, and `arr` should remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr`, `lex` is an integer, and `j` is 0**
