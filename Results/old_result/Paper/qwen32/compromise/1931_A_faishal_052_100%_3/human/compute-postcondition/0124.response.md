To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to carefully analyze the given loop and its conditions. The loop runs for `j` in the range of 2, meaning it will execute exactly twice. Let's break down the possible outcomes based on the value of `lex`:

### Loop Execution Analysis

#### First Iteration (j = 0):
- If `lex < 28`, append `1` to `arr` and decrement `lex` by `1`.
- If `28 <= lex < 52`, append `26` to `arr` and decrement `lex` by `26`.
- If `52 <= lex <= 78`, append `26` to `arr` and decrement `lex` by `26`.

#### Second Iteration (j = 1):
- Repeat the same checks as the first iteration based on the updated value of `lex`.

### Final Output State Calculation

After the loop completes, `j` will be `1` (since the loop runs for `j` in `range(2)`). The value of `i` remains `2` throughout the loop as it is not modified inside the loop.

Let's consider the different ranges of `lex`:

1. **If `lex < 28` initially:**
   - After first iteration: `arr = [1]`, `lex = lex - 1`
   - After second iteration: `arr = [1, 1]` if `lex - 1 < 28`; otherwise, `arr = [1, 26]` if `28 <= lex - 1 < 52`; or `arr = [1, 26]` if `52 <= lex - 1 <= 78`

2. **If `28 <= lex < 52` initially:**
   - After first iteration: `arr = [26]`, `lex = lex - 26`
   - After second iteration: `arr = [26, 1]` if `lex - 26 < 28`; otherwise, `arr = [26, 26]` if `28 <= lex - 26 < 52`; or `arr = [26, 26]` if `52 <= lex - 26 <= 78`

3. **If `52 <= lex <= 78` initially:**
   - After first iteration: `arr = [26]`, `lex = lex - 26`
   - After second iteration: `arr = [26, 1]` if `lex - 26 < 28`; otherwise, `arr = [26, 26]` if `28 <= lex - 26 < 52`; or `arr = [26, 26]` if `52 <= lex - 26 <= 78`

4. **If `lex > 78` initially:**
   - After first iteration: `arr = [26]`, `lex = lex - 26`
   - After second iteration: `arr = [26, 26]` if `lex - 26 >= 52`; otherwise, `arr = [26, 1]` if `lex - 26 < 28`; or `arr = [26, 26]` if `28 <= lex - 26 < 52`

### Conclusion

The final state of `arr` depends on the initial value of `lex`. However, the loop will always run exactly twice, and `j` will end up being `1`. The value of `i` remains `2`.

### Output State

The final output state can be described as follows:

- `cases` remains the same.
- `info` will contain two sublists:
  - The first sublist is the sorted `arr` with the final value of `lex` appended.
  - The second sublist is the final `arr`.
- `j` will be `1`.
- `i` will be `2`.

Given the loop's behavior, the exact contents of `arr` depend on the initial value of `lex`, but the structure of `info` and the values of `j` and `i` are fixed.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing two sublists (the first being the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second being `arr`), `j` is 1, `i` is 2.**
