Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing two sublists (the first being the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second being `arr`), `lex` is the integer value obtained from the input minus 26 and is greater than or equal to 26 but less than or equal to 52, `j` is 0, `i` is 2, `arr` is [26]**.

In natural language: The value of `lex` has been decreased by 26, so it is now between 26 and 52 inclusive. All other variables remain unchanged.
