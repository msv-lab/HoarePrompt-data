Postcondition: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr` with an additional element `1` appended to it if `lex` < 28, or with `26` appended to it if 28 <= `lex` <= 78, or unchanged if `lex` > 78, `lex` is `lex - 1` if `lex` < 28, `lex - 26` if 28 <= `lex` < 52 or 52 < `lex` <= 78, or unchanged if `lex` > 78, and `j` is 0.**
