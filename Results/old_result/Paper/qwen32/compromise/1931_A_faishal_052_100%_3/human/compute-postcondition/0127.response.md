The code appends the `arr` list to the `info` list. Since `arr` is already the fully sorted list from `info[0]`, appending it again means `info` will now contain three sublists: the first being the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, the second being `arr`, and the third also being `arr`.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing three sublists (the first being the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, the second being `arr`, and the third being `arr`), `j` is 1, `i` is 2, `arr` is the fully sorted list from `info[0]`.**
