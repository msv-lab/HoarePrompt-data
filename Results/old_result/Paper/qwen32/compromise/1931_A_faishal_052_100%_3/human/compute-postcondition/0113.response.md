Postcondition: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing two sublists (the first being the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second being `arr` with either 1 appended to it if `lex` < 28, or 26 appended to it if `lex` > 78, or just `arr` if 28 <= `lex` <= 78), `j` is 1, `i` is 2, and `lex` is decreased by 1 if `lex` < 28, otherwise `lex` is decreased by 26.**
