The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `cases`. If `i` is less than `cases`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4. The value of `cases` remains unchanged as it defines the total number of iterations the loop should perform.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, `lex` is adjusted based on the described rules for each test case, `temp` is `chr(info[3][0] + 96) + chr(info[3][1] + 96) + chr(info[3][2] + 96)`, `j` is 3, `i` is 4**
