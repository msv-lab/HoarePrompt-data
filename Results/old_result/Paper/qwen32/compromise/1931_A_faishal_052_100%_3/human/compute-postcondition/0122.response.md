Postcondition: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing two sublists (the first being the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second being `arr` with either [1, 26] appended to it if `lex` was originally less than 28, [26, 26] appended to it if `lex` was originally greater than 78, or just `arr` with `26` appended to it if 28 <= `lex` <= 78), `j` is 0, `i` is 2, and `lex` is decreased by 26 from its adjusted value. If `lex` >= 52, `lex` is further decreased by 26 if `lex` <= 78.**
