The code appends the list `arr` to the list `info`. This means that `info` now contains two sublists: the first one is the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second one is just `arr`.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing two sublists (the first being the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second being `arr`), `lex` is adjusted based on the initial value of `lex`, and `j` is 1.**
