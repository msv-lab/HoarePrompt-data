Postcondition: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing two sublists (the first being the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second being `arr` with either `1` appended to it if `lex` was originally less than 28, `26` appended to it if 28 <= `lex` <= 78, or `[26, 26]` appended to it if `lex` was originally greater than 78), `j` is 0, `i` is 2, and `lex` is decreased by 1 if it was originally less than 28, and decreased by 26 otherwise. If `lex` was originally greater than 78, it is further decreased by 26 if it is now between 52 and 78 inclusive.**
