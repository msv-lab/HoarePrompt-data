The given initial state describes the values and conditions of some variables before the `print` statement is executed. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

- `possible` is set to `False`.
- `t` is decremented by 1, but this does not affect the `print` statement as `t` is not referenced in it.
- `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, but they are also not referenced in the `print` statement.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('NO')
```
This statement prints the string `'NO'` directly. The values of `possible`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` do not influence the output of this `print` statement since they are not used within it.

Output: **NO**
