The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the variables' values or any conditions outside the loop. Since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the conditions mentioned in the initial state.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `b` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `c` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `possible` is False; `i` is 0; the character at index `i` of `a` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `b`; the character at index `i` of `c` is equal to the character at index `i` of `a` or the character at index `i` of `c` is equal to the character at index `i` of `b`.**
