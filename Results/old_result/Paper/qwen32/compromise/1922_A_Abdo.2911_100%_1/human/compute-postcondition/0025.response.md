Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is 1. If `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, then `possible` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `possible` remains undetermined.**
