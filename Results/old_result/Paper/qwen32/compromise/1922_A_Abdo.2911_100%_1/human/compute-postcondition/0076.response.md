The code snippet sets the variable `possible` to `True`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `possible` while keeping the other variables in their initial state.

Output State: **`possible` is True, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the stripped input values, and `i` is `i + 1`**.
