Postcondition: **`possible` is determined by the condition, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the stripped input values, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
