Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `b` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `c` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `possible` is True; `i` is 0; the character at index `i` of `a` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `b`; and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables remain unchanged, but we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
