The code assigns the value of `input().strip()` to the variable `a`. This means `a` will hold the input string with any leading or trailing whitespace removed. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.**
