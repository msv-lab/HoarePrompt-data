The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables directly. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, and `possible` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is 1; `possible` is undetermined**.
