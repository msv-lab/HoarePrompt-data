Postcondition: **`possible` is a boolean. If `possible` is `True`, it means that at some index `i`, either `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]`, or `c[i]` is equal to `b[i]`. If `possible` is `False`, it means that for every index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, either `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is also equal to `a[i]`, or `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`.**
