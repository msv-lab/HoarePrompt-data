Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` (with `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`). For each test case, it determines if there exists at least one position `i` where the character in `c` is different from the characters in both `a` and `b` at the same position. If such a position exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.**
