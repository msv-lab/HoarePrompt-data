To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic in detail using the problem description and the function summary.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that:
- Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
- String `c` does not match the template `t`.

### Template Matching Rules:
- If `t[i]` is lowercase, `s[i]` must be the same as `t[i]`.
- If `t[i]` is uppercase, `s[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **When `a[i] == b[i]`:**
   - For `a` and `b` to match the template, `t[i]` must be an uppercase letter different from `a[i]`/`b[i]`.
   - For `c` not to match, `c[i]` must be the same as `a[i]`/`b[i]`.

2. **When `a[i] != b[i]`:**
   - For `a` and `b` to match the template, `t[i]` can be either `a[i]` (uppercase) or `b[i]` (uppercase).
   - For `c` not to match, `c[i]` must be either `a[i]` or `b[i]`.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The provided program iterates through each character position `i` in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` and checks the following:
- If `a[i] == b[i]`, it checks if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`. If so, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks the loop.
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, it checks if `c[i]` is either the same as `a[i]` or `b[i]`. If not, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks the loop.

### Issues in the Provided Program:
The main issue is that the program's logic does not ensure that a valid template `t` can be constructed for all positions `i` in the strings. Specifically:
- When `a[i] == b[i]`, the program only checks if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`. However, it does not ensure that `t[i]` can be an uppercase letter different from `a[i]`.
- When `a[i] != b[i]`, the program only checks if `c[i]` is either the same as `a[i]` or `b[i]`. However, it does not ensure that `t[i]` can be either `a[i]` (uppercase) or `b[i]` (uppercase).

### Correct Logic:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that for each position `i`, there exists a valid `t[i]` that satisfies the conditions for `a`, `b`, and `c`:
- When `a[i] == b[i]`, `t[i]` must be an uppercase letter different from `a[i]`. If `c[i]` is the same as `a[i]`, then no valid `t[i]` exists.
- When `a[i] != b[i]`, `t[i]` can be either `a[i]` (uppercase) or `b[i]` (uppercase). If `c[i]` is either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, then no valid `t[i]` exists.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        possible = True
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                if c[i] == a[i]:
                    possible = False
                    break
            else:
                if c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
                    possible = False
                    break
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func_1()
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **correct**. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. The corrected program ensures that a valid template `t` can be constructed for all positions `i` in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

**Final: False**
