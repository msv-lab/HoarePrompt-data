The code snippet `s += chr(j + ord('a'))` appends a character to the string `s`. The character is determined by converting `j + ord('a')` to a character using `chr()`. Given that `j` is initially 2, `chr(2 + ord('a'))` will be `chr(2 + 97)` which is `chr(99)`, and `chr(99)` corresponds to the character 'c'. Thus, the string `s` will have 'c' appended to it.

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `j`, `char_count`) remain unchanged as they are not modified in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n); `s` is a string with 'c' appended to it; If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, then `s` is "b" and `char_count[1]` is 1, otherwise `s` remains an empty string and `char_count` remains a list of 26 zeros; `j` is 2. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
