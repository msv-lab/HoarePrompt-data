The only variable in the loop head is `j`. The loop iterates from 0 to 25 (inclusive), meaning `j` ranges from 0 to 25. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n); `s` is a string. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, then `s` is "b" and `char_count[1]` is 1, otherwise `s` remains an empty string and `char_count` remains a list of 26 zeros. `j` is 2. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
