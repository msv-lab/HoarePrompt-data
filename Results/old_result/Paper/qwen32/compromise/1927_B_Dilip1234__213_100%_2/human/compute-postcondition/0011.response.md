The code snippet `char_count[j] += 1` increments the value at index `j` of the list `char_count` by 1. Given that `j` is initially 1, the value at index 1 of `char_count` will be incremented from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n); `s` is a string containing 'b'; `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros except `char_count[1]` which is 1; `j` is 1**.
