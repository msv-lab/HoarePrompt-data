The code snippet `char_count[j] += 1` increments the value of `char_count[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 1, `char_count[1]` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string containing characters 'a' to 'z' in the order they were matched with `a[i]` and now includes 'b' at the end; `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, `char_count[0]` is incremented by 1, `char_count[1]` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must still be greater than `i`, and `j` is 1, with the most internal loop or if statement being exited.**
