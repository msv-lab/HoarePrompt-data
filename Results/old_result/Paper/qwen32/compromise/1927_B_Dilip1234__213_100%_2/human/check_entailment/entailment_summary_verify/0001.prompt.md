You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    s = ''
    char_count = [0] * 26
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(26):
            if char_count[j] == a[i]:
                s += chr(j + ord('a'))
                char_count[j] += 1
                break
    return s



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the length of the lost string, and `a`, a list of `n` integers representing the trace of the string. Regardless of the input values, the function always returns the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
We need to generate a string `s` based on a provided trace `a`. The trace `a` is an array where `a[i]` indicates how many characters before index `i` in `s` are the same as `s[i]`.

### Program Explanation:
1. **Initialization:**
   - We start by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, we read the length of the trace `n` and the trace array `a`.

2. **String Construction:**
   - We initialize an empty string `s` and a list `char_count` of size 26 (for each letter in the alphabet) with all values set to 0.
   - For each position `i` in the trace:
     - We loop through the `char_count` list to find the first character (from 'a' to 'z') whose count matches `a[i]`.
     - Once found, we append this character to `s` and increment its count in `char_count`.

3. **Output:**
   - We print the constructed string `s` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly iterates through each position in the trace and finds a character that has been used exactly `a[i]` times before it.
- It uses a simple character count array to keep track of how many times each character has been used.
- The logic ensures that the constructed string `s` will have the correct trace `a`.

### Correctness Check:
- The program follows the problem requirements and correctly constructs a string that matches the given trace.
- There are no logical errors or edge cases that would cause the program to fail based on the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
