Output State: **`s` is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 · 10^5. The length of the list `s` (number of test cases) is between 1 and 10^4. The sum of the lengths of all strings in `s` does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique strings from the list `s`. `i` is 0, `j` is the length of `unique_chars` minus 1.**

In this output state, the variables `i` and `j` have been initialized to 0 and the length of `unique_chars` minus 1, respectively. All other variables and their properties remain unchanged.
