### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided program and the problem requirements to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Construct the auxiliary string `r`:** This string consists of all distinct letters of the input string `s`, sorted in alphabetical order.
2. **Encoding process:** Each character in the string `s` is replaced by its symmetric character from the string `r` (the first character of `r` is replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on).
3. **Decoding process:** Given the encoded string `b`, we need to restore the original string `s`.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program is supposed to perform the decoding process. Let's walk through the logic of the `func_1` function:

1. **Unique Characters Extraction and Sorting:**
   ```python
   unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
   ```
   This line correctly identifies all unique characters in the string `s` and sorts them alphabetically.

2. **Symmetric Replacement Logic:**
   ```python
   (i, j) = (0, len(unique_chars) - 1)
   for char in s:
       if char in unique_chars:
           s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
           j -= 1
       else:
           unique_chars.insert(i, char)
           i += 1
           j += 1
   return ''.join(unique_chars)
   ```
   This code attempts to perform symmetric replacements. However, there are several issues:
   - The code tries to modify the string `s` in place, which is inefficient and incorrect because strings in Python are immutable.
   - The logic for replacing characters is flawed. Instead of replacing characters with their symmetric counterparts, it incorrectly modifies the string and the list of unique characters, leading to incorrect results.
   - The `else` block, which handles characters not in `unique_chars`, is unnecessary and incorrect for this problem since all characters in the encoded string `b` should be in the sorted list of unique characters.
   - The function returns the list of unique characters joined into a string, which is not the decoded string.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly decode the string, we should:
1. Extract and sort the unique characters in the encoded string `b`.
2. Create a mapping from each character in the sorted unique characters to its symmetric counterpart.
3. Use this mapping to transform the encoded string `b` back into the original string `s`.

### Implementation of Correct Approach:
Let's implement the correct decoding logic:

```python
def decode_string(b):
    unique_chars = sorted(list(set(b)))
    mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in b)
    return decoded_str

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = decode_string(b)
        print(decoded_str)
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding process as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
