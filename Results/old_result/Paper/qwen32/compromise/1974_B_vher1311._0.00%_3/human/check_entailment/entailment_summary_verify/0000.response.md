### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and its function `func_1` to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string as per the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Encoding Process:**
  1. Construct a new string `r` from the unique characters of the original string `s`, sorted alphabetically.
  2. Replace each character in `s` with its symmetric character in `r`.

- **Decoding Process:**
  - Given an encoded string `b`, reverse the encoding process to retrieve the original string `s`.

#### Given Program Analysis:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        encoded_str = func_1(b)
        print(encoded_str)

def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
    (i, j) = (0, len(unique_chars) - 1)
    for char in s:
        if char in unique_chars:
            s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
            j -= 1
        else:
            unique_chars.insert(i, char)
            i += 1
            j += 1
    return ''.join(unique_chars)
```

#### Function Summary:
The function summary provided does not accurately describe the behavior of `func_1`. The function is supposed to decode the string `b` by reversing the encoding process, but the summary only mentions concatenating unique characters in the order they were first encountered.

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Replacement Logic:**
   - The line `s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])` replaces all occurrences of `char` in the string `s` with `unique_chars[j]`. This is incorrect because it doesn't map each character to its symmetric character correctly.
   - The loop iterates over the string `s` and attempts to replace characters, which modifies the string `s` during iteration, leading to incorrect results.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Unique Characters:**
   - The logic for inserting characters and adjusting indices is flawed. The `else` block is unnecessary and incorrect for this problem.
   - The `unique_chars` list is not used to map characters back to their original positions correctly.

3. **Example of Incorrect Output:**
   - For the encoded string `b = "serofedsoc"`, the unique characters are `['c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'o', 'r', 's']` when sorted.
   - The correct decoding should map 's' to 'c', 'e' to 'o', 'r' to 'd', 'o' to 'e', 'f' to 'r', 'e' to 'o', 'd' to 'r', 's' to 'c', 'o' to 'e', and 'c' to 's'.
   - The expected output is `codeforces`.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly decode the encoded string.

#### Corrected Function:
To correctly decode the string, we need to map each character in the encoded string to its symmetric character in the sorted list of unique characters.

```python
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-i-1] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
```

This corrected function creates a mapping from each unique character to its symmetric character and then uses this mapping to decode the encoded string.

### Final Evaluation:
The given program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
