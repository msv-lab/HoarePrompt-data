Reasoning:

The given program is intended to decode a string `b` that was encoded according to a specific algorithm. The decoding process involves reversing the encoding steps, which means mapping each character in `b` back to its original character in the original string `s`.

However, the provided `func_1` function does not correctly implement the decoding logic. Here's a breakdown of why the function is incorrect:

1. **Unique Character Extraction**: The function correctly extracts unique characters from the input string `s` and sorts them alphabetically. This part is correct.

2. **Replacement Logic**: The function attempts to replace characters in `s` with characters from the end of the sorted unique characters list. However, it does this in a way that replaces all occurrences of a character at once, which is not the intended behavior. The replacement should map each character in `b` to its corresponding character in the original string `s` based on the symmetric mapping described in the problem statement.

3. **Incorrect Use of `replace`**: The use of `s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])` is incorrect for this problem because it replaces all occurrences of `char` in the entire string `s` at once, rather than replacing each occurrence individually as it is encountered.

4. **Concatenation of Unique Characters**: The function returns the concatenation of the unique characters list, which is not the decoded string. The correct approach would be to create a mapping from each character in the sorted unique characters list to its symmetric counterpart and then use this mapping to decode the string `b`.

Given these issues, the provided function does not correctly decode the string `b` to produce the original string `s`.

Correctness: **False**
