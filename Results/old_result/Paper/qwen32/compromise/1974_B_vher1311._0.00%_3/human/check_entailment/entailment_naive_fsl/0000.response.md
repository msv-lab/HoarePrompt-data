Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly decode the encoded string according to the problem description. The main issue lies in the `func_1` function, which is supposed to reverse the encoding process. However, the logic for decoding is flawed.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Replacement Logic**:
   The code attempts to replace each character in the encoded string `s` with its symmetric character from the sorted list of unique characters. However, it does not correctly map each character in the encoded string to its original character.
   
   Specifically, the line `s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])` replaces all occurrences of `char` in the string `s` with `unique_chars[j]`. This is incorrect because it does not maintain the one-to-one mapping required for decoding.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Unique Characters**:
   The code uses a set to find unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them. However, it does not correctly map these characters back to their original positions. The logic for inserting characters and adjusting indices is flawed and does not achieve the desired decoding.

3. **Example of Incorrect Output**:
   Let's consider the example provided in the problem description:
   - Encoded string `b = "serofedsoc"`
   - The unique characters in `b` are `['c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'o', 'r', 's']` when sorted.
   - The correct decoding should map 's' to 'c', 'e' to 'o', 'r' to 'd', 'o' to 'e', 'f' to 'r', 'e' to 'o', 'd' to 'r', 's' to 'c', 'o' to 'e', and 'c' to 's'.
   - The expected output is `codeforces`.

   However, the provided code does not produce the expected output. Instead, it attempts to replace all occurrences of each character in the encoded string with its symmetric character, which results in an incorrect and inconsistent mapping.

To fix the code, the decoding process should correctly map each character in the encoded string to its corresponding original character using the symmetric character mapping from the sorted list of unique characters. Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-i-1] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
```

This corrected function creates a mapping from each unique character to its symmetric character and then uses this mapping to decode the encoded string.
