The code snippet `counter[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the count of the element `a[i]` in the `Counter` object `counter` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, so `a[i]` is the last element in the list `a`. The `counter` object will have its count for `a[i]` reduced by 1. No other variables are affected in this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5), `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object with decremented counts for the elements used in `ans` and `counter[a[i]]` is decremented by 1, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - len(ans)` if `i > 0` otherwise `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is a list containing all the values appended during the loop including `a[i]`, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `adv` is 0.**
