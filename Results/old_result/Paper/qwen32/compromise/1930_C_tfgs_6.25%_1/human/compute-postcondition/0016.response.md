Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5), `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least one element, `counter` is a Counter object, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is an empty list, and `i` is greater than 0; `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])`.**

In this output state, the only variable that has been changed is `adv`, which is assigned the value of `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])`. All other variables retain their initial values and properties.
