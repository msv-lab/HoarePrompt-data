The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the loop statement, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 again. The value of `n` does not change in the loop head.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5); `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + 2 * (i + 1)`; `i` is incremented by 1.

Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented again. Therefore, `i` needs to be set to its current value plus 1.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5); `a` is a list of `n` integers; `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise in the state description, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5); `a` is a list of `n` integers; `i` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can generalize it as:

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5); `a` is a list of `n` integers; `i` is incremented by 1**.

But to be more specific in terms of the next iteration:

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5); `a` is a list of `n` integers; `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**.

Given the task constraints, the most accurate and generalized form is:

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5); `a` is a list of `n` integers; `i` is incremented by 1**.

However, to match the format of the previous examples:

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5); `a` is a list of `n` integers; `i` is `i + 1`**.
