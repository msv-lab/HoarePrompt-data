Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, modifies each element of `a` by adding its 1-based index, then constructs a new list `ans` that includes all unique elements of the modified `a` in descending order, along with additional integers inserted between these elements to ensure the total length of `ans` is `n`. The final list `ans` is printed.**
