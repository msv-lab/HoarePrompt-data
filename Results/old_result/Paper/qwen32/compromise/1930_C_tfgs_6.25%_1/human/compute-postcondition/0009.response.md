The code updates the list `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element `a[i]`, where `i` is the index of the element. After updating the list, a `Counter` object named `counter` is created from the updated list `a`. The `Counter` object will hold the frequency of each element in the updated list.

Given the initial state, the list `a` is modified as follows:
- Each element `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + i + 1`.

The `Counter` object `counter` will then reflect the frequency of each unique value in the updated list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5); `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + i + 1`; `counter` is a Counter object that holds the frequency of each element in the updated list `a`.**
