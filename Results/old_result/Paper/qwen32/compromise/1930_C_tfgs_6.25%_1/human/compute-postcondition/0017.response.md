To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `j` and `adv`.

Here is the loop statement:
```
for j in range(adv):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `adv` is greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `adv` is greater than 0. Let's break down the expression for `adv`:
```
adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
```

For `adv` to be greater than 0, all three terms inside the `min` function must be greater than 0. Let's analyze each term:

1. `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`: Since `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `a[i - 1] > a[i]`. Therefore, `a[i - 1] - a[i]` is positive. For `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1` to be greater than 0, `a[i - 1] - a[i]` must be greater than 1, which means `a[i - 1]` must be at least 2 more than `a[i]`.

2. `cnt`: Given `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, and `a` has at least one element (`len(a) >= 1`), `cnt` can be 0 or positive. For `adv` to be greater than 0, `cnt` must be greater than 0, so `n` must be greater than `len(a)`.

3. `counter[a[i - 1]]`: This term represents the count of the element `a[i - 1]` in the `counter` object. For `adv` to be greater than 0, `counter[a[i - 1]]` must be greater than 0, which means `a[i - 1]` must be present in the `counter` object with a count greater than 0.

Given these conditions, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `adv` is greater than 0. Here is the adjusted state:

- `i` must be such that `a[i - 1]` and `a[i]` exist and `a[i - 1]` is at least 2 more than `a[i]`.
- `n` must be greater than `len(a)` to ensure `cnt` is greater than 0.
- `counter[a[i - 1]]` must be greater than 0.

Since the problem specifies that `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least one element, and `i` is greater than 0, we can assume that `a[i - 1]` and `a[i]` exist and `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`. To ensure `a[i - 1]` is at least 2 more than `a[i]`, we can simply assume that the difference is at least 2.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5), `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least two elements such that `a[i - 1]` is at least 2 more than `a[i]`, `counter` is a Counter object with `counter[a[i - 1]]` greater than 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is an empty list, and `i` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `len(a)`**.
