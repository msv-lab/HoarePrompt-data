The provided code snippet appends a new element to the list `ans`, which is calculated as `ans[-1] - 1`. This means the last element of `ans` is decremented by 1 and added to the end of the list.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `ans`, as it gains a new element. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `counter`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5); `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order; `counter` is a Counter object with decremented counts for the elements used in `ans`; `cnt` is `n - len(ans) - 3` and must be greater than 0; `ans` is a list containing all elements of `a` and all additional integers inserted between consecutive elements in `a` up to the constraints of `cnt` and the counts in the `counter`, with an additional element `ans[-2] - 1` appended to it, and then another element `ans[-1] - 1` appended to it. The new element appended to `ans` is `ans[-2] - 1`.**
