You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of array a, and a list a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5); `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + i + 1`.
    counter = Counter(a)
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
    #State: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5); `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order; `counter` is a Counter object with decremented counts for the elements used in `ans`; `cnt` is `n - len(ans)`; `ans` is a list containing all elements of `a` and all additional integers inserted between consecutive elements in `a` up to the constraints of `cnt` and the counts in the `counter`.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5); `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order; `counter` is a Counter object with decremented counts for the elements used in `ans`; `cnt` is `0`; `ans` is a list containing all elements of `a` and all additional integers inserted between consecutive elements in `a` up to the constraints of `cnt` and the counts in the `counter`, with additional elements appended such that the length of `ans` is `n`.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: Elements of `ans` (where `ans` is a list containing all elements of `a` and additional integers inserted or appended to meet the length requirement of `n`)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` representing the length of array `a`, and a list `a` of `n` integers representing the elements of the array. The function returns some value based on the elements of the array `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
