The code provided reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. Given the initial state, `n` is already assigned the value of the input integer representing the length of the array. The variable `a` is then assigned the list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of array `a`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of array `a`.**
