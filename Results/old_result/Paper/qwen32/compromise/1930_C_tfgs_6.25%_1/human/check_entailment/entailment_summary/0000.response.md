### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the steps and logic to ensure correctness.

1. **Reading Input and Modifying Array**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers.
   - It then modifies each element of `a` by adding its 1-based index (`a[i] += i + 1`). This step aligns with the problem statement where `a_i + i` is to be inserted into the set `S`.

2. **Constructing the Set and Removing Duplicates**:
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count occurrences of each modified element.
   - It converts the modified list `a` into a set to remove duplicates, ensuring that `S` contains only unique elements.

3. **Sorting and Building the Result**:
   - The program sorts the unique elements in descending order.
   - It then constructs the final array `b` (referred to as `ans` in the code) by iterating through the sorted unique elements and inserting additional elements between them to ensure the total length of `ans` is `n`.
   - The logic for inserting additional elements is based on the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list and the remaining count of elements needed to reach `n`.

4. **Handling Remaining Elements**:
   - If there are still elements to be added to reach the required length `n`, the program appends the last element of `ans` decremented by 1, ensuring the array `b` is lexicographically as large as possible.

### Verification Against the Example:

Let's verify the program's logic against the provided example:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `n = 2`, `a = [2, 1]`
   - Modified `a`: `[3, 2]`
   - Unique elements in descending order: `[3, 2]`
   - Result: `[3, 2]`

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `a = [1, 100, 1000, 1000000, 1000000000]`
   - Modified `a`: `[2, 102, 1003, 1000004, 1000000005]`
   - Unique elements in descending order: `[1000000005, 1000004, 1003, 102, 2]`
   - Result: `[1000000005, 1000004, 1003, 102, 2]`

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `n = 3`, `a = [6, 4, 8]`
   - Modified `a`: `[7, 6, 11]`
   - Unique elements in descending order: `[11, 7, 6]`
   - Result: `[11, 7, 6]`

The program correctly handles the examples provided in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically largest `b` by following the steps outlined in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
