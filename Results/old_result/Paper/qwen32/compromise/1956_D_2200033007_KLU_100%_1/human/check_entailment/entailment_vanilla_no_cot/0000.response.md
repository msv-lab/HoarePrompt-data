Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Global Variables and Scope Issues**: The functions `func_2` and `make_stairs` use the variable `start_index` which is not defined within their scope. This will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Logic Errors in `make_stairs`**: The function `make_stairs` is supposed to create a sequence of operations to make the subarray a staircase (i.e., `[0, 1, 2, ..., i]`). However, it modifies the array `arr` directly and uses a global `res` list to store the operations. The logic for creating the staircase is flawed and does not correctly handle the array modifications.

3. **Incorrect Calculation in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the maximum possible sum for a subarray. However, the logic for calculating the maximum sum is incorrect. The function does not correctly consider the MEX operation and instead seems to be trying to maximize the sum by splitting the array and considering the sum of subarrays, which is not the correct approach for this problem.

4. **Output Format**: The program does not correctly format the output as required. It does not correctly calculate the number of operations or the sequence of operations.

5. **No Handling of MEX Operation**: The program does not correctly handle the MEX operation, which is crucial for solving the problem. The MEX operation should be used to determine the value to set the subarray to, and this value should be chosen to maximize the sum of the array.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and will not produce the correct output for the problem as described.
