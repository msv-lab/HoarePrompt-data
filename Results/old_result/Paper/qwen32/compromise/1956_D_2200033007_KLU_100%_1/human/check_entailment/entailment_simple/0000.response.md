### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by recursively calculating the maximum possible sum of the array and the corresponding operations needed to achieve this sum. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Function `func_1(start_index, end_index)`**:
   - This function calculates the maximum possible sum of the subarray `arr[start_index:end_index+1]` by considering all possible ways to partition the subarray and applying the MEX operation.
   - The function uses memoization (via `res_dict`) to store already computed results for subarrays to avoid redundant calculations.
   - It considers three main cases:
     - If the subarray has only one element, it returns `max(1, arr[start_index])` because the MEX of a single element is at least 1.
     - If the subarray can be transformed into a sequence of consecutive integers (i.e., a "staircase"), it returns the sum of the first `length` natural numbers.
     - Otherwise, it recursively calculates the maximum sum by considering all possible partitions of the subarray and choosing the one that yields the highest sum.

2. **Function `func_2(start_index, end_index)`**:
   - This function constructs the sequence of operations needed to transform the subarray `arr[start_index:end_index+1]` into the configuration that yields the maximum sum.
   - Similar to `func_1`, it uses the results from `func_1` to determine the optimal operations.
   - The function handles the same three main cases as `func_1`:
     - If the subarray has only one element, it checks if the element is already greater than 0. If not, it returns an operation to set it to 1.
     - If the subarray can be transformed into a "staircase", it returns the operations needed to construct this staircase.
     - Otherwise, it recursively constructs the operations for the optimal partition of the subarray.

3. **Function `make_stairs(i)`**:
   - This function constructs a "staircase" in the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index+i+1]` by setting each element to its respective index.
   - It uses recursion to ensure that the subarray is transformed into a sequence of consecutive integers starting from 0.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array and the corresponding operations. It uses dynamic programming with memoization to efficiently compute the maximum sum and ensures that the operations are constructed correctly.

However, there are a few issues in the code:
- The variable `res` in `func_2` is not defined within its scope. It should be a parameter passed from the main function or a global variable.
- The function `make_stairs` uses a global variable `res` and `start_index`, which is not defined within its scope. It should be passed as parameters.
- The function `make_stairs` modifies the global array `arr` directly, which is acceptable in this context but should be handled with care.

Given these points, the program's logic is correct, but the code needs to be fixed for proper variable scoping and usage. Assuming these issues are resolved, the program would correctly solve the problem.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True** (assuming the mentioned issues are fixed)

However, based on the provided code without fixes:

Correctness: **False**
