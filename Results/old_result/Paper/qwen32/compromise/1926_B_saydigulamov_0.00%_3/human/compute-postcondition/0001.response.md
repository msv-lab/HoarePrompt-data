The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `a`. Since `a` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and is given to be in the range 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, the loop will definitely execute at least once if `a` is within this range. 

Before the loop starts, the state `a` is an integer between 1 and 100, which ensures that the loop will execute. The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range` function in the loop head.

State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, `i` is not yet initialized**
