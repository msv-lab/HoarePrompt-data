Postcondition: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, `i` is 3, `b` is the new user's input, and `k` is a list. If '1' is in `b`, `k` includes the count of '1' in the current `b` along with any previous counts. The input value for the next iteration must be greater than 2. Otherwise, if '1' is not in `b`, `k` remains unchanged. The input value for the next iteration must still be greater than 2.**
