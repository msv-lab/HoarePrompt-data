To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`a`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\).
2. **`i`**: Defined as `n + 2`, where `n` is the number of iterations.
3. **`k`**: A list containing the counts of '1's from all strings `b` that contained '1' during the `n` iterations. The current value of `k[0]` is equal to the current value of `k[1]`.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(k)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `a` is an integer between 1 and 100, but it is not directly used in the print statement.
- The variable `i` is defined as `n + 2`, but it is also not directly used in the print statement.
- The variable `k` is a list that contains counts of '1's from strings `b` during `n` iterations. The specific values of `k` are not provided, except that `k[0]` is equal to `k[1]`.

Given the precondition, the output of the print statement will be the list `k`.

### Output:
Since we do not have the exact values of the elements in `k` except for the fact that `k[0]` equals `k[1]`, the most precise description of the output is the list `k` with the known condition that `k[0]` is equal to `k[1]`.

Output: **k (where k is a list and k[0] is equal to k[1])**
