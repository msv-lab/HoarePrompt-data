To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given information. The loop iterates a number of times specified by the input `a` (1 ≤ a ≤ 100). During each iteration, the loop reads a string `b` and checks if it contains the character '1'. If it does, the count of '1's in `b` is appended to the list `k`. If it doesn't, nothing is appended to `k`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the general behavior for any number of iterations. After each iteration, if the string `b` contains '1's, the count of '1's is appended to `k`. If it doesn't, `k` remains unchanged.

Therefore, after all `a` iterations, `k` will contain the counts of '1's from each of the `a` input strings `b` that contained '1's. If none of the strings contained '1's, `k` will remain an empty list.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, `i` is 1, and `k` is a list containing the counts of '1's from each of the `a` input strings `b` that contained '1's. If none of the strings contained '1's, `k` is an empty list.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `k` will have the counts of '1's from each input string that had '1's, and `a` and `i` will remain unchanged from their initial values.
