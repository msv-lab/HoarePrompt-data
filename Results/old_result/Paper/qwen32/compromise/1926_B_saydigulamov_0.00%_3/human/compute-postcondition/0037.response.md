Let's analyze the given initial state and understand the conditions:

- `a` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `i` is set to 1.
- `k` is a list containing the counts of '1's from each of the `a` input strings `b` that contained '1's.
- If none of the strings contained '1's, `k` is an empty list.
- The first and second elements of `k` are equal.

Given these conditions, let's consider the implications:

1. **If `a` is 1:**
   - There is only one string `b`.
   - If this string does not contain '1', `k` will be an empty list.
   - If this string contains '1', `k` will have one element, which is the count of '1's in that string. However, the condition that the first and second elements of `k` are equal cannot be met since there is only one element.

2. **If `a` is greater than 1:**
   - There are multiple strings `b`.
   - `k` will contain the counts of '1's from each string that contains '1's.
   - The condition that the first and second elements of `k` are equal means that the first two strings (or the first string repeated) must have the same count of '1's.

Given these points, the list `k` can either be:
- An empty list if none of the strings contain '1's.
- A list with at least two elements where the first two elements are equal.

Since the problem specifies that the first and second elements of `k` are equal, and `k` cannot be empty based on this condition, `k` must have at least two elements, both of which are equal.

Thus, the output will be a list with at least two equal elements. However, without knowing the exact counts of '1's in the strings, we can only describe the structure of `k` based on the given conditions.

Output: **[x, x, ...] (where x is the count of '1's in the first string that contains '1's and all subsequent elements are equal to x if they exist)**
