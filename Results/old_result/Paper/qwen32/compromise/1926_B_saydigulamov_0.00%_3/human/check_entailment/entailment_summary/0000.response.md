Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a triangle or a square. The current implementation only checks if the number of '1's in the first two rows that contain '1's are equal and then prints the list of these counts. This is not sufficient to identify whether the shape is a triangle or a square. 

To correctly determine the shape, the program needs to:
1. Identify the dimensions and positions of all '1's in the grid.
2. Check if these '1's form a square or a triangle based on the definitions provided in the problem description.

The current program does not perform these checks and thus does not solve the problem as intended.

Correctness: **False**
