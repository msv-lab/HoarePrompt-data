Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle based on the given problem description. The current implementation only checks if the counts of '1's in the first two rows that contain '1's are equal and prints the list of counts if they are equal. This is not sufficient to determine the shape of the figure. 

To correctly determine if the shape is a square or a triangle, the program needs to:
1. Identify the rows that contain '1's.
2. Check if the counts of '1's in these rows form a pattern that matches either a square or a triangle.

For a square, every row with '1's should have the same number of '1's, and these '1's should be positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

For a triangle, the counts of '1's in the rows should follow the pattern of an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2, and the central '1's should be located in one column for an upright triangle or in a mirrored pattern for an upside-down triangle.

Given the current implementation, the program will not output "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required by the problem statement. Instead, it will only print the list of counts of '1's if the first two counts are equal, which is not a valid solution to the problem.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
