You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4b06bb9ff8f408edc96077ace0d5e299065a3c50.png)
Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine whether the given binary grid contains a triangle or a square, based on the specific patterns described for each shape.

### Program Analysis
Here's the provided program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)
```

Let's break down the code:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases (`a`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid (`n`).
   - It then reads `n` lines of the grid.

2. **Processing Each Line**:
   - For each line, it checks if there is at least one '1'.
   - If there is, it counts the number of '1's in that line and appends this count to the list `k`.

3. **Determining the Shape**:
   - The program then checks if the first and second counts in `k` are equal.
   - If they are, it prints the list `k`.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Shape Detection**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to detect whether the shape is a triangle or a square.
   - The check `if k[0] == k[1]:` is insufficient to determine the shape. It only checks if the first two rows have the same number of '1's, which is not enough to conclude the shape.

2. **Output**:
   - The program prints the list `k` if the condition is met, which is not the required output. The output should be either "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE".

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the shape is an upside-down triangle or a square that does not start from the first row.

### Correctness
Given the above analysis, the provided program is incorrect. It does not correctly identify the shape based on the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
