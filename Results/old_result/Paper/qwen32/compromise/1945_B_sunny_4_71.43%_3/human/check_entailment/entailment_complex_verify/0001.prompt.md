You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the
camp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose,
the organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks
and a huge number of shells for launching.

Both installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation
launches fireworks every a minutes (i.e., after a, 2 \cdot a, 3 \cdot a, \dots
minutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b
minutes (i.e., after b, 2 \cdot b, 3 \cdot b, \dots minutes after launch).

Each firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a
firework was launched after x minutes after the installations were turned on,
it will be visible every minute from x to x + m , inclusive. If one firework
was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one
minute.

What is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the
same time?

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow the
descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains integers a , b , m (1 \le
a, b, m \le 10^{18} ) — the frequency of launching for the first installation,
the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.

Output

For each set of input data, output a single number — the maximum number of
fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

Note

In the first set of input data, the fireworks are visible in the sky for 5
minutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and
the second one every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from the same
installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same
time, after 7 minutes from the start of the holiday, one firework from the
first and one from the second camp will be visible. Thus, it is possible to
see no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously.

In the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112
minutes:

  * 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 ]; 
  * 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 ].

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        A = int(m / a) + 1
        B = int(m / b) + 1
        print(A + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains three integers a, b, and m (1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18) representing the frequency of launching fireworks for the first and second installations, and the visibility duration of each firework, respectively. There are t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) test cases.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        A = int(m / a) + 1
        
        B = int(m / b) + 1
        
        print(A + B)
        
    #State: A series of integers, each representing the sum of `A` and `B` for each test case, where `A = int(m / a) + 1` and `B = int(m / b) + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the sum of two values `A` and `B`, where `A` is the number of times fireworks from the first installation are visible within the duration `m` plus one, and `B` is the number of times fireworks from the second installation are visible within the duration `m` plus one.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. However, the logic implemented in the program is incorrect. Here's a step-by-step analysis of why:

1. The program calculates `A` as the number of fireworks launched by the first installation that could be visible at the same time, which is `int(m / a) + 1`. This calculation considers the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period `m` minutes. However, it does not account for the possibility of fireworks from the second installation being visible at the same time.

2. Similarly, `B` is calculated as the number of fireworks launched by the second installation that could be visible at the same time, which is `int(m / b) + 1`. This calculation is also incorrect for the same reason as above.

3. The program then simply adds `A` and `B` and prints the result. This approach does not account for the overlap in visibility times between fireworks from the two installations. For example, if a firework from the first installation is launched at time `x`, and a firework from the second installation is launched at time `y`, and `|x - y| <= m`, then both fireworks will be visible at the same time. The program does not consider these overlaps.

4. The correct approach would involve finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity at which both installations launch fireworks simultaneously and then calculating the number of fireworks visible at each period, taking into account the visibility duration `m`.
