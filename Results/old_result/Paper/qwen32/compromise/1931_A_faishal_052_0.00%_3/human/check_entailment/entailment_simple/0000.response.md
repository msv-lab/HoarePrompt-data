Reasoning:

The given program is supposed to determine the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that could have been encoded to a given sum of positions in the alphabet. However, the provided code does not correctly implement this logic. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Looping and Condition Handling:**
   - The loop `for j in range(2)` only runs twice, which is incorrect because we need to determine three letters.
   - The conditions inside the loop are not properly adjusted to handle the remaining value (`lex`) after appending to `arr`. Specifically, the condition `elif lex < 52` is not appropriate because it should be `elif lex > 26` to handle the remaining value correctly.
   - The logic for appending values to `arr` is flawed. The code should ensure that the values are correctly adjusted and appended to `arr` to reflect the positions of the letters in the alphabet.

2. **Appending the Remaining Value:**
   - After the loop, the remaining value of `lex` is appended to `arr`. This value should be adjusted to ensure it represents a valid letter position (i.e., between 1 and 26).

3. **Sorting the Array:**
   - Sorting the array `arr` is unnecessary and incorrect. The goal is to find the lexicographically smallest word, which means the smallest letters should come first. The current logic does not guarantee this.

4. **Generating the Output:**
   - The output is generated by converting the values in `arr` to characters using `chr(arr[k] + 96)`. This is correct, but due to the incorrect logic in determining the values in `arr`, the output will not be the lexicographically smallest word.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for each test case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
