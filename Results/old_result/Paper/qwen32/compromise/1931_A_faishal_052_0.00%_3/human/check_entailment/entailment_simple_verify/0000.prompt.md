You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have been encoded. Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Value**: The program incorrectly handles the remaining value after assigning the first two letters. Specifically, it does not ensure that the remaining value can be represented by a single letter (i.e., a value between 1 and 26).

2. **Sorting the Letters**: The program sorts the letters after assigning them, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. The goal is to find the lexicographically smallest word, so the letters should be assigned in ascending order without sorting.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, when the input value is 3, the output should be "aaa", but the program might not handle this correctly.

Let's consider a specific example where the program fails:

- **Input**: `3`
- **Expected Output**: `aaa`
- **Actual Output**: The program might output something like `aaz` or another incorrect combination because it doesn't correctly handle the remaining value after assigning the first two letters.

Here's a corrected version of the program to illustrate the correct approach:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        n = int(input())
        # Start with the smallest possible letters
        a = b = c = 1
        # Assign the remaining value to the third letter
        remaining = n - 3
        if remaining > 0:
            c += remaining
            if c > 26:
                b += c - 26
                c = 26
                if b > 26:
                    a += b - 26
                    b = 26
        print(chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96))

# Example usage
# func()
```

In the corrected version:
- We start by assigning the smallest possible values (1) to `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- We then assign the remaining value to `c` and adjust `b` and `a` if necessary to ensure all values are between 1 and 26.
- We print the letters in the correct order without sorting.

This ensures that the output is the lexicographically smallest word for any valid input.
