Let's break down the problem step by step based on the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value:
  - If `lex` was initially \(\leq 26\), it is now `lex - 2`.
  - If `lex` was initially between 26 and 51, it is now `lex - 27`.
  - If `lex` was initially between 52 and 77, it is now `lex - 52`.
- `cases` is \(\geq 1\).
- `arr` is a list that can be one of `[1, 1, 1]`, `[1, 1, 26]`, or `[1, 26, 26]`.
- `j` is 1.

### Print Statement:
```
print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement uses the `chr()` function, which converts an ASCII value to its corresponding character.
- The ASCII value being converted is `arr[k] + 96`.
- `arr` is one of `[1, 1, 1]`, `[1, 1, 26]`, or `[1, 26, 26]`.
- The value of `k` is not specified in the initial state, but we can analyze the possible values of `arr[k]` for each possible list.

### Possible Values of `arr[k]`:
- If `arr` is `[1, 1, 1]`, then `arr[k]` can be 1.
- If `arr` is `[1, 1, 26]`, then `arr[k]` can be 1 or 26.
- If `arr` is `[1, 26, 26]`, then `arr[k]` can be 1 or 26.

### ASCII Conversion:
- For `arr[k] = 1`, `chr(1 + 96)` is `chr(97)`, which is the character `'a'`.
- For `arr[k] = 26`, `chr(26 + 96)` is `chr(122)`, which is the character `'z'`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output either `'a'` or `'z'` depending on the value of `arr[k]`. Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we cannot determine with certainty whether `'a'` or `'z'` will be printed. However, we can describe the possible outputs.

Output: **'a' or 'z' (depending on the value of arr[k])**
