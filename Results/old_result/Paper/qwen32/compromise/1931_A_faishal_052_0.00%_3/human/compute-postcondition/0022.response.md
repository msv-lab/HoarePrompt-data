The code appends the integer 26 to the list `arr`. The initial state specifies that `arr` either contains the integer 1 (if `lex` is less than or equal to 26) or the integer 26 (if `lex` is greater than 26). After appending 26, `arr` will contain either `[1, 26]` or `[26, 26]` depending on the initial value of `lex`. The values of `t`, `lex`, `cases`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list containing either `[1, 26]` or `[26, 26]`, `j` is 1**
