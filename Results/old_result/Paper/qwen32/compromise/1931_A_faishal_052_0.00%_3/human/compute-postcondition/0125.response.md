The code snippet sorts the list `arr`. Given that `arr` initially has three elements, where the first two are either 1 or 26, and the third is `lex`, the sorting operation will arrange these elements in ascending order.

Since the first two elements are either 1 or 26, and `lex` can be any integer, the sorted order will depend on the specific values of these elements. However, we can make some general observations:
- If `lex` is less than 1, the sorted order will be `[lex, 1, 26]` or `[lex, 1, 1]` or `[lex, 26, 26]` depending on the values of the first two elements.
- If `lex` is between 1 and 26, the sorted order will be `[1, lex, 26]` or `[1, 1, 26]` or `[1, 26, 26]` depending on the values of the first two elements.
- If `lex` is greater than 26, the sorted order will be `[1, 26, lex]` or `[1, 1, lex]` or `[26, 26, lex]` depending on the values of the first two elements.

Given the initial conditions, the specific values of `arr` after sorting will be determined by the initial values of the elements in `arr`. However, the other variables (`t`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is adjusted based on its original value (decremented by 1 or 26 for each iteration), `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is a sorted list with 3 elements (the first two being either 1 or 26, and the third being `lex`), `i` is 3, `j` is 2, and `k` is 2.**
