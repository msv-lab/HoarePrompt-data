Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is adjusted based on its original value: if `lex` was originally <= 26, `lex` is decreased by 2; if `lex` was originally in the range 27 to 51, `lex` is decreased by 1; if `lex` was originally > 51, `lex` remains unchanged except for the adjustments described in the else part. `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list with at least 5 elements and its last element is 26. If `lex` (after adjustment) is in the range 0 to 24, the second-to-last element of `arr` is 26 and `arr` has at least 6 elements; otherwise, if `lex` (after adjustment) is greater than 25 and less than 51, the second-to-last element of `arr` is 26 and `arr` has at least 6 elements. `i` is 3, `j` is 2, and `k` is 2.**
