Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value but is less than 26, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is [], `i` is 3, `j` is 0, and `k` is 2. The loop will have printed the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `arr[0] + 96`, `arr[1] + 96`, and `arr[2] + 96` in sequence.**

Explanation: The variable `arr` is reassigned to an empty list `[]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
