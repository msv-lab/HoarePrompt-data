Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer minus 1 if `lex` <= 26, otherwise `lex` is an integer greater than 26, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list with at least 5 elements where the last element is 26, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, and `k` is 2.**

Explanation: The list `arr` has had an additional element, 26, appended to it, making its length at least 5 elements. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
