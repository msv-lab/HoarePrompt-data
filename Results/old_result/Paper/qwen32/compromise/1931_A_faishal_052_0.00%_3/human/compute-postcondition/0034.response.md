Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `lex` is an integer, if `lex` was initially less than or equal to 25 then `lex` is now `lex - 1` (and thus less than or equal to 24), if `lex` was initially between 26 and 51 then `lex` is now `lex - 27` (and thus less than or equal to 24), if `lex` was initially between 52 and 77 then `lex` is now `lex - 26` (and thus less than or equal to -1), if `lex` was initially between 78 and 103 then `lex` is now `lex - 52` (and thus between 26 and 51), `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list that is either `[1, 1, 1]`, `[26, 1, 1]`, `[1, 26, 1]`, `[26, 26, 1]`, `[1, 1, 26]`, `[26, 1, 26]`, `[1, 26, 26]`, or `[26, 26, 26]`, and `j` is 2.**
