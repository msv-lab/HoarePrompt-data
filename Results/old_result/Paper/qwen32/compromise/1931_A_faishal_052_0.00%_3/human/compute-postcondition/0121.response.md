Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an integer that is either negative if it was originally in the range 0 to 25, in the range 0 to 24 if it was originally in the range 26 to 50, or greater than 24 if it was originally greater than 50. If `lex` is in the range 0 to 24 after adjustment, `arr` is a list with at least 6 elements where the last element is 26 and the second-to-last element is 26; otherwise, `arr` is a list with at least 5 elements where the last element is 26 and the second-to-last element is 26 if `lex` (after decrementing by 1) is greater than 25 and less than 51. `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, and `k` is 2. If `lex` was originally greater than 51, it is adjusted by subtracting 27 if it was originally <= 26, or by subtracting 27 if it was originally in the range 27 to 51, or remains greater than -25 if it was originally > 51.**
