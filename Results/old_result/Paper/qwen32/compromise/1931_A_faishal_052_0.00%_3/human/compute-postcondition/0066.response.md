The code snippet appends the value `26` to the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `arr` can either be `[1]` or `[26]`. After appending `26`, if `arr` was initially `[1]`, it becomes `[1, 26]`. If `arr` was initially `[26]`, it becomes `[26, 26]`.

The other variables (`t`, `lex`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an integer value provided by the user input, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is either [1, 26] or [26, 26], `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3**.
