To determine the output of the provided `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and how the variables are defined:

1. **Variable `t`**: It is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). However, the value of `t` is not directly used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for this particular output.

2. **Variable `lex`**: Its value is adjusted based on its initial value. However, the value of `lex` is not used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it as well.

3. **Variable `cases`**: It is greater than or equal to 1, but it is not used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it.

4. **List `arr`**: It can be one of three possible lists: `[1, 1, 1]`, `[1, 1, 26]`, or `[1, 26, 26]`.

5. **Variables `j` and `k`**: `j` is 1 and `k` is 3. However, `j` is not used in the `print` statement, and `k` is used to index into the list `arr`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
```

Given that `k` is 3, we need to consider the value of `arr[3]`. However, Python uses 0-based indexing, so `arr[3]` would be out of bounds for any of the provided lists. Therefore, the correct interpretation should be that `k` is actually 2 (since the problem likely intended to use the third element of the list, which would be at index 2).

Let's consider the three possible values for `arr[2]`:

- If `arr` is `[1, 1, 1]`, then `arr[2]` is 1.
- If `arr` is `[1, 1, 26]`, then `arr[2]` is 26.
- If `arr` is `[1, 26, 26]`, then `arr[2]` is 26.

The `chr` function converts an integer to its corresponding ASCII character. Adding 96 to these values gives:

- If `arr[2]` is 1, then `chr(1 + 96)` is `chr(97)`, which is 'a'.
- If `arr[2]` is 26, then `chr(26 + 96)` is `chr(122)`, which is 'z'.

Therefore, the output will be either 'a' or 'z', depending on the value of `arr[2]`.

Output: **a or z (depending on the value of arr[2])**
