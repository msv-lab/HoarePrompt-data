Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an integer value provided by the user input, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is either [1] or [26], `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 3. If `lex` was originally less than or equal to 26, `lex` is now `lex` minus 1 and `arr` is [1]. If `lex` was originally greater than 26, `arr` is [26] and if `lex` was less than 52, `lex` is now `lex` minus 26 and is greater than 0 but less than 26. Otherwise, `lex` is `lex` minus 26 and is greater than 26.**
