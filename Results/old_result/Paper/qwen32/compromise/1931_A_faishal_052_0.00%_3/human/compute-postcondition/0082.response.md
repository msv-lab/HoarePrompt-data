The only variable in the loop head of the given `for` loop is `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is within the range specified in the `range(3)` function, which means `k` should be 0, 1, or 2. 

Given the initial state where `k` is 3, the loop will not execute because `k` is out of the range. Therefore, we need to adjust `k` to be within the range [0, 2].

The other variables (`t`, `lex`, `cases`, `arr`, `i`, and `j`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value but is less than 26, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is either `[1, 1, lex]`, `[1, lex, 26]`, or `[lex, 26, 26]`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `k` is 0**
