The code appends the value of `lex` to the list `arr`. Therefore, the list `arr`, which originally had 2 elements, will now have 3 elements, with the third element being the value of `lex`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is adjusted based on its original value (decremented by 1 or 26 for each iteration), `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list with 3 elements (the first two being either 1 or 26, and the third being `lex`), `i` is 3, `j` is 2, and `k` is 2.**
