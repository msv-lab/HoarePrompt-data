The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `arr`. This action does not affect the values of `t` or `n`, nor does it change the precondition that `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer between 3 and 78. The only change is the creation of the list `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78; `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list.**
