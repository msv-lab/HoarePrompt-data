To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to carefully analyze the loop's behavior and the given initial state and the states after the first 3 iterations. 

The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(2):
    if lex <= 26:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    else:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
```
The loop runs for `j` in the range of 2, meaning it will execute exactly 2 times.

### Analysis of the Loop Execution:
1. **First Iteration (`j = 0`)**:
   - If `lex <= 26`, append `1` to `arr` and decrease `lex` by `1`.
   - If `26 < lex < 52`, append `26` to `arr` and decrease `lex` by `26`.
   - If `lex >= 52`, append `26` to `arr` and decrease `lex` by `26`.

2. **Second Iteration (`j = 1`)**:
   - The same logic applies as in the first iteration, but the value of `lex` is now adjusted from the previous iteration.

### Final Output State:
- The loop will run exactly 2 times, so `arr` will have exactly 2 elements.
- The value of `lex` will be adjusted after each iteration based on the conditions specified.
- The variables `t`, `cases`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

### Possible Values of `arr`:
- If `lex` was initially less than or equal to 26, `arr` could be `[1, 1]` if `lex` was 2 or less after the first iteration, or `[1, 26]` if `lex` was between 3 and 26 after the first iteration.
- If `lex` was initially between 27 and 51, `arr` could be `[26, 1]` if `lex` was 27 or less after the first iteration, or `[26, 26]` if `lex` was between 28 and 51 after the first iteration.
- If `lex` was initially 52 or more, `arr` could be `[26, 1]` if `lex` was 27 or less after the first iteration, or `[26, 26]` if `lex` was between 28 and 51 after the first iteration.

### Final Calculation:
Let's summarize the possible final states of `arr` and `lex`:
- If `lex` was initially less than or equal to 26, `arr` could be `[1, 1]` or `[1, 26]` and `lex` would be `lex - 2` or `lex - 27` respectively.
- If `lex` was initially between 27 and 51, `arr` could be `[26, 1]` or `[26, 26]` and `lex` would be `lex - 27` or `lex - 52` respectively.
- If `lex` was initially 52 or more, `arr` could be `[26, 1]` or `[26, 26]` and `lex` would be `lex - 52` or `lex - 52` respectively.

Given the range of `lex`, the final value of `lex` will be adjusted based on the initial value, but it will always be less than 26 after the second iteration.

### Conclusion:
The final output state will be:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `lex` will be adjusted based on its initial value, but it will be less than 26.
- `cases` remains greater than 2.
- `arr` will have 2 elements, either `[1, 1]`, `[1, 26]`, `[26, 1]`, or `[26, 26]` depending on the initial value of `lex`.
- `i` remains 2.
- `j` will be 0 as the loop has finished.
- `k` remains 3.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value but is less than 26, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is either [1, 1], [1, 26], [26, 1], or [26, 26], `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `k` is 3.**
