The code snippet appends the value `26` to the list `arr`. The initial state of `arr` depends on the value of `lex`, but after executing the code, `arr` will have an additional element `26` appended to it. The values of `t`, `lex`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an integer value provided by the user input minus 1 if `lex` was less than or equal to 26, otherwise `lex` is `lex - 26`, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is either [1, 1, 26], [26, 1, 26], [1, 26, 26], or [26, 26, 26] depending on the initial value of `lex`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `k` is 3.**
