Let's break down the problem step-by-step using the given initial state:

1. **Variable `t`**: This is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 100`. The exact value of `t` is not relevant for determining the output of the print statement.

2. **Variable `lex`**: This is an integer that is adjusted based on its initial value but is guaranteed to be less than 26. The exact value of `lex` is not provided, but we know it is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive).

3. **Variable `cases`**: This is an integer greater than 2. The exact value of `cases` is not relevant for determining the output of the print statement.

4. **List `arr`**: This list can be one of three possible configurations:
   - `[1, 1, lex]`
   - `[1, lex, 26]`
   - `[lex, 26, 26]`

5. **Indices `i`, `j`, `k`**: These are integers with the following values:
   - `i` is 2
   - `j` is 0
   - `k` is 1

The print statement in question is:
```python
print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
```

To determine what is printed, we need to look at the value of `arr[k]`. Since `k` is 1, we need to consider the second element of the list `arr`.

Let's go through the possible configurations of `arr`:

- If `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`, then `arr[k]` (where `k` is 1) is `1`.
- If `arr` is `[1, lex, 26]`, then `arr[k]` (where `k` is 1) is `lex`.
- If `arr` is `[lex, 26, 26]`, then `arr[k]` (where `k` is 1) is `26`.

In each case, we need to convert `arr[k] + 96` to a character using the `chr()` function.

- If `arr[k]` is `1`, then `chr(arr[k] + 96)` is `chr(1 + 96)` which is `chr(97)` and corresponds to the character `'a'`.
- If `arr[k]` is `lex`, then `chr(arr[k] + 96)` is `chr(lex + 96)`. Since `lex` is an integer between 0 and 25, `lex + 96` will be an integer between 96 and 121, which correspond to the characters `'a'` to `'y'`.
- If `arr[k]` is `26`, then `chr(arr[k] + 96)` is `chr(26 + 96)` which is `chr(122)` and corresponds to the character `'z'`.

Given that `lex` is less than 26, the value of `chr(arr[k] + 96)` can be any character from `'a'` to `'z'` depending on the exact value of `lex`.

Since the exact value of `lex` is not provided, we can't determine a single specific character. However, we can describe the output in terms of `lex`.

Output: **chr(lex + 96) (where lex is an integer less than 26)**
