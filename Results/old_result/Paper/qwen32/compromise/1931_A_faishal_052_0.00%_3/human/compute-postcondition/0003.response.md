Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer, and for each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78; `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list.**

In simple terms: The variable `lex` is now assigned the value of an input integer, while the other variables remain unchanged.
