The code snippet `arr = []` reassigns the variable `arr` to an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, lex is an integer, if it was initially less than or equal to 26 then lex is now lex - 2 (and thus less than or equal to 24), otherwise lex is lex - 27 if it was initially between 26 and 51, or lex - 52 if it was initially between 52 and 77, cases is greater than 2, arr is [], and `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3**.
