Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `lex` is an integer, if it was initially less than or equal to 26 then `lex` is now `lex - 2` (and thus less than or equal to 24), otherwise `lex` is `lex - 27` if it was initially between 26 and 51, or `lex - 52` if it was initially between 52 and 77, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list that is either `[1, 1, 1]`, `[26, 1, 1]`, `[1, 26, 1]`, or `[26, 26, 1]`, and `j` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `arr` is updated to include an additional element `1` at the end, making it a list of three elements. The values of `t`, `lex`, `cases`, and `j` remain unchanged.
