Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value: if `lex` was less than or equal to 26, it is decreased by 2 if `lex` <= 26, otherwise it is decreased by 27. If `lex` was greater than 26, it is decreased by 52 if `lex` <= 26, otherwise it is decreased by 52. `cases` is greater than 2. `arr` is either [1, 1, 1], [26, 1, 1], [1, 26, 1], [26, 26, 1], [1, 1, 26], [26, 1, 26], [1, 26, 26], or [26, 26, 26] depending on the initial value of `lex`. `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `k` is 3.**

To simplify the explanation:
- If `lex` was initially less than or equal to 26:
  - `lex` is decreased by 2.
  - `arr` is one of [1, 1, 1], [26, 1, 1], [1, 26, 1], or [26, 26, 1].
- If `lex` was initially greater than 26:
  - `lex` is decreased by 52.
  - `arr` is one of [1, 1, 26], [26, 1, 26], [1, 26, 26], or [26, 26, 26].
- `t`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged as specified in the precondition.
