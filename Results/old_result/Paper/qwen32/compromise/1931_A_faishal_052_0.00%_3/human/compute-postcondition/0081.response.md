The `arr.sort()` function sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. Given the initial possible states of `arr`, we can determine the sorted states:

1. If `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`, sorting it results in `[1, 1, lex]` (no change since it is already sorted).
2. If `arr` is `[1, 26, lex]` and `lex < 26`, sorting it results in `[1, lex, 26]`.
3. If `arr` is `[26, 1, lex]` and `lex < 26`, sorting it results in `[1, lex, 26]`.
4. If `arr` is `[26, 26, lex]` and `lex < 26`, sorting it results in `[lex, 26, 26]`.

The other variables `t`, `lex`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are not affected by the sorting operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value but is less than 26, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is either `[1, 1, lex]`, `[1, lex, 26]`, or `[lex, 26, 26]`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `k` is 3.**
