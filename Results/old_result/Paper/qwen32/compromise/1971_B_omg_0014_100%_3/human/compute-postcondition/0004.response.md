Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a string `s` of lowercase English letters. For each string, it checks if all characters are the same. If they are, it outputs 'NO'. Otherwise, it outputs 'YES' and then prints the string in sorted order, either ascending or descending, depending on whether the original string is already in ascending order.**
