To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is 19 (this variable is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- `s` is the string from the input.
- `p` is `'ABCDEFG'` (this variable is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `ans` is calculated as `3 * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Analysis:
The variable `ans` is defined as:
\[ \text{ans} = 3 \times m + \sum_{i \in \text{hmp}} (\text{m} - \text{hmp}[i]) \text{ for } \text{hmp}[i] < m \]

However, the dictionary `hmp` is not defined in the initial state. Since `hmp` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. But we can describe its formula based on the given information.

### Output Explanation:
The value of `ans` is calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{ans} = 3 \times m + \sum_{i \in \text{hmp}} (\text{m} - \text{hmp}[i]) \text{ for } \text{hmp}[i] < m \]

Where:
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- `hmp` is a dictionary whose keys and values are not specified in the initial state.

Since `hmp` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact value of `ans`. However, we can describe the formula used to compute `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is calculated as 3 * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m) and hmp is a dictionary whose keys and values are not specified)**
