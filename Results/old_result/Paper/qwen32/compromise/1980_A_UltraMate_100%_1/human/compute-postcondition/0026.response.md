Output State: **`ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`. `hmp` must contain at least one item, and `i` is `next_next_key` where `next_next_key` is the next key in `hmp`.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding the difference between `m` and the value of `hmp[i]`. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
