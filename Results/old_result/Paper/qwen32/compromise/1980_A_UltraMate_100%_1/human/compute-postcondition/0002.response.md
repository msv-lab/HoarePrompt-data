The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. This means that the values of `n` and `m` will be updated based on the user's input, while the values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `m` are integers input by the user such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'**.
