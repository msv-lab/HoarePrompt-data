Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: - The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `p`, and `hmp` remain unchanged.
   - `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in `p` that is not present in `s`.

Since `p` contains the characters `'A'`, `'B'`, `'C'`, `'D'`, `'E'`, `'F'`, and `'G'`, and `ans` is incremented by `m` for each character in `p` that is not in `s`, the final value of `ans` will be `m` multiplied by the number of characters in `p` that are not in `s`.

Let's denote the number of characters in `p` that are not in `s` as `count_not_in_s`. Then, the final value of `ans` will be `m * count_not_in_s`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact characters in `s`, we can only express the final state in terms of `m` and `count_not_in_s`.

However, if we assume that `s` does not contain any of the characters in `p` (which is the worst-case scenario for `ans`), then `count_not_in_s` would be 7, and `ans` would be `7 * m`.

Output State:
Code of the loop:
for i in hmp:
    if hmp[i] < m:
        ans += m - hmp[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `p`, and `hmp` remain unchanged. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `ans` is updated to `ans + (m - hmp[i])`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `p`, and `hmp` remain unchanged. `i` is the next key in `hmp` for the next iteration. If `hmp[i] < m`, then `ans` is updated to `ans + m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `p`, and `hmp` remain unchanged. `i` is the next key in `hmp` for the next iteration. If `hmp[i] < m`, `ans` is updated to `ans + m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
