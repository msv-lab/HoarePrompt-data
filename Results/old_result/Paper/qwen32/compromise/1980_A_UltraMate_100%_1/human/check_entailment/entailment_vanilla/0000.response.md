Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to verify its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create for `m` rounds, where each round requires exactly one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of problems in the bank) and `m` (number of rounds).
   - It then reads a string `s` of length `n` representing the difficulty levels of the problems in the bank.

2. **Counting Problem Levels**:
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating the Required Problems**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the number of additional problems needed.
   - It iterates through each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G' (stored in the string `p`).
   - For each difficulty level `i`:
     - If `i` is not in the `Counter` object (`hmp`), it means there are no problems of that difficulty level in the bank. Therefore, Vlad needs to create `m` problems of that level, so `ans` is incremented by `m`.
     - If `i` is in `hmp` but the count (`hmp[i]`) is less than `m`, it means there are not enough problems of that level. Vlad needs to create `m - hmp[i]` more problems of that level, so `ans` is incremented by `m - hmp[i]`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing each test case, the program prints the value of `ans`, which is the minimum number of additional problems needed.

### Verification
The logic of the program correctly handles the requirements of the problem. It ensures that for each of the 7 difficulty levels, there are at least `m` problems available for the `m` rounds. If a difficulty level is missing or insufficient in the bank, the program calculates the exact number of additional problems needed and adds it to the total.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the minimum number of additional problems required for each test case.

**Correctness:** **True**
