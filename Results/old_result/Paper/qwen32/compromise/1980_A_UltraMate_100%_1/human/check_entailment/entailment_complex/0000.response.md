### Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem by iterating through each test case and calculating the minimum number of additional problems needed to ensure that each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') appears at least `m` times across `m` rounds.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`.
   - It then reads a string `s` of length `n` representing the difficulty levels of the existing problems.

2. **Counting Existing Problems**:
   - The program uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed**:
   - It initializes a variable `ans` to zero, which will store the total number of additional problems needed.
   - It iterates over each possible difficulty level 'A' to 'G' (stored in string `p`).
     - If a difficulty level is not present in the `Counter` (i.e., it does not exist in the input string `s`), it adds `m` to `ans` because all `m` rounds need a problem of that difficulty level.
     - If a difficulty level is present but its count is less than `m`, it adds the difference `(m - hmp[i])` to `ans` to ensure that there are at least `m` problems of that difficulty level.
   
4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of additional problems required.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `10 1` and `BGECDCBDED`
- The counts are: `B: 2`, `G: 2`, `E: 2`, `C: 2`, `D: 3`
- Missing levels: `A, F`
- Additional problems needed: `2` (one for `A` and one for `F`)

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `10 2` and `BGECDCBDED`
- The counts are: `B: 2`, `G: 2`, `E: 2`, `C: 2`, `D: 3`
- Missing levels: `A, F`
- Additional problems needed for each level: `2` (since `m=2`)
- Total additional problems needed: `2 + 2 = 4` (for `A`) + `2` (for `F`) + `1` (for `G`) + `1` (for `E`) + `1` (for `C`) = `5`

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `9 1` and `BBCDEFFGG`
- The counts are: `B: 2`, `C: 1`, `D: 1`, `E: 1`, `F: 2`, `G: 2`
- Missing levels: `A`
- Additional problems needed: `1` (for `A`)

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case as per the example.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case based on the given constraints and examples.

**Correctness: True**
