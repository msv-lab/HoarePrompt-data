To determine the output state, let's carefully analyze the loop and its effects on the variables. 

The loop iterates `x` times, and in each iteration, it calculates `next_elem` as the element at the next index in the list `a`, wrapping around to the start of the list if necessary (using modulo operation). If it's the last iteration (`i == x - 1`), it adds `n` to `next_elem`. Then, it calculates the `gap` as the difference between `next_elem` and the current element `a[i]`, minus 1. If this `gap` is positive, it appends the `gap` to the `gaps` list.

The variable `ans` is initialized as `x - 2` and is not modified within the loop, so it remains unchanged.

The variable `gaps` starts as an empty list and gets populated with positive gaps calculated during the loop iterations.

Thus, the output state will be:
- `ans` remains `x - 2`.
- `gaps` is a list of positive gaps calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements of `a` (considering the wrap-around for the last element) minus 1, with `n` added to the last element.

Output State: **`ans` is x - 2; `gaps` is a list of positive gaps calculated as described.**
