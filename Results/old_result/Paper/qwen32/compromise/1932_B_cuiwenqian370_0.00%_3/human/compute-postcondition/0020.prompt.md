Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `path` is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', and `n` is the length of `path` with `n` greater than 0. If `n` is 1, `dp` remains a list where the first element is `1` if the first element of `path` is '@', otherwise it is `-float('inf')`, and the rest of `dp` is zeros. If `n` is greater than 1, the first element of `dp` is `1` if the first element of `path` is '@', otherwise it is `-float('inf')`. The second element of `dp` is `-float('inf')` if the second element of `path` is '*', otherwise it is `dp[0] + 1` if the second element of `path` is '@', or `dp[0]` if the second element of `path` is not '@'. The rest of `dp` remains zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(2, n):
    if path[i] == '*':
        dp[i] = -float('inf')
    else:
        dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
