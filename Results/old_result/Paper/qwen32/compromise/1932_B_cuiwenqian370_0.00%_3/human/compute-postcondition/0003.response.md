The code snippet simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `index`. The other variables (`path`, `n`, `data`, and `t`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`path` is a string representing a sequence of space-separated integers, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from `path`; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`; `index` is 1.**
