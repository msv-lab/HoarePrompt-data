### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not solve the given problem. The code is designed to handle a different problem involving a sequence of '@' and '*' characters, which is unrelated to the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur based on the periodicity of each sign.

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to confirm this:

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicity of each sign.
2. **Input**: 
   - The number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, the number of signs, `n`, and a list of `n` integers representing the periodicity of each sign.
3. **Output**: For each test case, the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**: This function appears to be designed to handle a sequence of '@' and '*' characters. It uses dynamic programming to calculate some value based on the sequence.
- **Function `func_2`**: This function reads input from standard input, processes each test case by calling `func_1` on a string (which is not the correct input format for the problem), and prints the results.

The code does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it does not:
- Parse the periodicity of each sign.
- Calculate the year in which each sign occurs sequentially based on the given periodicity.

#### Annotations:
The annotations confirm that the code is processing a sequence of '@' and '*' characters and not the periodicity of the signs as required by the problem. The annotations do not provide any evidence that the code can be adapted to solve the given problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect for the given problem. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
