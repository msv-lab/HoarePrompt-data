Reasoning:  
The given problem is about determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicity of each sign. The provided code, however, does not address this problem at all. Instead, it seems to be solving a different problem related to a path with '@' and '*' characters, which is not relevant to the given problem description.

The problem requires us to find the year when each sign occurs sequentially, based on the periodicity of each sign, starting from year 1. The code provided does not implement this logic at all. It appears to be a solution to a different problem where '@' and '*' characters are evaluated in some way, which is not related to the periodicity of signs.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
