Output State: **t test cases have been processed, and for each test case, either 'Bob' or 'Alice' has been printed based on whether the absolute difference between a and b is even or odd, respectively. The values of t, a, and b from the initial state are no longer relevant as they have been used and are not retained after the loop completes.**
