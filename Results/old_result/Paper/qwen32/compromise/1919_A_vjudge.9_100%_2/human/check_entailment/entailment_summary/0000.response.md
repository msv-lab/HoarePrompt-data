### Reasoning:

The game described involves Alice and Bob taking turns to either swap their wallets or not, and then removing one coin from their current wallet. The game ends when a player cannot make a move (i.e., when both wallets are empty). The problem requires us to determine the winner if both players play optimally.

The key insight here is that the game can be reduced to the parity (odd or even nature) of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. If the absolute difference is even, Bob wins; if it is odd, Alice wins. This is because:

- If the difference is even, Alice can always make a move that leaves an odd difference for Bob, and vice versa. Bob will eventually be forced into a position where he cannot make a move when the difference becomes zero.
- If the difference is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves an even difference for Bob, and Bob will eventually be forced into a losing position.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the absolute difference between `a` and `b` for each test case and printing 'Bob' for even differences and 'Alice' for odd differences.
