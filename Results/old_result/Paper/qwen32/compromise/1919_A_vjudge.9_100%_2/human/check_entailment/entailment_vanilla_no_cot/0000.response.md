To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic behind the game and the provided solution.

The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns to either swap their wallets or keep them, then removing one coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a move loses. Both players play optimally, meaning they make the best possible moves to win.

The key insight here is that the game can be analyzed based on the parity (odd or even nature) of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. 

- If the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even, then Bob wins.
- If the absolute difference is odd, then Alice wins.

This is because:
- If the difference is even, Alice will always face a situation where her optimal move leaves Bob with an even difference, and Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, leading to Bob's victory.
- If the difference is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob with an even difference, forcing Bob into a losing position.

Let's verify the provided program against this logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

The program correctly checks the parity of the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and prints "Bob" if the difference is even and "Alice" if the difference is odd, which aligns with our analysis.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
