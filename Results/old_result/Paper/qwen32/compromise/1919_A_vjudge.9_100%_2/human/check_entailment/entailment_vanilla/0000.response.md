To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the problem and the logic used in the code.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who have a certain number of coins in their wallets. The players take turns, with Alice starting first. On each turn, a player can either swap wallets with the other player or keep their current wallet. Then, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., when their wallet is empty and they cannot swap to a non-empty wallet) loses the game.

### Key Observations

1. **Game Dynamics**: The game essentially revolves around the parity (odd or even) of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
2. **Winning Strategy**: If the difference between the number of coins in their wallets is even, Bob will win if both play optimally. If the difference is odd, Alice will win.

### Explanation of the Code

The code reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the number of coins `a` and `b` in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. It then checks the parity of the absolute difference between `a` and `b` using `abs(a - b) % 2`. If the result is 0 (even), it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice".

### Verification

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1: `a = 1`, `b = 1`**
   - `abs(1 - 1) % 2 == 0`, so Bob wins.
2. **Test Case 2: `a = 1`, `b = 4`**
   - `abs(1 - 4) % 2 == 1`, so Alice wins.
3. **Test Case 3: `a = 5`, `b = 3`**
   - `abs(5 - 3) % 2 == 0`, so Bob wins.
4. **Test Case 4: `a = 4`, `b = 5`**
   - `abs(4 - 5) % 2 == 1`, so Alice wins.
5. **Test Case 5: `a = 11`, `b = 9`**
   - `abs(11 - 9) % 2 == 0`, so Bob wins.
6. **Test Case 6: `a = 83`, `b = 91`**
   - `abs(83 - 91) % 2 == 0`, so Bob wins.
7. **Test Case 7: `a = 1032`, `b = 9307`**
   - `abs(1032 - 9307) % 2 == 1`, so Alice wins.
8. **Test Case 8: `a = 839204`, `b = 7281`**
   - `abs(839204 - 7281) % 2 == 1`, so Alice wins.
9. **Test Case 9: `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`**
   - `abs(1000000000 - 1000000000) % 2 == 0`, so Bob wins.
10. **Test Case 10: `a = 53110`, `b = 2024`**
    - `abs(53110 - 2024) % 2 == 0`, so Bob wins.

The program's logic matches the expected outcomes for all the provided test cases.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the parity of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

**Correctness: True**
