You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it prints 'Bob' if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, and 'Alice' if the absolute difference is odd.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze the game rules and the given solution.

### Game Analysis:

The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns to either swap their wallets or keep their current wallets and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a move loses. Both players play optimally.

#### Key Observations:

1. **Initial State:** The game starts with Alice having `a` coins and Bob having `b` coins.
2. **Turns:** Alice moves first, and then they alternate turns.
3. **Moves:**
   - Swap wallets or keep the current wallet.
   - Remove one coin from the current wallet.
4. **Winning Condition:** The player who cannot make a move loses.

#### Strategy:

- If the difference `abs(a - b)` between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even, Bob wins.
- If the difference `abs(a - b)` is odd, Alice wins.

### Explanation of the Program:

The provided program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the number of coins `a` and `b` in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. It then checks the parity of the absolute difference `abs(a - b)` and prints "Bob" if the difference is even and "Alice" if the difference is odd.

### Verification:

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case: a=1, b=1**
   - `abs(1 - 1) = 0` (even) -> Bob wins.
2. **Test Case: a=1, b=4**
   - `abs(1 - 4) = 3` (odd) -> Alice wins.
3. **Test Case: a=5, b=3**
   - `abs(5 - 3) = 2` (even) -> Bob wins.
4. **Test Case: a=4, b=5**
   - `abs(4 - 5) = 1` (odd) -> Alice wins.
5. **Test Case: a=11, b=9**
   - `abs(11 - 9) = 2` (even) -> Bob wins.
6. **Test Case: a=83, b=91**
   - `abs(83 - 91) = 8` (even) -> Bob wins.
7. **Test Case: a=1032, b=9307**
   - `abs(1032 - 9307) = 8275` (odd) -> Alice wins.
8. **Test Case: a=839204, b=7281**
   - `abs(839204 - 7281) = 831923` (odd) -> Alice wins.
9. **Test Case: a=1000000000, b=1000000000**
   - `abs(1000000000 - 1000000000) = 0` (even) -> Bob wins.
10. **Test Case: a=53110, b=2024**
    - `abs(53110 - 2024) = 51086` (even) -> Bob wins.

The program correctly determines the winner for each test case based on the parity of the difference between `a` and `b`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the optimal play strategy.

Reasoning: The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The logic aligns with the optimal play strategy derived from the game rules.
