### Reasoning:
The provided program and its function summary correctly determine the winner of the game based on the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins Alice and Bob have. Let's break down the game mechanics and the program logic to confirm the correctness:

1. **Game Analysis**:
   - The game revolves around the parity (odd or even nature) of the difference in the number of coins between Alice and Bob.
   - If the initial difference between the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves. This means that whatever move Alice makes, Bob can make an equivalent move to keep the difference even until Alice is forced into a position where she cannot make a move.
   - If the initial difference between the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is odd, Alice can force Bob into a losing position. Alice can make a move that changes the parity of the difference to even, and then mirror Bob's moves until Bob is forced into a position where he cannot make a move.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It calculates the absolute difference between the coins in both wallets.
   - It checks the parity of this difference:
     - If the difference is even (`abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`), it prints "Bob".
     - If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

3. **Examples**:
   - For the input `1 1`, the difference is `0` (even), so Bob wins.
   - For the input `1 4`, the difference is `3` (odd), so Alice wins.
   - For the input `5 3`, the difference is `2` (even), so Bob wins.
   - For the input `4 5`, the difference is `1` (odd), so Alice wins.
   - For the input `1000000000 1000000000`, the difference is `0` (even), so Bob wins.

The provided program handles all these cases correctly based on the provided problem description and the analysis of the game's mechanics. The function summary accurately describes the logic of the program, and the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
