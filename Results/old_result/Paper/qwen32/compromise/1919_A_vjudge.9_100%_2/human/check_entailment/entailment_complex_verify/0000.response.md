To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the game mechanics and the program logic. The original assessment suggests that the program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins Alice and Bob have. Let's break down the reasoning and verify it step by step.

### Game Analysis
The game mechanics can be understood through the following observations:
1. **Initial State**: Alice and Bob have `a` and `b` coins respectively.
2. **Turns**: Players take turns, with Alice starting first.
3. **Moves**:
   - A player can choose to swap wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet.
   - After choosing (or not choosing) to swap, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
4. **Winning Condition**: The player who cannot make a valid move loses the game.

### Key Insight
The key insight is that the game can be reduced to the parity of the difference between the number of coins Alice and Bob have:
- If the difference `abs(a - b)` is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves and force Alice into a losing position.
- If the difference `abs(a - b)` is odd, Alice can force Bob into a losing position by making the difference even on Bob's turn.

### Program Logic
The provided program correctly implements this insight:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
2. **Difference Calculation**: For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference `abs(a - b)`.
3. **Parity Check**: It checks if the difference is even or odd:
   - If even (`abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`), it prints "Bob".
   - If odd, it prints "Alice".

### Verification Using Annotations
The annotations confirm that the program processes each test case correctly:
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `a` and `b`.
- It calculates `abs(a - b)` and checks its parity.
- It prints the correct winner based on the parity of the difference.

### Conclusion
Given the problem description, the program logic, and the verification through annotations, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins Alice and Bob have.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
