Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins Alice and Bob have. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Game Analysis**:
   - The game revolves around the parity (odd or even nature) of the difference in the number of coins between Alice and Bob.
   - If the difference is even, Bob wins because he can always mirror Alice's moves.
   - If the difference is odd, Alice wins because she can force Bob into a losing position.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It calculates the absolute difference between the coins in both wallets.
   - It checks the parity of this difference:
     - If the difference is even (`abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`), it prints "Bob".
     - If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

3. **Examples**:
   - For the input `1 1`, the difference is `0` (even), so Bob wins.
   - For the input `1 4`, the difference is `3` (odd), so Alice wins.
   - For the input `5 3`, the difference is `2` (even), so Bob wins.
   - For the input `4 5`, the difference is `1` (odd), so Alice wins.
   - For the input `1000000000 1000000000`, the difference is `0` (even), so Bob wins.
   
The program handles all these cases correctly based on the provided problem description and the analysis of the game's mechanics. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
