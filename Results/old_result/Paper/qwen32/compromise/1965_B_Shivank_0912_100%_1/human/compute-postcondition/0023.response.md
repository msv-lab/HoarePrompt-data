To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State Analysis:
- The list `ans` is described as containing specific values: `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding the value `2^i`.

### Breakdown of the List:
- The list contains a mix of values derived from `k` and powers of 2, specifically `1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072`.
- Additionally, it includes three values derived from `k` and `i`: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`.
- The value `2^i` (which is equivalent to `1 << i`) is excluded from the list.

### Determining the Length of the List:
- The list initially has 21 elements (from `1` to `131072` inclusive).
- One element (`2^i`) is excluded from this list.
- Therefore, the length of the list `ans` is `21 - 1 = 20`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(len(ans))` statement will print the length of the list `ans`, which is `20`.

### Final Output:
Output: **20**
