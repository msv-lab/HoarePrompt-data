To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is just `j`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for j in range(20):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` had some value. Since the loop iterates over the range from 0 to 19 (inclusive), `j` would have been incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Let's break it down:

- The loop variable `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
- The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than 20.

So, if `j` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize that `j` will simply be incremented by 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, the list is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding the value `2^i`, `tc` is 2, `i` is the largest integer such that `2^(i + 1) > k`, `j` is `j + 1`**.

However, to provide a more concrete example, let's assume `j` was 5 at the end of the previous iteration. Then at the start of the next iteration, `j` would be 6.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, the list is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding the value `2^i`, `tc` is 2, `i` is the largest integer such that `2^(i + 1) > k`, `j` is 6**.

Generalizing, if `j` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, the list is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding the value `2^i`, `tc` is 2, `i` is the largest integer such that `2^(i + 1) > k`, `j` is `j + 1`**.
