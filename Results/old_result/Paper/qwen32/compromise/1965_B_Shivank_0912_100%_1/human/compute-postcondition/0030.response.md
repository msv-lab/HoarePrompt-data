To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head: `1 << i + 1 <= k`.

Given:
- `n` is an input integer (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `k` must be at least 2.
- The list is defined but not directly relevant to the loop condition.
- `tc` is 2 (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `i` is 1.

The loop condition `1 << i + 1 <= k` needs to be true for the loop to execute again. Let's break this down:

- `1 << i` means `2^i`.
- Given `i` is 1, `1 << i` is `2^1` which equals 2.
- The condition then becomes `1 << (i + 1) <= k`, which translates to `2^(i + 1) <= k`.
- Since `i` is 1, `2^(i + 1)` is `2^2` which equals 4.
- Therefore, the condition simplifies to `4 <= k`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` must be at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be at least 4.

No other states need to be adjusted because the loop condition only involves `i` and `k`, and `i` is already set to 1.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 4, the list is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding the value `2^i`, `tc` is 2, `i` is 1**
