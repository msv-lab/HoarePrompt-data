To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

```
while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the expression `1 << i + 1 <= k` evaluates to `True`. Here, `1 << i` represents a left shift operation, which is equivalent to \(2^i\). Therefore, the condition can be rewritten as:

\[ 2^{i+1} \leq k \]

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- The list is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding the value `2^i`
- `tc` is 2
- `i` is 0

Since `i` is 0, the condition becomes:

\[ 2^{0+1} \leq k \]
\[ 2 \leq k \]

Thus, for the loop to execute, `k` must be at least 2. Since `k` is already given as an input integer, we need to ensure that `k` meets this requirement.

No other variables (`n`, `tc`, or the list) are involved in the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 2, the list is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding the value `2^i`, `tc` is 2, `i` is 0**
