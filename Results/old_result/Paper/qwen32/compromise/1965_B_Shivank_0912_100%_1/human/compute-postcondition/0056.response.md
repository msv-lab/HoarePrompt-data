To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop:

```
while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This condition translates to checking if \(2^{(i + 1)} \leq k\).

Given the current state:
- `n` is an input integer (we don't need to adjust this as it's not part of the loop condition).
- `k` must be at least 8 (this is already given and doesn't need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time).
- `i` is 2.
- The list and `ans` are defined but are not part of the loop condition.

Let's analyze the condition with the current value of `i`:
- With `i = 2`, the condition becomes \(2^{(2 + 1)} \leq k\) or \(2^3 \leq k\) which simplifies to \(8 \leq k\).

Since `k` must be at least 8, the condition \(8 \leq k\) is satisfied. However, to ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to verify if increasing `i` by 1 would still satisfy the condition.

If we increase `i` by 1, then `i` becomes 3, and the condition becomes \(2^{(3 + 1)} \leq k\) or \(2^4 \leq k\) which simplifies to \(16 \leq k\).

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `k` must be at least 16.

So, the state needs to be adjusted such that `k` is at least 16 and `i` remains 2 for the current iteration.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 16, `i` is 2, the list is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding the value `2^i`, `tc` is 3, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding `2^i`**
