Postcondition: **`T` is an integer such that 0 <= `T` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, `a[l]` and `a[r]` are each decreased by `mi`, `r` is set to `n-2` if `a[r]` was 0 and `ans` is incremented by 1, `l` is set to 1 if `a[l]` was 0, or 2 if `a[l]` was 1 and `a[l]` was 0, and `mi` is recalculated as the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the operation. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is set to `k % 2`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, or if either `a[0]` or `a[r]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, or set based on `mi - t - k // 2` if `mi * 2 > k`.**
