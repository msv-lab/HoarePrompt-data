Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 0 <= `T` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `l` is 0 or 1 if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `l` remains 0; `r` is `n-1`; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`; `t` is `k % 2`. If `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by 1 if either `a[0]` or `a[r]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, or set based on `mi - t - k // 2` if `mi * 2 > k`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
