Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15. `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9 for each i. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `T` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `T` is now an integer input by the user, and it satisfies the condition 1 <= `T` <= 10^4. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `a`) remain unchanged as no operations have been performed on them yet.
