The code snippet `a[r] -= mi` decreases the value at index `r` of the list `a` by `mi`. Given the initial state, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. Since `a[r]` is initially `a[n - 1]`, after the operation, `a[r]` becomes `a[n - 1] - mi`.

Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` where `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` is decreased by `mi` and `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `ans` is 0, `T` is truthy and has been decremented by 1, `mi` is `min(a[0], a[n - 1])`, and `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`.**
