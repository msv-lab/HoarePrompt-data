The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `l` is 0 or 1
- `r` is `n - 1` where `n` is greater than 1
- `k` is greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` and `a[r]` are decreased by `mi`
- `ans` is 2 if `a[l]` was 0, otherwise `ans` remains 1
- `T` is truthy and has been decremented by 1
- `mi` is `min(a[0], a[n - 1])`
- `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`
- If `a[l]` was 0, then `a[l]` is 0
- The current value of `a[r]` is 0

After executing `r -= 1`, `r` becomes `n - 2`.

Output State: **`l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 2`, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` are decreased by `mi`, `ans` is 2 if `a[l]` was 0, otherwise `ans` remains 1, `T` is truthy and has been decremented by 1, `mi` is `min(a[0], a[n - 1])`, `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`, if `a[l]` was 0, then `a[l]` is 0, the current value of `a[r]` is 0.**
