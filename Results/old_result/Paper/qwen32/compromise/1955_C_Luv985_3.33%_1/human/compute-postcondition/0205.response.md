Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is 0 or less, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `k >= a[n - 1]`, `a` is a list of integers, `T` is 0. If `l` is equal to `r`, `ans` is determined based on the comparison between `k` and `a[n - 1]`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans`.**
