Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 0 <= `T` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is 0; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`.**

In natural language, this means that the variable `mi` has been assigned the value of the smaller element between the first and last elements of the list `a`. All other variables retain their initial values.
