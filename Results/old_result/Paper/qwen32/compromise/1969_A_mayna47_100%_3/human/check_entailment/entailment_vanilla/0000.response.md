Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis

Monocarp wants to invite his friends to a party with the condition that for each friend to attend, both that friend and their best friend must receive an invitation. The goal is to find the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least two friends attend the party.

### Key Points:
1. **Invitations Requirement**: A friend `i` will attend the party only if both `i` and `p_i` (best friend of `i`) are invited.
2. **Objective**: Find the minimum number of invitations to ensure at least two friends attend the party.
3. **Constraints**: 
   - `1 <= t <= 5000` (number of test cases)
   - `2 <= n <= 50` (number of friends)
   - `p_i` are distinct and `p_i != i`

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program to see if it correctly solves the problem.

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
    print(3)
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` to process the input and compute the result.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - Reads the number of friends `n`.
   - Reads the list of best friends `p_i` into a list `v` (with an offset to make it 1-indexed).

3. **Logic for Minimum Invitations**:
   - The program iterates through each friend `i` from `1` to `n`.
   - It checks if `v[v[i]] == i`. This condition checks if `i` and `p_i` form a mutual best friendship (cycle of length 2).
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` because only two invitations are needed (one for `i` and one for `p_i`).
   - If no such pair is found after checking all friends, it prints `3`.

### Correctness Analysis:

The logic in the program is flawed. Here are the issues:

1. **Cycle of Length 2**:
   - The program correctly identifies mutual best friendships (cycle of length 2) and correctly returns `2` in this case.
   
2. **Other Cases**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that if no mutual best friendships are found, the answer is always `3`. However, there could be cases where more complex cycles or structures require fewer than `3` invitations to ensure at least two friends attend.

### Counterexample:

Consider the following test case:

```
1
4
2 3 4 1
```

- In this case, each friend is the best friend of the next friend in a cycle of length 4.
- The program will not find any mutual best friendships (cycle of length 2), so it will print `3`.
- However, only `2` invitations are needed (e.g., invite friends `1` and `2`).

### Conclusion:

The program does not handle all cases correctly. It only correctly identifies the case of mutual best friendships (cycle of length 2) but fails to correctly determine the minimum number of invitations for other structures.

**Correctness: False**
