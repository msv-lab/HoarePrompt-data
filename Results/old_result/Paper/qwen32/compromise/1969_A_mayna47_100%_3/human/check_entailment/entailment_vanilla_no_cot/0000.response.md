Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send in all scenarios. Specifically, the logic in the function `func_1` only checks for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and immediately returns 2 if such a pair is found. However, if no such pair exists, the program incorrectly assumes that 3 invitations are always necessary. 

In some cases, it might be possible to invite 2 friends who are not each other's best friends but still manage to bring at least 2 friends to the party. For example, consider the case where the best friend relationships form a cycle of more than 2 people (e.g., a cycle of 3 or 4 friends), it might be possible to invite just 2 people to bring 2 or more people to the party. The current program does not account for these scenarios and will always output 3 if no mutual best friend pair is found, which is not always correct. 

To correctly solve the problem, a more thorough analysis of the best friend relationships is required, potentially involving checking different combinations of invitations to find the minimum number required to bring at least 2 friends to the party.
