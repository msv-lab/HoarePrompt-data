The given code snippet contains nested loops that iterate over certain ranges and perform a conditional check involving the greatest common divisor (GCD). However, the code does not modify any of the variables `t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, or `b`. It only prints certain pairs `(i, j)` that meet the condition specified in the `if` statement.

Since none of the variables are modified and no return statement is present, the values of `t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The only effect of the code is potential print statements to the console, which do not affect the state of the variables.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`.**
