Output State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of substrings from the input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `suma` is 0, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been calculated using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
