The code snippet provided adds the value of `x` to `suma`. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `suma`, which now includes the value of `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is \(i + 1\), `x` is \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\), `suma` is updated to `suma + x`.**
