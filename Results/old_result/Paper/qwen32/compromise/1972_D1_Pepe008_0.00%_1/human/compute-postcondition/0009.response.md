The code snippet `suma += x` increments the value of `suma` by the value of `x`. Given the initial state, `suma` was initially 0, and `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. After executing the code, `suma` will be equal to `x`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `suma` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, and `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0**.
