Output State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of substrings from the input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.**

In simple terms, the value of `x` is calculated using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`, while all other variables retain their initial states with the exception of `i` which has been incremented by 1.
