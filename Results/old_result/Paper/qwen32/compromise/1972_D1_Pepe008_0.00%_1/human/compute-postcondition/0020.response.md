To determine the output of the `print(suma - 1)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculations involved:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line.
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`.
- `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`.
- `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during the iterations where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.

### Calculation of `suma`:
The value of `suma` is derived from a loop that sums up `x` values based on the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`. Here, `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 until the condition fails. The specific formula for `x` is not provided in the initial state, but we can infer that `x` is likely dependent on `i` in some way.

### Final Calculation:
The final value printed is `suma - 1`.

### Explanation:
Given the information, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `suma` without knowing the specific values of `a` and the formula for `x`. However, we can describe the output in terms of `suma`.

### Output Description:
The `print(suma - 1)` statement will print the value of `suma` minus 1. Since `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during the iterations where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, the output will be this sum minus 1.

Output: **suma - 1 (where suma is the sum of all x values calculated during the iterations where a - i * (i - 1) > 0)**
