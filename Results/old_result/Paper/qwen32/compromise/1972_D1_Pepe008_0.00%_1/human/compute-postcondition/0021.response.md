The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t` and `T`. If `t` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1.

Since `t` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be `t + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`, `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during the iterations where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`**
