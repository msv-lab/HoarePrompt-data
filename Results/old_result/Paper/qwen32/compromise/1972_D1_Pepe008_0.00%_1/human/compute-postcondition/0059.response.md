To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses and affects the variables `i`, `x`, and `suma`. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = b`, and for each iteration, it calculates `x` and updates `suma` based on the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `t` is incremented by 1.
   - `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `info` is a list of substrings from the input line.
   - `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`.
   - `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`.
   - `suma` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each `i` from 1 to `b`:
     - Calculate `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
     - If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, add `x` to `suma`.

3. **Final State:**
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `b + 1`.
   - `suma` will hold the accumulated sum of `x` for all valid iterations where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.

Given the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that the loop continues until `i` reaches `b + 1`. The final state will reflect the final value of `i` and the accumulated `suma`.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains incremented by 1.
- `T` remains the same as the input integer.
- `info` remains the same as the input list of substrings.
- `a` remains the integer value of `info[0]`.
- `b` remains the integer value of `info[1]`.
- `i` will be `b + 1`.
- `suma` will be the accumulated sum of `x` for all iterations where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.

Output State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of substrings from the input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`, `i` is `b + 1`, and `suma` is the accumulated sum of `x` for all iterations where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.**

In simple terms, after all iterations, `i` will be one more than `b`, and `suma` will contain the total sum of `x` calculated during the iterations where the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` was satisfied.
