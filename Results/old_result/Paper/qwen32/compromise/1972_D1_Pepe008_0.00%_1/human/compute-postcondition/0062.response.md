Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `m`. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. Specifically, if `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive, and for each of the next `t` lines, `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 2,000,000 inclusive, the function performs some computation (not detailed here) and returns a result for each pair of `n` and `m`. The sum of all `n` and the sum of all `m` across all test cases do not exceed 2,000,000.**
