The code snippet only initializes a new variable `suma` to 0. It does not affect the existing variables `t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, or `b`.

Output State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of substrings from the input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`, `suma` is 0.**
