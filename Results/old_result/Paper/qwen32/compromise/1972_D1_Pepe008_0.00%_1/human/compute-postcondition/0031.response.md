To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, b + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input line.
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`.
- `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1.
- If \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\), then `suma` is equal to \(x\), where \(x\) is calculated as \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\). Otherwise, `suma` remains 0.

Since the loop iterates over `i` starting from 1 up to `b` (inclusive), at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. The variable `b` does not change within the loop.

Therefore, if `i` was some value `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration. The value of `b` remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is \(i + 1\)**.

To be more specific, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 4 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, the state would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is 4**.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, the general form of the state is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is \(i + 1\)**.

So the final answer is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is \(i + 1\)**.
