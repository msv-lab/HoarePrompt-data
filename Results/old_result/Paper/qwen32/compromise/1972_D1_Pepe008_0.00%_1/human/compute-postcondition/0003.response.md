The code snippet assigns the integer value of the first element in the `info` list to `a` and the integer value of the second element in the `info` list to `b`. The values of `t` and `T` remain unchanged. The `info` list is also not modified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`.**
