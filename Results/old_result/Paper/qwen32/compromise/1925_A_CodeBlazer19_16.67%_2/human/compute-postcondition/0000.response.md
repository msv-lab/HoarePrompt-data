The code snippet `t = int(input())` changes the value of `t` to an integer value provided by the input. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 676. After the code executes, `t` will be updated to whatever integer value is provided by the input, but it will still be within the range of 1 to 676 as per the precondition. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by the input such that 1 <= t <= 676; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26.**
