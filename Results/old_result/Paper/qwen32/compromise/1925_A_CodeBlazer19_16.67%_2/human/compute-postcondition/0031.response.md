The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1` (which means `i` has already been incremented by 1 from the previous iteration). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`. Therefore, `i` should be the value it was at the start of the last iteration plus 1.

Given that `s`, `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged except for `i` being incremented, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this.

State: **`s` is a string containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet; `i` is the value it was at the start of the last iteration plus 1; `t` remains unchanged; `n` is the first input integer; `k` is the second input integer.**
