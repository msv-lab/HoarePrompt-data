The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies the ranges for `t`, `n`, and `k`, but since the code only modifies `n` and `k`, the value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by the input such that 1 <= t <= 676; `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.**

In this output state, `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input, while `t` retains its initial value.
