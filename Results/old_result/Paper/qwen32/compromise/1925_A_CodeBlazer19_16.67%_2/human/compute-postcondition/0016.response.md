The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `s` is the string of the first `k` letters of the alphabet, and `i` is some value less than `t`. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`s` is the string of the first `k` letters of the alphabet, `i` is `i + 1`, `t` remains unchanged**
