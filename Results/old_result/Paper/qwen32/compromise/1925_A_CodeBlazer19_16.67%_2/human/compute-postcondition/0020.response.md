The code snippet `s += chr(j)` appends the character representation of the integer `j` to the string `s`. Given the initial state, `s` was an empty string, and after the execution of the code, `s` will contain the character corresponding to the integer value of `j`.

The values of the other variables (`i`, `t`, `n`, `k`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`s` is a string containing the character `chr(j)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is the first input integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1.**
