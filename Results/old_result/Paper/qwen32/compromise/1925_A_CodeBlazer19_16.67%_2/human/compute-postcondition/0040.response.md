To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables are updated.

Given:
- The loop runs from `97` to `k + 97`, which means it will iterate `k` times.
- In each iteration, the character corresponding to `chr(j)` is appended to the string `s`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration.
- `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged throughout the loop.

Let's break down the loop iterations:
- The first iteration (`j = 97`) appends `chr(97)` (which is 'a') to `s`.
- The second iteration (`j = 98`) appends `chr(98)` (which is 'b') to `s`.
- The third iteration (`j = 99`) appends `chr(99)` (which is 'c') to `s`.
- This pattern continues until the `k`-th iteration, where `j = 97 + (k - 1)`, appending `chr(97 + (k - 1))` to `s`.

Thus, after `k` iterations, the string `s` will contain the characters from 'a' to `chr(97 + (k - 1))`, which is the same as the characters from 'a' to `chr(k + 96)`.

The variable `i` will be incremented `k` times, starting from its initial value.

The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the final state of the variables after all iterations is:
- `s`: A string containing characters from 'a' to `chr(k + 96)`.
- `i`: The initial value of `i` plus `k`.
- `t`: Unchanged.
- `n`: Unchanged.
- `k`: Unchanged.

Output State: **s is a string containing characters from 'a' to chr(k + 96), i is the initial value of i plus k, t remains unchanged, n remains unchanged, k remains unchanged.**
