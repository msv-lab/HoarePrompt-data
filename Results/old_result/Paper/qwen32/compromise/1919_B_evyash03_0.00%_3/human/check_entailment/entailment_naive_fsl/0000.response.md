Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array as described in the problem statement. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Logic Flaw in Penalty Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to split the array based on the balance of '+' and '-' characters, but it does not correctly calculate the penalty for each split.
   - The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The program does not account for this correctly. Instead, it only counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds 1 if the balance is positive at the end, which does not reflect the penalty calculation.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Subarrays**:
   - The program does not correctly identify and split the array into subarrays that minimize the total penalty.
   - For example, in the third test case (`+-+-+-`), the program should split the array into `([1,-1],[1,-1],[1,-1])` which results in a penalty of `0 + 0 + 0 = 0`, but the program does not achieve this.

3. **Example of Failure**:
   - Consider the test case `n = 6` with the string `+-+-+-`.
   - The correct optimal split is `([1,-1],[1,-1],[1,-1])` with a penalty of `0`.
   - The provided program will not produce this result and instead will output `3` because it counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds 1 if the balance is positive at the end, which is not the correct penalty calculation.

4. **Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the penalty. It only counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds 1 if the balance is positive at the end, which does not reflect the penalty calculation as defined in the problem statement.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array as described in the problem statement.
