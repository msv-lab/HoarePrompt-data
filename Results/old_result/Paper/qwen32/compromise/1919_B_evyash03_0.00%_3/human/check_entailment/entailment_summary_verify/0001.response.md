### Reasoning

Let's analyze the provided program and the problem requirements step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Understanding
The problem requires us to split the array `a` (derived from the string `s` where `+` maps to `1` and `-` to `-1`) into subarrays to minimize the total penalty. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The goal is to find the optimal split that minimizes this total penalty.

#### Program Analysis
The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal solution for the problem. Here's why:

1. **Splitting Strategy**: The program splits the string `s` based on the character `-` and calculates the length of the parts. However, this approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

2. **Penalty Calculation**: The function `func_1` tries to count the number of times the balance (sum of the subarray) becomes negative and resets it. However, this does not correctly compute the penalty for each subarray or find the optimal split.

3. **Optimal Splitting**: The optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty is not addressed in the program. The program does not consider all possible splits and their penalties.

#### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider dynamic programming or a greedy strategy that optimally splits the array based on the penalty calculation. Here's a brief outline of a correct approach:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum penalty for the subarray `a[0:i]`.
   - Iterate through the array and for each position `i`, consider all possible subarrays ending at `i` and calculate their penalties.
   - Update the `dp` array with the minimum penalty found.

2. **Greedy Approach**:
   - Traverse the array and keep a running balance.
   - Whenever the balance becomes zero, split the array at that point because the penalty for such a subarray is zero.
   - If the balance does not become zero, continue until the end of the array and calculate the penalty for the remaining subarray.

#### Function Summary
The function summary provided states that the function calculates the number of times the balance of '+' and '-' characters in the string `expression` goes negative, resets it to zero, and finally adds one if there is a positive balance left. This summary does not align with the problem requirements for calculating the minimum penalty.

#### Evaluation of Provided Program
The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal solution for the problem. It fails to consider all possible splits and their penalties, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal solution for the problem. It fails to consider all possible splits and their penalties, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
