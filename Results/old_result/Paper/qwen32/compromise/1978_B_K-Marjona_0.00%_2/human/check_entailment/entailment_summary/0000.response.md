### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided program and verify if it correctly computes the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns based on the given conditions.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Determination of `k`:**
   - The program calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This ensures that `k` is the maximum number of buns that can be sold at the modified price without exceeding the number of buns `n` or the range of modified prices `b - a`.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - If `b <= a`, it means the modified price is not beneficial, so Bob sells all buns at the usual price `a`. The profit is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the profit as follows:
     - The sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and ending at `b - k + 1` is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k\).
     - The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`, contributing `(n - k) * a` to the profit.
     - The total profit is the sum of these two components.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated profit for each test case.

### Verification with the Example:
Let's verify the program with the first test case from the example:
- **Input:** `4 4 5`
- **Calculation:**
  - `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = min(4, 1) = 1`
  - Since `b > a`, the profit is calculated as:
    - Sum of the first `k` terms: \((5 + (5 - 1 + 1)) // 2 * 1 = (5 + 5) // 2 * 1 = 5\)
    - Remaining buns: `(4 - 1) * 4 = 3 * 4 = 12`
    - Total profit: `5 + 12 = 17`
- **Output:** `17`

This matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given promotion rules.

**Correctness: True**
