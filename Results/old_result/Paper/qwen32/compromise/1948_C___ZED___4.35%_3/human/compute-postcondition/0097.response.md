The code snippet sets `no_path` to `False`. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `a` is an input string, `b` is the new input string, `no_path` is False, and the current character at index `k` in `b` is not `'>'`.**
