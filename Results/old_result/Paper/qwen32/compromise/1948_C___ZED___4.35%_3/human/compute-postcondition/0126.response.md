The given `print` statement is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown:
- The `print` function is called with the string `'NO'` as its argument.
- There are no variables or dynamic elements in the string that need to be evaluated or replaced.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
