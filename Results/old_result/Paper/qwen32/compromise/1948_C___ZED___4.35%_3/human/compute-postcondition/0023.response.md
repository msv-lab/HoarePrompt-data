The value of `no_path` is changed to `True`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string, `b` is the input string, and the second-to-last character of `b` is '>'. `k` is `n - 2` if `n` is even, or `k` is `n - 3` if `n` is odd. `no_path` is `True`.
