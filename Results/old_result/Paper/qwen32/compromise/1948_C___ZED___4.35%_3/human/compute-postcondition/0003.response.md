The code snippet `b = input()` assigns the value of the input to the variable `b`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `a`, along with the newly assigned value of `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string, `b` is the input string**.
