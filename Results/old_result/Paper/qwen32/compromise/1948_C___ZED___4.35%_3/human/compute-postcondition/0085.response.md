Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string, `b` is the input string, and `no_path` is a boolean indicating whether any character at the odd indices 1, 3, 5, ..., up to the largest odd number less than `n` in `a` is not `'>'`. If `no_path` is `True`, it indicates that at least one character at these odd indices in `a` is not `'>'`. If `no_path` is `False`, all characters at these odd indices in `a` are `'>'`. `k` is the largest odd number less than `n` if `no_path` was `False` initially.**
