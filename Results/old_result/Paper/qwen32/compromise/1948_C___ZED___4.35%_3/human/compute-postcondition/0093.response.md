The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
2. The variable `i` is explicitly set to 2.
3. The variable `n` is an input integer.
4. The variable `a` is an input string.
5. The variable `b` is the new input string.

However, none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This means that the output will be the string 'YES', regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, or `b`.

Output: **YES**
