Postcondition: **`n` is greater than `m + 1`, `m` is `m + 1`, `nabors` is `nabors - 1`, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `aa` is a new list of integers read from the input, `bb` is a new list of integers read from the input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the sublist `aa[:m + 1]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the list `bb`. If `C[in_aa] > 0`, then `C[in_aa]` is increased by 1 if `C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]`, otherwise `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa] > 0`, then `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1 if `E[out_aa] > 0`, otherwise `E[out_aa]` remains unchanged, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1 if `E[out_aa] <= 0`, otherwise `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged. If `D[out_aa] == 0`, then `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. In both cases, `tot` is the sum of the values in the Counter object `D` after the final iteration, and `fnd` is 2 if `tot >= k`, otherwise `fnd` is 1. If `C[in_aa] <= 0`, then `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1.**
