Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nabors` must be greater than 0; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `aa` is a list of integers read from the input; `bb` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the sublist `aa[:m]`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the list `bb`; `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`; `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`; `C` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`; `tot` is the sum of the values in the Counter object `D`; `fnd` is 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
            C[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            D[in_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nabors` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than `m`, `m` and `k` are integers read from the input, `aa` is a list of integers read from the input with at least `n` elements, `bb` is a list of integers read from the input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the sublist `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the list `bb`, `tot` is the sum of the values in the Counter object `D`, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `nabors` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than `m`, `m` and `k` are integers read from the input, `aa` is a list of integers read from the input with at least `n` elements, `bb` is a list of integers read from the input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the sublist `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the list `bb`, `tot` is the sum of the values in the Counter object `D`, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged, `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`, and `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot >= k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `nabors` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than `m`, `m` and `k` are integers read from the input, `aa` is a list of integers read from the input with at least `n` elements, `bb` is a list of integers read from the input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the sublist `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the list `bb`, `tot` is the sum of the values in the Counter object `D`, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged, `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, then `C[in_aa]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1. If `C[in_aa]` equals `D[in_aa]`, then `C[in_aa]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1. If `C[in_aa]` is not greater than 0, then `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
