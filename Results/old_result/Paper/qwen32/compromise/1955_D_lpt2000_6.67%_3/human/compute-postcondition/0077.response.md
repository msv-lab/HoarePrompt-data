Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than `m`, `m` must be less than the length of `aa`. `nabors` is `nabors - 1`, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `aa` is a new list of integers read from the input, `bb` is a new list of integers read from the input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the sublist `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the list `bb`, `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D` after the operation, `C` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D` after the operation`, `tot` is the sum of the values in the Counter object `D` after the final iteration, `fnd` is 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0, and `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0. Additionally, `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0.**
