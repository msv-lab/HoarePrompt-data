Output State: **`n` is greater than `m + 2`, `m` is `m + 2`, `nabors` is `nabors - 1`, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `aa` is a new list of integers read from the input, `bb` is a new list of integers read from the input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the sublist `aa[:m + 2]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the list `bb`, `tot` is the sum of the values in the Counter object `D`, `fnd` is 3 if `tot >= k`, otherwise `fnd` is 2, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.**

In simple terms, the only change is that the value of `E[in_aa]` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previously described states.
