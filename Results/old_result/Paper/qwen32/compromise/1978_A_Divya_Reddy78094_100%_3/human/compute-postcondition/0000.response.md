The provided code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is already an integer within a specific range (1 <= t <= 500). However, the code snippet will overwrite the initial value of `t` with the new input value.

Here is the output state after the code has been executed:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.**

In natural language: The variable `t` is now set to the value of the input integer, which is still within the range of 1 to 500. The other variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged and still satisfy their initial conditions.
