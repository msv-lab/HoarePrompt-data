The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 1 \leq 5 \times 10^4\). This means that at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 to potentially allow the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 2 \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is the smallest non-zero integer such that the condition `s < k` and `k <= s + x` is met; `k` is the second integer from input; `s` is the sum of all `x` values up to the point where the condition is met; `m` is `2` raised to the power of the number of iterations.**
