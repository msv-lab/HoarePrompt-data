The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables; it only terminates the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 2 \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is `n // 2`; `k` is the second integer from input; `s` is `2 * ((n // 2 + 1) // 2)`; `m` is 4; `x` is `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`**.
