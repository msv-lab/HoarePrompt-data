Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer.**

Explanation: The initial state of `t` remains unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are assigned based on the input provided, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer from the input.
