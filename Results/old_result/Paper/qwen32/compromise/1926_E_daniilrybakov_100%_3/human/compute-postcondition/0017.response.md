Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is now \(\left\lfloor \frac{\text{previous } n}{2} \right\rfloor\); `k` is an integer; `s` is \((\text{previous } n + 1) // 2\); `m` is 2; `x` is \((\text{previous } n + 1) // 2\). If `s < k` and `k <= s + x`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
