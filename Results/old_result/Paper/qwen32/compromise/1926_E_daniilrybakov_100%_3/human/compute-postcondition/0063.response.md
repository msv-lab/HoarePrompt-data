The code snippet `n //= 2` updates the value of `n` to its integer division by 2. This means `n` is halved and the result is floored to the nearest integer.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 2 \leq 5 \times 10^4\)
- `n` must be a non-zero integer
- `k` is the second integer from input
- `s` is 0
- `m` is 1
- `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`

After executing `n //= 2`:
- The value of `n` is updated to `n // 2`
- All other variables remain unchanged

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 2 \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is `n // 2`; `k` is the second integer from input; `s` is 0; `m` is 1; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
