The code snippet `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the result back to `n`, effectively halving its value and taking the floor of the result if `n` is odd. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 2 \leq 5 \times 10^4\)
- `n` is greater than 0
- `k` is the second integer from input
- `s` is `2 * ((n + 1) // 2)`
- `m` is 4
- `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\)

After executing `n //= 2`:
- `n` is now `n // 2`
- `s` and `x` are dependent on the new value of `n`, so we need to update them accordingly:
  - `s` becomes `2 * ((n // 2 + 1) // 2)`
  - `x` becomes `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 2 \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is `n // 2`; `k` is the second integer from input; `s` is `2 * ((n // 2 + 1) // 2)`; `m` is 4; `x` is `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`**
