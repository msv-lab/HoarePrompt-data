The code snippet provided is `s += x`, which means the value of `s` is incremented by the value of `x`. Given the initial state, `s` is \((\text{previous } n + 1) // 2\) and `x` is also \((\text{previous } n + 1) // 2\). Therefore, after the operation, `s` will be \((\text{previous } n + 1) // 2 + (\text{previous } n + 1) // 2\), which simplifies to \((\text{previous } n + 1)\).

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`) remain unchanged. The condition `if s < k and k <= s + x` is not evaluated or changed by this statement, so it remains as it was in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is now \(\left\lfloor \frac{\text{previous } n}{2} \right\rfloor\); `k` is an integer; `s` is \((\text{previous } n + 1)\); `m` is 2; `x` is \((\text{previous } n + 1) // 2\). If `s < k` and `k <= s + x`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
