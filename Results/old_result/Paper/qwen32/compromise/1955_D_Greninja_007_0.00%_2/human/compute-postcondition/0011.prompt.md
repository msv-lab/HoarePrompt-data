You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), b is a list of m integers (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), k is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ m), n is the length of list a, and m is the length of list b. Each element in a and b is an integer between 1 and 10^6, inclusive. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(a, b, k, n, m):
    good_subarrays = 0
    b_freq = Counter(b)
    window_freq = Counter(a[:m])
    matches = sum(min(window_freq[x], b_freq[x]) for x in window_freq if x in
    b_freq)
    for i in range(n - m):
        if matches >= k:
            good_subarrays += 1
        
        if a[i] in b_freq:
            matches -= min(window_freq[a[i]], b_freq[a[i]])
        
        window_freq[a[i]] -= 1
        
        if window_freq[a[i]] == 0:
            del window_freq[a[i]]
        
        if a[i + m] in b_freq:
            matches += min(window_freq[a[i + m]] + 1, b_freq[a[i + m]])
        
        window_freq[a[i + m]] += 1
        
    #State: `good_subarrays` is the count of subarrays of length `m` in `a` where the sum of the minimum of the frequencies of each element in the subarray and in `b` is at least `k`. `b_freq` and `window_freq` are the frequency counters for `b` and the last window of `a` respectively. `matches` is the sum of the minimum of the frequencies of each element in the last window and in `b`.
    if (matches >= k) :
        good_subarrays += 1
    #State: `good_subarrays` is the count of subarrays of length `m` in `a` where the sum of the minimum of the frequencies of each element in the subarray and in `b` is at least `k`. If the current value of `matches` is at least `k`, then `good_subarrays` is increased by 1. `b_freq` and `window_freq` are the frequency counters for `b` and the last window of `a` respectively. `matches` is the sum of the minimum of the frequencies of each element in the last window and in `b`.
    return good_subarrays
    #The program returns `good_subarrays` which is the count of subarrays of length `m` in `a` where the sum of the minimum of the frequencies of each element in the subarray and in `b` is at least `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two lists of integers `a` and `b`, an integer `k`, and the lengths of these lists `n` and `m`, respectively. It returns the count of subarrays of length `m` in `a` where the sum of the minimum frequencies of each element in the subarray and in `b` is at least `k`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `good_subarrays` which is the count of subarrays of length `m` in `a` where the sum of the minimum of the frequencies of each element in the subarray and in `b` is at least `k`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
