Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a`, followed by `n` integers representing the elements of the array `a`. It also accepts an integer `q` representing the number of queries, and for each query, it receives two integers `l` and `r` representing the boundaries of the query. The function returns the result for each query, which is not specified in the given information but typically would involve some computation on the subarray defined by `l` and `r`.**
