The code `nums.append(-1)` adds the integer `-1` to the end of the list `nums`. Therefore, the list `nums` now includes all its previous elements plus `-1` at the end. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is assigned the value of the first integer read from the input, `nums` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array `a` with an additional `-1` at the end, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is `nums[0]`, `arr` is an empty list.**
