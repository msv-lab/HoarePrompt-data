The code snippet initializes a variable `ans` as an empty string. This does not affect the values of `s` and `n`, which remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string.**
