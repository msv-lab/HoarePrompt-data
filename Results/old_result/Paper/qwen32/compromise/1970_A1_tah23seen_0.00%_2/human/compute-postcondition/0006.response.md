The code snippet `d.pop(n)` removes the key `n` from the dictionary `d`. Given the initial state, `d` is a dictionary where `d[0]` is `0` and `d[i]` for `1 <= i <= n` represents the cumulative count of open parentheses up to position `i` in `s`, with `d[n]` being `0`.

After executing `d.pop(n)`, the key `n` is removed from `d`, so `d[n]` no longer exists in the dictionary. The values of other keys in `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary where `d[0]` is `0` and `d[i]` for `1 <= i <= n-1` represents the cumulative count of open parentheses up to position `i` in `s`.**
