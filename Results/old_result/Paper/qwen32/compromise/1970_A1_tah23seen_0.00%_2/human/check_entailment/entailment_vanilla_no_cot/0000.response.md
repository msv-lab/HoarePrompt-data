Correctness: **False**

The program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. The dictionary `d` is being used to store the balance of the prefix at each position, but the sorting mechanism is incorrect. The task specifies that the columns should be sorted by prefix balance in increasing order, and in case of ties (same balance), the position should be sorted in decreasing order. The current implementation does not handle the tie-breaking condition correctly.

2. The dictionary `d` is indexed starting from 1 to `n`, but the `sorted` function is called on the dictionary items without considering the tie-breaking rule.

3. The function `func_1` is called after it has been defined, which is correct, but the logic inside the function needs to be revised to match the problem requirements.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance[i + 1] = balance[i] + 1
        else:
            balance[i + 1] = balance[i] - 1

    # Create a list of tuples (position, balance) and sort it
    positions = list(range(1, n + 1))
    positions.sort(key=lambda x: (balance[x], -x))

    # Construct the shuffled sequence
    ans = ''.join(s[x - 1] for x in positions)
    return ans

# Main program
n = input()
print(func_1(n))
```

In this corrected version:
- We maintain a list `balance` where `balance[i]` is the balance of the prefix up to position `i`.
- We create a list of positions and sort it using a lambda function that sorts by balance first and by negative position (to achieve decreasing order in case of ties).
- Finally, we construct the result by joining the characters in the new order.
