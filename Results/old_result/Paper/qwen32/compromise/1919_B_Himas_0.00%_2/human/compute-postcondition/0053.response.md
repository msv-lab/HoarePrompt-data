The only variable in the loop head is `q`, which is the loop variable iterating over the string `e`. Therefore, we need to adjust `q` to the next character in the string `e` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `e` is a string with at least one character, and `i` and `s` are not part of the loop head and do not need adjustment. The variables `P` and `M` depend on the value of `q` and will be recalculated based on the new value of `q`.

Let's assume `q` was the `j`-th character in the string `e` during the previous iteration. For the next iteration, `q` should be the `(j+1)`-th character in the string `e`.

State: **`e` is a string with at least one character, `i` is `i` + len(new `e`), `s` is an input integer, `q` is the next character in `e`**.

To be more specific, if `q` was `e[j]` in the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `q` should be `e[j+1]`.

State: **`e` is a string with at least one character, `i` is `i` + len(new `e`), `s` is an input integer, `q` is the next character in `e` (i.e., `e[j+1]` if `q` was `e[j]` in the previous iteration)**.

Since we don't have the exact position of `q` in `e` from the previous iteration, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`e` is a string with at least one character, `i` is `i` + len(new `e`), `s` is an input integer, `q` is the next character in `e`**.
