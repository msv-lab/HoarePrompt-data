The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which is the loop counter. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the integer value of the input provided.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has some value, and the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the input value. To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1.

Given the information, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`P` is the number of '+' characters in `e`, and `M` is the number of non-'+' characters in `e`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

However, to be more precise, let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `i_prev + 1`.

State: **`P` is the number of '+' characters in `e`, and `M` is the number of non-'+' characters in `e`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`**.

Since we do not have the specific value of `i_prev`, we can simply state that `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

State: **`P` is the number of '+' characters in `e`, and `M` is the number of non-'+' characters in `e`, `i` is incremented by 1**.
