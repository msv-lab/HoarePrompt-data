The only variable in the loop head is `q`, which iterates over each character in the string `e`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `q` to reflect the next character in the string `e`. The variables `P`, `M`, `i`, `s`, and `e` are not part of the loop head and should not be modified.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, we can infer that `i` will be incremented to the next value, but since `i` is not part of the loop head, we do not need to include it in the state adjustment.

The state of `P` and `M` depends on the value of `q` from the previous iteration, but since they are not part of the loop head, we do not need to adjust them.

The string `e` remains unchanged, and `s` also remains unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

At the end of the previous iteration, `q` was the current character in the string `e`. For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must be the next character in the string `e`.

State: **`P` is 1 and `M` is 0 if `q` equals '+'. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 1. `i` is incremented by 1, `s` remains an input integer, and `e` is a string that must have at least 1 character. `q` is the next character in the string `e`.**
