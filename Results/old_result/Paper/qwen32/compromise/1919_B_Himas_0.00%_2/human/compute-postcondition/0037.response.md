The code `P += 1` increments the value of `P` by 1. Given the initial state, `P` is 2 if `q` equals '+', otherwise `P` is 0. After the increment, if `q` was '+', `P` becomes 3; if `q` was not '+', `P` becomes 1. The values of `M`, `i`, `s`, `e`, and `q` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`P` is 3 if `q` equals '+', otherwise `P` is 1; `M` is 0 if `q` equals '+', otherwise `M` is 2; `i` is incremented by 1; `s` remains an input integer; `e` is a string that must have at least 2 characters; `q` is the next character in the string `e`.**
