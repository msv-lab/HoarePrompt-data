Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The program simply calculates the difference between the count of '+' and '-' in the string and prints this difference, which is not related to the penalty calculation described.

The correct approach involves splitting the array into subarrays such that the sum of penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

Here is an example to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

**Example Input:**
```
1
4
++--
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```
Explanation: The optimal split is `([+],[+],[-],[-])` or `([+],[+,-,-])` or `([+,-],[-,-])` or `([+,-,-],[+])`, and in all these cases, the penalty is 0.

**Program Output:**
```
0
```
While this specific example might coincidentally produce the correct output, let's consider another example:

**Example Input:**
```
1
4
+-+-++
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```
Explanation: The optimal split is `([+,-],[+,-],[+],[+])`, which gives penalties of 2, 2, 1, and 1 respectively, summing to 4. However, the optimal split is actually `([+,-],[+,-,+,-])` which gives penalties of 2 and 4, summing to 2.

**Program Output:**
```
2
```
This example might also produce the correct output, but let's consider a more complex case:

**Example Input:**
```
1
6
+-+-+-++
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```
Explanation: The optimal split is `([+,-],[+,-],[+,-],[+])` which gives penalties of 2, 2, 2, and 1 respectively, summing to 7. However, the optimal split is actually `([+,-],[+,-],[+,-,+,-])` which gives penalties of 2 and 4, summing to 2.

**Program Output:**
```
2
```
While the program might produce the correct output for some specific cases, it does not follow the correct logic to minimize the penalty for all possible inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Conclusion:**
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum possible penalty for all potential cases. Thus, the correctness is False.
