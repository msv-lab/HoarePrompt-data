The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This means that `t` will now hold the specific integer value provided by the input, which is within the range of 1 to 100. The initial state mentioned that `t` was an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and this condition is still valid after the code execution. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.**
