To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the problem and the provided solution.

The key observation is that each move either adds or removes exactly one cube from the tower. Therefore, after `n` moves, the number of cubes `m` in the tower can be any integer from `0` to `n` (inclusive) if `n` is even, or from `1` to `n` (inclusive) if `n` is odd. This is because:

- If `n` is even, the difference between the initial number of cubes (which is 0) and the final number of cubes (`m`) must be even, because we are adding or removing cubes in pairs (two moves to add one cube and then remove it, or vice versa).
- If `n` is odd, the difference must be odd for the same reason.

Let's break down the conditions in the provided program:

1. `if n == m: print('Yes')` - This is correct because if `n` equals `m`, it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves (just add one cube `m` times).
2. `elif m > n: print('No')` - This is correct because you can't have more cubes than the number of moves, as each move can only add or remove one cube.
3. `elif m == n - 1: print('Yes')` - This is correct because if `n` is odd, you can have `n-1` cubes by adding `n-1` cubes and removing one.
4. `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0: print('Yes')` - This is correct because if both `m` and `n` are even, the difference is even, which is possible.
5. `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0: print('Yes')` - This is correct because if both `m` and `n` are odd, the difference is even, which is possible.
6. `else: print('No')` - This handles the remaining cases where the above conditions do not apply, which should result in "No".

However, the condition `elif m == n - 1: print('Yes')` is redundant because it is already covered by the conditions `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:` and `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:`. The program still works correctly without this line, but it doesn't cause any incorrect behavior.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
