The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `data`. This operation affects the variable `data` and does not change the values of `t`, `times`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, or `check`.

Since `n` is the number of integers that will be read from the input, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are the integers themselves, the list `data` will contain exactly these `n` integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `times` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `data` is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `check` is 2147483647.**
