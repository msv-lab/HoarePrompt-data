You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.
