Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by `nodes`, which is a defaultdict(list) containing adjacency lists for each node, and the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t representing the starting nodes where the stone is initially put, with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `ends` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for key in nodes:
    if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
        ends.append(key)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
