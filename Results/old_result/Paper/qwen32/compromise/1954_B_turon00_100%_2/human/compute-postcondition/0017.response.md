The code snippet provided sets `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `ans`, or `i`. The only change is the value of `cnt`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is `a[0]`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is 1, else `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 0.**
