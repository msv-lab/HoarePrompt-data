The code snippet provided resets the value of `cnt` to 0. None of the other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change while keeping other variables in their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the new input list of integers, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, and the element `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`.**
