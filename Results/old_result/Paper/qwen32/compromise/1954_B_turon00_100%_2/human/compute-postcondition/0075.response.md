The code snippet `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Therefore, the value of `cnt` will be 2 if it was initially 1, which is consistent with the initial state description that `cnt` is 1 if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the new input list of integers, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is 2 if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `n` if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `ans` is 0, and `i` is 1.**
