Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines the minimum length of contiguous sequences of equal elements in the list `a`. If the list consists of a single element or if the entire list is a single contiguous sequence, it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs the minimum length of such sequences.**
