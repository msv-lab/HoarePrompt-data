The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than `i_new + 1` and `i` is `i_new + 1` still holds true. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than `i_new + 1`, `i` is `i_new + 1`, `cnt` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i_new + 1`, `i` is `i_new + 1`, `cnt` is incremented by 1**.
