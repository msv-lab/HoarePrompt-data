The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. Given the initial state, `ans` is initially `n` and `cnt` is `0`. Since `cnt` is `0` and `n` is greater than `0`, `ans` will be updated to `0`.

Output State: **`t` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the new input list of integers, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, and the element `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`.**
