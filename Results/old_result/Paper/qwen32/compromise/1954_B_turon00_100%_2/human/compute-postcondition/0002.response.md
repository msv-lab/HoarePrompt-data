The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is an integer input where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. The variable `a` remains as described in the initial state for each test case and is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` remains as described in the initial state for each test case.**
