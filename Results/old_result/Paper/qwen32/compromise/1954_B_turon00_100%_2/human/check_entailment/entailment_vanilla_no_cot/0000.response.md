Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. The logic in the program is flawed because it only considers contiguous segments of the same element and does not correctly account for the possibility of making the array non-beautiful by removing elements in a way that disrupts the "beautiful" property as defined.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the structure of the array and how the "beautiful" property can be disrupted. Specifically, we need to look for the longest contiguous segment of the same element and determine if removing elements from this segment can make the array non-beautiful. The provided program does not handle this correctly and can produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        # If the array has only one element, it is already beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful
        if n == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Find the longest contiguous segment of the same element
        max_len = 1
        current_len = 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i] == a[i - 1]:
                current_len += 1
            else:
                max_len = max(max_len, current_len)
                current_len = 1
        max_len = max(max_len, current_len)
        
        # If the entire array is the same, we need to remove all but one element
        if max_len == n:
            print(n - 1)
        else:
            # Otherwise, we need to remove at least one element from the longest segment
            print(1)

# Call the function to process input
func()
```

This corrected program correctly identifies the longest contiguous segment of the same element and determines the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, or outputs -1 if the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.
