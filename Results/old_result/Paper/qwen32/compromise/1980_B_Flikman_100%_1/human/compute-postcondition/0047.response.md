Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variable `t`**: It is mentioned as `t - 1`, but there's no initial value provided for `t`. However, this doesn't affect the print statement directly.
2. **Variables `n`, `f`, `k`**: These are integers read from the input.
   - `n` is the first integer.
   - `f` is the second integer.
   - `k` is the third integer.
3. **List `a`**: This is a list of integers read from the input.
4. **Variable `favorite_value`**: This is the value at index `f - 1` in the list `a`.
5. **List `sorted_a`**: This is the list `a` sorted in descending order.
6. **Variable `removed_count`**: This is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`.
7. **Variable `favorite_count`**: This is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the entire `sorted_a` list.
8. **Condition**: It is given that `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`.

### Print Statement:

The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. The conditions and variables described in the initial state do not influence what is printed by this statement. The output is constant and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, `favorite_value`, `sorted_a`, `removed_count`, or `favorite_count`.

### Final Output:

Output: **YES**
