The given code snippet initializes a variable `removed_count` to 0. No other variables are modified or assigned new values in this snippet. Therefore, the state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n`, `f`, `k` are the three integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`; `sorted_a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the list `a`; `removed_count` is 0.**
