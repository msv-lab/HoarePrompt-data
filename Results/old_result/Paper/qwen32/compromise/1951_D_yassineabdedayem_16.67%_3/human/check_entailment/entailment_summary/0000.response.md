### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by setting up stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. The core idea of the program is to iteratively determine the number of jewels Alice can buy at each stall and the price per jewel, ensuring that she buys exactly `k` jewels by the end.

However, there are several issues with the current implementation:

1. **Logic for Determining Prices**: The logic for determining the prices `Min` and `Max` and how they are used to reduce `n` and `k` is flawed. The program does not correctly ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Specifically, the conditions and the way `Min` and `Max` are calculated and used do not align with the problem's requirements.

2. **Termination Conditions**: The program uses conditions like `n != 0 and k > 0 and (rep < 60) and (n >= k)` to control the loop. However, these conditions do not guarantee that `k` will be reduced to zero or that the number of stalls will not exceed 60.

3. **Output Format**: The program outputs the prices in a single line separated by spaces, which is correct, but the logic to determine these prices is incorrect.

4. **Example Cases**: The provided example cases in the problem statement are not correctly handled by the program. For instance, the third test case with `n = 255` and `k = 8` should output "YES" with a valid sequence of prices, but the current implementation does not achieve this.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified above, the current implementation of the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**

To fix the program, a different approach is needed. One possible solution involves using a binary representation of `k` to determine the prices, ensuring that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting up at most 60 stalls with appropriate prices.
