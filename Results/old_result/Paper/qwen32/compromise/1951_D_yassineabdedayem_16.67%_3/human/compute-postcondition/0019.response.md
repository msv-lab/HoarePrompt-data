The code snippet updates the values of `Min` and `Max` based on the expressions `min(n // k, k)` and `max(int(n / k), k)`, respectively. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`) remain unchanged.

Given that `Min` and `Max` are recalculated, the new values are:
- `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`.
- `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is a non-zero integer such that `n >= k`; `k` is a positive integer such that `k - Min` <= n; `rep` is 1; `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.**
