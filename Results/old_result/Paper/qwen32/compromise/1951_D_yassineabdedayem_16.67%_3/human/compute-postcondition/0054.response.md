Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input; if `k` is 0, then `rep` is 2 and `tab` is `["1", "2"]`; otherwise, `rep` is 0 and `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `number` for each iteration.**

Explanation: The value of `rep` has been set to 0 by the code snippet. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `tab` remain as per their initial state descriptions.
