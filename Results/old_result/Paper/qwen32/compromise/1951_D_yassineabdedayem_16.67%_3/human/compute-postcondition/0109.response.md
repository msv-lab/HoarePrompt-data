The code calculates `Min` and `Max` based on the values of `n` and `k`. Specifically, `Min` is the minimum of the integer division of `n` by `k` and `k`, while `Max` is the maximum of the integer division of `n` by `k` (converted to an integer) and `k`. 

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, and `number` remain unchanged. The new variables `Min` and `Max` are introduced and calculated as described.

Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is `0`, `tab` is `[]`, `number` is `0`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**.
