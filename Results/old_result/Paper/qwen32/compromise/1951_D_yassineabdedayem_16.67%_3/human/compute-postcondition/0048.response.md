To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the given information and the loop behavior.

The loop iterates over a list `tab` and prints each element followed by a space. The loop's behavior is dependent on the length of `tab`, which is populated with string representations of numbers.

From the provided output states:
- After the first iteration, `tab` is `["1"]`.
- After the second iteration, `tab` is `["1", "2"]`.
- After the third iteration, `tab` is `["1", "2"]`, indicating that no new elements were added to `tab` after the second iteration.

Given that `tab` does not change after the second iteration, it means the loop will only execute up to 2 times. This is consistent with the initial state where `k` is 0, and `n` is 0 or a value less than `k`, which implies `n` must be 0.

Thus, the total number of iterations `rep` will be 2, and `tab` will remain `["1", "2"]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is 0 or a value less than `k`, `k` is 0, `rep` is 2, `tab` is `["1", "2"]`**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the state will be such that `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is 0 (since it must be less than `k` which is 0), `k` remains 0, the total number of iterations `rep` is 2, and the list `tab` contains the strings `["1", "2"]`.
