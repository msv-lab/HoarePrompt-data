Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Variables and their initial states**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is 0 or a value less than `k`.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `rep` is the total number of iterations executed by the loop (up to 60).
   - `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `number` for each iteration.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Since `k` is 0, the condition `n < k` is always `False` (because `n` is either 0 or less than 0).
   - Given that `n` cannot be less than `k` (which is 0), the loop that would populate `tab` never executes.
   - Therefore, `tab` remains an empty list throughout the execution.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(len(tab))`.
   - Since `tab` is an empty list, `len(tab)` evaluates to 0.

Given this analysis, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **0**
