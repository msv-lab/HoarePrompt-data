Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer; `rep` is 0; `number` is 0; `tab` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
    Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
    if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
        number = Min
        k = k - Max
    else:
        number = Max
        k = k - Min
    tab.append(str(number))
    n -= Min * Max
    rep += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is a non-zero integer such that `n = n - Min * Max`; `k` is a positive integer such that `k - Min` <= n; `rep` is 1; `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`; `Min` is min(n // k, k); `Max` is max(int(n / k), k). If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is 0 and `number` is `Min`. Otherwise, `number` is `Max`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is a non-zero integer such that `n >= k` and `n` is now `n - Min * Max`; `k` is a positive integer such that `k - Min` <= n and `k` has been updated based on the initial conditions; `rep` is 2; `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and now also contains the string representation of `number` appended to it; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is a non-zero integer such that `n - Min * Max` > 0 and `n - Min * Max` >= `k`; `k` is updated based on the condition: if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is set to `k - max(int(n / k), k)`, otherwise `k` is set to `k - Min`; `rep` is 3; `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` three times; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`; `number` is set to `Min` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is set to `Max`. `n` is now `n - Min * Max`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
