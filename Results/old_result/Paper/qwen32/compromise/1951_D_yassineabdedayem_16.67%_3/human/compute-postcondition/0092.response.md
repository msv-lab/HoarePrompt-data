Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is described as `t-1`, but this doesn't affect our current task since `t` is not used in the print statement.
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is 0, and then it is mentioned again that `k` equals 0, which is redundant but confirms its value.
- `rep` is 3.
- `tab` is a list containing the strings '3', '2', and '1'.
- `number` is 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(len(tab))
```

### Analysis:
- The `len()` function in Python returns the number of items in an object.
- In this case, `tab` is a list with three elements: '3', '2', and '1'.
- Therefore, `len(tab)` will return the number of elements in the list `tab`, which is 3.

### Output:
Output: **3**
