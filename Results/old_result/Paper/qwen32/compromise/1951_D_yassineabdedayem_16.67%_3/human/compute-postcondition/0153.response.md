Postcondition: **`t` is t, `n` is 0 or less than `k`, `k` is either 0 or less than 0, `rep` is the number of iterations (less than 60), `tab` is a list of string representations of the numbers calculated, and `number` is the last number calculated. If `k` is 0, then `k` remains 0. If `k` is less than 0, then `k` remains less than 0.**
