Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer.**

Explanation: The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. The variables `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the first and second integers read from the input, respectively.
