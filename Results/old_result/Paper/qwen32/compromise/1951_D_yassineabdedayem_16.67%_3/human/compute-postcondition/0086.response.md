The code appends the string representation of the variable `number` to the list `tab`. Given the initial state, `number` can be either `1` or `n` based on the conditions provided. The other variables remain unchanged.

If `number` is `1`, then `tab` will be `['1', '1', '1']` or `['3', '2', '1']`.
If `number` is `n`, then `tab` will be `['1', '1', 'n']` or `['3', '2', 'n']`.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `rep` is 2, `tab` is either `['1', '1', '1']` or `['3', '2', '1']` or `['1', '1', 'n']` or `['3', '2', 'n']`, `Min` is 1, `Max` is `n`. If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is `1 - n` and `number` is 1. Otherwise, `k` is 0 and `number` is `n`.**
