Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is `k - 2 * Min`, `rep` is `1`, `tab` is `['number']`, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decreased by `Min`, which means `k` becomes `k - Min`. Since `Min` is also used in the calculation of `k` in the initial state, the new value of `k` is effectively `k - 2 * Min`. Other variables remain unchanged.
