The code snippet provided increments the variable `rep` by 1. None of the other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `tab`, `number`, `Min`, and `Max` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is either `0` or `k - min(n // k, k)`, `rep` is `1`, `tab` is `['number']`, `number` is either `1` or `max(int(n / k), k)`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is `0` and `number` is `1`. Otherwise, `k` is `k - min(n // k, k)` and `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**.
