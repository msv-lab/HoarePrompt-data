The code snippet provided resets the `tab` variable to an empty list. This change affects the `tab` variable, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input; if `k` is 0, then `rep` is 2; otherwise, `rep` is 0; `tab` is `[]`; `number` is 0.**

In simple terms, the `tab` list is now empty, while the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, and `number` remain as they were initially described.
