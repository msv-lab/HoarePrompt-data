The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides various variable descriptions, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string provided in the `print` function.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is straightforward: `print('YES')`.
2. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided and does not depend on any variables or conditions.
3. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, `number`), but none of these are referenced in the `print` statement.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
