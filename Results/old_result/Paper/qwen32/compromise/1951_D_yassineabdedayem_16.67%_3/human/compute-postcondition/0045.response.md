To determine what will be printed by the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and identify the value of the variable `i`.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` is 0 or a value less than `k`.
- `k` is 0.
- `rep` is the total number of iterations executed by the loop (up to 60).
- `tab` is `["1", "2"]`.

The variable `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, since the `print(i, end=' ')` statement is within a loop context (implied by the mention of `rep` as the number of iterations), we can infer that `i` is likely a loop counter.

Given that `rep` is the total number of iterations, we can deduce that `i` will take on values from 0 up to `rep - 1`. However, the exact value of `i` at the point of execution of the `print` statement is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we need to consider the possible range of values `i` could take.

Since the problem does not provide the exact loop structure or the current iteration, we can describe the output in terms of the loop counter `i`.

Output: **i (where i is the loop counter taking values from 0 to rep-1, and rep is the total number of iterations executed by the loop, up to 60)**
