The code snippet `k = k - Min` modifies the value of `k` by subtracting `Min` from it. Given the initial state, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`. After the execution of the code, the value of `k` will be updated to `k - Min`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is a non-zero integer such that `n >= k`; `k` is a positive integer such that `k - Min` <= n; `rep` is 1; `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`; `number` is `Max`; `k` is updated to `k - Min`.**
