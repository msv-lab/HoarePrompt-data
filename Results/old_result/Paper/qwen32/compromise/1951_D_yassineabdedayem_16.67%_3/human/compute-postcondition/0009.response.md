The value of `number` is assigned the value of `Min`. Since `Min` is defined as `min(n // k, k)`, `number` will now hold the value of `Min`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is a non-zero integer; `k` is a positive integer such that k <= n; `rep` is 0; `number` is `Min`; `tab` is an empty list; `Min` is min(n // k, k); `Max` is max(int(n / k), k); `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`.**
