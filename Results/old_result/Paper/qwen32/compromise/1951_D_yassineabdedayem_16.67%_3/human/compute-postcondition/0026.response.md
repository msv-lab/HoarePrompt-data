The code snippet `n -= Min * Max` updates the value of `n` by subtracting the product of `Min` and `Max` from it. The values of `Min` and `Max` remain unchanged, and the other variables such as `t`, `k`, `rep`, and `tab` are not affected by this operation.

The output state is calculated as follows:
- `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.
- `Min` and `Max` retain their initial values.
- `t`, `k`, `rep`, and `tab` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is a non-zero integer such that `n >= k` and `n` is now `n - Min * Max`; `k` is a positive integer such that `k - Min` <= n and `k` has been updated based on the initial conditions; `rep` is 1; `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and now also contains the string representation of `number` appended to it; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.**
