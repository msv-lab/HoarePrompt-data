Precondition: **nums is a list of lists where each inner list contains n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5) representing the amounts of water in the containers for each test case. The sum of the integers in each inner list is divisible by n. The length of nums (t) is between 1 and 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. Each integer a_i in the inner lists satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
