Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the condition for making all containers have the same amount of water. Specifically, the check `if curr < 0` is incorrect. This check is intended to determine whether it's possible to redistribute the water such that no container ever has less water than its target amount during the redistribution process. However, the current implementation incorrectly returns 'NO' if at any point the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the target mean becomes negative, which is not necessarily a valid condition to determine the impossibility of redistribution.

Here is a counterexample where the program returns 'NO' incorrectly:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- The total amount of water is 6, and the mean is 2.
- We can redistribute the water as follows:
  - Pour 1 unit from the third container to the first container: [2, 2, 2].

However, the provided program will return 'NO' for this input because the cumulative difference `curr` will become -1 at some point during the iteration, leading to an incorrect conclusion.

To fix the program, the logic should be adjusted to ensure that the water can be redistributed without violating the constraints given in the problem description. The current implementation does not correctly handle the redistribution logic, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios.
