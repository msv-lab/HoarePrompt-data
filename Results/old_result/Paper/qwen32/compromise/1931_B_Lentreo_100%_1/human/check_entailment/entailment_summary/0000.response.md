Reasoning:
The provided program is designed to determine if it is possible to redistribute water in the containers such that all containers have the same amount of water. The logic of the program is based on the idea that if the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the mean amount of water (which is the target amount for each container) never goes negative, then the redistribution is possible. This is because if at any point the cumulative difference goes negative, it would mean that some containers have less water than the mean and cannot be made to have the mean amount of water by pouring water from subsequent containers (since the operation only allows pouring from an earlier container to a later one).

Let's break down the logic:
1. The program calculates the total amount of water and then the mean amount of water per container.
2. It iterates through the containers, calculating the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the mean amount.
3. If at any point this cumulative difference goes negative, it returns 'NO', indicating that redistribution is not possible.
4. If the loop completes without the cumulative difference going negative, it returns 'YES', indicating that redistribution is possible.

The program is correct because:
- It correctly calculates the mean amount of water.
- It correctly checks if the cumulative difference ever goes negative, which is a valid condition for determining the possibility of redistribution under the given constraints.

The execution summary provided does not indicate any issues with the program's logic or implementation, and the example inputs and outputs match the expected behavior of the program.

Correctness: **True**
