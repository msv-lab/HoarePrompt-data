The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on these variables.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 before the loop starts. The state of `nums`, `total`, `mean`, and `curr` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Given that `n` is the length of `nums`, the condition for the loop to execute is that `n` must be greater than 0. The state of `i` should be 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`nums` is a list of lists where each inner list contains `n` integers (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
