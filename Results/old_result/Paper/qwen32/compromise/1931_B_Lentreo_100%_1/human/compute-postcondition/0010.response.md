Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the amounts of water in the containers for each test case. The function checks if it is possible to redistribute the water in such a way that each container in a test case has the same amount of water. If it is not possible, the function returns 'NO'. If it is possible, the function returns 'YES'.**
