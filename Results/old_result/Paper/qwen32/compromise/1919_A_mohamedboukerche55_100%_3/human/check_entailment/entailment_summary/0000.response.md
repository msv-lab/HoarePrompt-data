### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the initial number of coins each player has. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins.

Let's break down the game mechanics:
1. **Swap or Not Swap**: Each player can choose to swap wallets or not before removing a coin.
2. **Remove a Coin**: After potentially swapping, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
3. **Winning Condition**: The player who is unable to make a valid move (i.e., when both wallets are empty) loses.

When both players play optimally:
- If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is **even**, the second player (Bob) will always win.
- If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is **odd**, the first player (Alice) will always win.

This is because:
- With an even number of coins, the game can always be mirrored by the second player, ensuring they always have a move until the end.
- With an odd number of coins, the first player can force the game into a state where the second player is left with an even number of coins, ensuring the first player's victory.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of `a + b` and printing 'Bob' if it's even and 'Alice' if it's odd.
