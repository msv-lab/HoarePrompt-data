In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range defined by the variable `t`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes are `i` and `t`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `i`**: This is the loop variable that takes values from 0 to `t-1`. Before the loop starts, `i` is not explicitly defined, but it will be initialized to 0 by the `range(t)` function. So, no adjustment is needed for `i`.

2. **Variable `t`**: This variable determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be at least 1. Given the condition `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, this condition is already satisfied by the problem statement.

Since the loop variable `i` is automatically initialized by the `range(t)` function and `t` is already within the valid range, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state remains as it is, with the only requirement being that `t` is within the specified range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000**
