Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is either 0, -2, or -4, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, which may or may not have consecutive duplicates, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end, `ans1` is updated to include `b[i]` if `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans1` remains unchanged, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to the original value of `k`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, `l` is a list that now includes `b[i]` appended to it. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
