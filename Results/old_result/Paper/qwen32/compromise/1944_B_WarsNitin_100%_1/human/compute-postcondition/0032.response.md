Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `k` is either 0 or remains unchanged; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a` with no consecutive duplicates (`b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`); `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end; `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the elements `[b[n - 1], b[n - 1]]`; `ans2` is an empty list; `req` is equal to `k`. Additionally, the current element `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`.**
