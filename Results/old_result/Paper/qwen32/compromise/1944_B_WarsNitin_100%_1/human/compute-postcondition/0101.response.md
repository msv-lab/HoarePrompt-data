Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `ans1` contains all elements of `l`.
- `ans2` contains all elements of `l`.
- `k` is updated to `k - len(l)`.
- `i` is set to `len(l) - 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*ans1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `*` operator in the `print` function unpacks the list `ans1` and prints its elements separated by spaces.
- Since `ans1` contains all elements of `l`, printing `*ans1` will result in printing all elements of `l` separated by spaces.

### Conclusion:
The `print(*ans1)` statement will print all elements of the list `l` separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Output: **all elements of l separated by spaces (where l is the list containing the elements)**
