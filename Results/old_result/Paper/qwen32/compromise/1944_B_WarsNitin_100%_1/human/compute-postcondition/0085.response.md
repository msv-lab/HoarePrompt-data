The code appends the element at index `i` of list `l` to the list `ans1`. The values of `l` and `k` remain unchanged unless `k` is equal to 0, in which case the loop or if statement is broken. Since the task does not specify the current state of `ans1`, we assume it is a list that may or may not contain elements.

Given that `l` is a non-empty list, `l[i]` refers to a specific element within `l`. After executing the code, `ans1` will have this element appended to it.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `k` is unchanged, `ans1` now contains the additional element `l[i]`.**
