Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` and `k` (now twice its original value) are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end; `ans1` is an empty list; `ans2` is an empty list; `req` is equal to `k`. If `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, then `l` is a list containing the single element `b[0]`. Otherwise, `l` remains an empty list. Additionally, `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`.**
