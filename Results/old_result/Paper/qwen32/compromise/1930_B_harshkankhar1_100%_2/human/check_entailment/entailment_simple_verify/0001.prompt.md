You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) which is the length of the permutation p. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: elements of the list `a` after reversing elements at even indices and keeping elements at odd indices unchanged



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

The program is designed to generate a permutation of length `n` such that there do not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.

Here's the program logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
3. It creates a list `a` containing the numbers from 1 to `n`.
4. It reverses the elements at even indices of the list `a`.
5. It prints the modified list `a`.

Let's consider the transformation applied to the list `a`:
- If `n` is even, the list `a` is split into two halves: the first half and the second half. The first half is reversed and placed back into the even indices, while the second half remains in the odd indices.
- If `n` is odd, the same process is applied, but the middle element remains in its original position.

Let's check if this transformation results in a permutation that satisfies the problem's condition.

### Example Analysis

#### Example 1: n = 4
- Original list: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
- After transformation: `[4, 2, 1, 3]`
- Check the condition:
  - `4` does not divide any other element in the list.
  - `2` does not divide `1` or `3`.
  - `1` does not divide `2` or `3`.
  - `3` does not divide any other element in the list.
- The condition is satisfied.

#### Example 2: n = 3
- Original list: `[1, 2, 3]`
- After transformation: `[3, 2, 1]`
- Check the condition:
  - `3` does not divide `2` or `1`.
  - `2` does not divide `1`.
  - `1` does not divide any other element in the list.
- The condition is satisfied.

### General Case Analysis
The transformation applied to the list `a` ensures that no two elements at even indices and their subsequent elements at odd indices can satisfy the division condition. This is because the elements at even indices are reversed, which disrupts any potential division relationships that might have existed in the original list.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the given program correctly generates a permutation that satisfies the problem's condition for all valid inputs within the constraints.
