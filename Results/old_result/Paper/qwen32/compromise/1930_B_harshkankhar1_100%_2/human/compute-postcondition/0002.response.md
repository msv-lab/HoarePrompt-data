Let's break down the given initial state and the provided code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer where \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a list where elements at even indices are reversed, while elements at odd indices remain the same.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*a)
```

### Analysis:
1. **List `a` Structure**:
   - Elements at even indices are reversed.
   - Elements at odd indices remain in their original positions.

2. **Printing the List**:
   - The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

### Example:
Let's consider an example to illustrate the transformation and the output:
- Suppose `n = 6` and the initial list `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
- Elements at even indices (0, 2, 4) are `1, 3, 5`.
- Reversing these elements gives `5, 3, 1`.
- Elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5) remain the same: `2, 4, 6`.
- The transformed list `a` becomes `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6]`.
- The `print(*a)` statement will output: `5 2 3 4 1 6`.

### General Case:
For any list `a` of length `n`:
- Elements at even indices are reversed.
- Elements at odd indices remain unchanged.

### Output Description:
The `print(*a)` statement will print the elements of the list `a` after the transformation, where elements at even indices have been reversed and elements at odd indices remain the same.

### Final Output:
Output: **elements of the list `a` after reversing elements at even indices and keeping elements at odd indices unchanged**.
