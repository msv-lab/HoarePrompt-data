The code snippet creates a list `a` that contains integers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is the integer input from the user. This means that for each test case, `a` will be a list of the first `n` positive integers.

Given the initial state, the function receives an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it receives an integer `n` which is the length of the permutation `p`.

After executing the code snippet `a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))`, the list `a` is created for the current test case with values from 1 to `n`.

Output State: **The function still receives an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For the current test case, `n` is an integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and `a` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n`.**
