To determine the output state after the given loop has finished executing, we need to focus on the loop itself:

```python
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This loop iterates over each element in the `results` list and prints it. The loop does not modify the `results` list or any other variables outside of the loop. It only prints each element in the list.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the integer value from the last iteration.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are the strings from the last iteration.
- `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1` for each of the `t` iterations.

After the loop finishes, the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The `results` list is also unchanged. The only action performed by the loop is printing each element of `results`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value from the last iteration, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the strings from the last iteration, and `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1` for each of the `t` iterations.**
