To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to analyze the loop and the operations performed within it.

The loop iterates `t` times. During each iteration, the following actions are performed:
1. The value of `n` is reassigned to a new integer input.
2. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are reassigned to new strings of length `n` input by the user.
3. The function `func_1(n, a, b, c)` is called with the new values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, and its result is appended to the `results` list.

The initial state of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `results` is provided, but these are overwritten in the first iteration of the loop. Therefore, the final values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will be those from the last iteration of the loop. The `results` list will contain the results of `func_1` for each of the `t` iterations.

Since the problem does not specify the behavior of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact contents of the `results` list. However, we can describe the final state of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value from the last iteration, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the strings from the last iteration, and `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1` for each of the `t` iterations.**
