Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts three parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`, each being a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20. The function returns a value based on the comparison of these strings, but the specific return logic is not detailed here.**
