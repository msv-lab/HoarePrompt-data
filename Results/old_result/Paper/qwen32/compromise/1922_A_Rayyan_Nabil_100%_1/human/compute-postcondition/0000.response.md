The code snippet provided reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 20, inclusive, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. 

Since the code only affects the variable `t`, the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The variable `t` will now hold the integer value provided by the user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `t` is an input integer.**
