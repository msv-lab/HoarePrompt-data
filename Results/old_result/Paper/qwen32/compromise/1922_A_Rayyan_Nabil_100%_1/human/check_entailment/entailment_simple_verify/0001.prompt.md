You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

We need to determine if there exists a template string `t` such that:
1. Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
2. String `c` does not match the template `t`.

### Template Matching Conditions
- If the i-th letter of the template `t` is lowercase, then the i-th letter of the string `s` must be the same as the i-th letter of the template `t`.
- If the i-th letter of the template `t` is uppercase, then the i-th letter of the string `s` must be different from the lowercase version of the i-th letter of the template `t`.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(n, a, b, c)`: This function checks if there exists at least one position `i` where the i-th characters of `a` and `b` are different from the i-th character of `c`. If such a position exists, it returns 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
2. `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases, reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results.

### Correctness of the Solution

Let's consider the logic of `func_1`:
- The function iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- For each position `i`, it checks if `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`.
- If such a position exists, it means that we can choose the i-th character of the template `t` to be uppercase (since `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`), thus making `a` and `b` match `t` while `c` does not.
- If no such position exists, then it is impossible to find a template `t` that satisfies the conditions, and the function returns 'NO'.

### Conclusion

The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies whether there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match `t` while `c` does not. The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the results as required.

Therefore, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
