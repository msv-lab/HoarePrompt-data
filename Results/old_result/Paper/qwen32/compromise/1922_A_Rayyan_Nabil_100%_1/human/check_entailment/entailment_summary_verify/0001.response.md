### Reasoning:

Let's re-examine the problem description and the provided solution to ensure the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to determine if there exists a template string `t` such that:
1. Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
2. String `c` does not match the template `t`.

#### Template Matching Conditions Recap:
- If the i-th letter of the template `t` is lowercase, then the i-th letter of the string `s` must be the same as the i-th letter of the template `t`.
- If the i-th letter of the template `t` is uppercase, then the i-th letter of the string `s` must be different from the lowercase version of the i-th letter of the template `t`.

#### Solution Analysis Recap:
The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(n, a, b, c)`: This function iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1` and checks if `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`. If such a position exists, it returns 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
2. `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases, reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results.

#### Evaluation:
Let's consider the logic of `func_1`:
- For a position `i`, if `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`, it means that we can set the i-th character of the template `t` to be uppercase (since `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`). This ensures that `a` and `b` match `t` at position `i` (because they are different from `c[i]`), and `c` does not match `t` at position `i` (because `c[i]` is the same as itself but we require it to be different from the uppercase version of `t[i]`).
- If no such position exists, then it is impossible to find a template `t` that satisfies the conditions, and the function returns 'NO'.

The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies whether there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match `t` while `c` does not. The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the results as required.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly determines if there exists a template string `t` that satisfies the given conditions for each test case.

Final: **True**
