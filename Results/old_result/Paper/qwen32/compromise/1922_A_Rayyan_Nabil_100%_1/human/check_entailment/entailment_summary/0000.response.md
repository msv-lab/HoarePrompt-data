### Reasoning:

The provided Python program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. Here's a detailed breakdown of how these functions work and whether they correctly solve the problem as described:

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: To determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it while string `c` does not.
- **Logic**: The function iterates through each character position `i` of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. It checks if the characters at position `i` in `a` and `b` are different from the character at position `i` in `c`. If such a position is found, it returns 'YES'. If no such position exists, it returns 'NO'.
- **Correctness Analysis**: This logic is flawed. The function checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, but it does not ensure that `a[i]` and `b[i]` match the same template character at position `i`. Specifically, it does not account for the requirement that if `t[i]` is lowercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be the same as `t[i]`, and if `t[i]` is uppercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`. The function only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, which is insufficient to determine if a valid template exists.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: To handle multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
- **Logic**: The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case using `func_1`. It then prints the results for each test case.
- **Correctness Analysis**: The logic of reading input and processing each test case is correct. However, since `func_1` is incorrect, the overall correctness of the program is compromised.

### Conclusion:
Given the incorrect logic in `func_1`, the program as a whole does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
