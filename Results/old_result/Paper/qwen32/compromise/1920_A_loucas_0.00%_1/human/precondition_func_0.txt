Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of constraints. The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two integers a and x (a ∈ {1, 2, 3}, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). a denotes the type of constraint. If a=1, k must be greater than or equal to x. If a=2, k must be less than or equal to x. If a=3, k must be not equal to x. It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).
