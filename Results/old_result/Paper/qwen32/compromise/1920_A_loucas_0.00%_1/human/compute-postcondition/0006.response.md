`innerLoop` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `loop` must be greater than 0; `less` is an empty list; `big` is an empty list; `no` is an empty list; `num` is 0; `innerLoop` is an input integer.
Output State: **`loop` must be greater than 0; `less` is an empty list; `big` is an empty list; `no` is an empty list; `num` is 0; `innerLoop` is an input integer.**
