Postcondition: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `iterable` is `innerLoop + 2`, `num` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input. If `x` is equal to 1, `big` is a list containing the second integer from the input, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is equal to 2, `less` is a list containing the second integer from the input, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. Otherwise, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `big` and `less` are empty lists.**
