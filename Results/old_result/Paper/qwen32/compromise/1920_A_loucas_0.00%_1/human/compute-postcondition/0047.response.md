To determine what will be printed by the `print(num)` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the definition of `num`.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`loop`**: Greater than 0.
2. **`innerLoop`**: Equal to the number of iterations.
3. **`num`**: This variable is set to `first_valid_i` if `first_valid_i` is not in the list `no`. Otherwise, `num` remains 0.
4. **`iterable2`**: Equal to `innerLoop`.
5. **`big`**: Contains all `a` values where `x` was 1.
6. **`less`**: Contains all `a` values where `x` was 2.
7. **`no`**: Contains all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2.

### Determining the Value of `num`:
- The value of `num` is determined by the condition: `num` is set to `first_valid_i` if `first_valid_i` is not in the list `no`. Otherwise, `num` remains 0.
- The exact value of `first_valid_i` and the contents of the list `no` are not provided, so we can't determine the exact numerical value of `num`.
- However, we can describe the value of `num` based on the given conditions.

### Conclusion:
- If `first_valid_i` is not in the list `no`, then `num` will be `first_valid_i`.
- If `first_valid_i` is in the list `no`, then `num` will be 0.

### Output:
Output: **num (where num is first_valid_i if first_valid_i is not in the list no, otherwise num is 0)**
