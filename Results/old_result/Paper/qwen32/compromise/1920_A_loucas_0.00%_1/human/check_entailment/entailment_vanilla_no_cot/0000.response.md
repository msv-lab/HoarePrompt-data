Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for the following reasons:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Range**: The program calculates the range of valid `k` values by iterating from `max(big)` to `min(less)`. However, it does not correctly count the number of valid integers `k` within this range that do not match any values in the `no` list. Instead, it breaks the loop after finding the first valid `k` and prints it, which is not the expected behavior.

2. **Output Requirement**: The problem asks for the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints, not a specific valid integer `k`.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where the range `max(big)` to `min(less)` is invalid (i.e., `max(big) > min(less)`), which should result in an output of `0`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        big = []
        no = set()
        num = 0
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                big.append(x)
            elif a == 2:
                less.append(x)
            else:
                no.add(x)
        min_val = max(big)
        max_val = min(less)
        if min_val > max_val:
            print(0)
        else:
            count = 0
            for k in range(min_val, max_val + 1):
                if k not in no:
                    count += 1
            print(count)

func()
```

In this corrected version:
- The program correctly calculates the range of valid `k` values from `max(big)` to `min(less)`.
- It uses a set for `no` to efficiently check if a value is not allowed.
- It counts the number of valid integers `k` within the range that are not in the `no` set.
- It handles the case where the range is invalid by printing `0`.
