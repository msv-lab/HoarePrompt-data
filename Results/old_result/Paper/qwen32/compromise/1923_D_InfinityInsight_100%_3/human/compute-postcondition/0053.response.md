The code snippet `ans[i] = 1` updates the `i`-th element of the list `ans` to the value `1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is the length of `a` and is greater than 1, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`, `last` is unchanged, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is `1`, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is `last[i - 1]` if `inx < 0` is false, otherwise `inx` remains unchanged, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
