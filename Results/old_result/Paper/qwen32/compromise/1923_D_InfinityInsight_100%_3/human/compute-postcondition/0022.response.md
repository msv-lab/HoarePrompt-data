The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the elements of the list `a`. According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the list `a` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the last element of `a` that was processed.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the next element in the list `a`. Since the loop iterates over each element in `a` sequentially, the next `i` will be the next element in the list after the current `i`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes with at least one element.
- `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n >= 1`.
- `left` is a list containing the elements `[0, i, left[-1] + i]`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `-1`.
- `last` is a list where the first element is `-1` and each subsequent element is either the index `i` where `a[i]` is different from `a[i-1]` or the last index of a change if `a[i]` is the same as `a[i-1]`.

Since the loop iterates over each element in `a`, the variable `i` will take on the next value in the list `a`. If the previous `i` was the last element of `a`, then the loop will not execute again. Otherwise, `i` will be the next element in the list.

Given that the loop body is omitted, we do not have information about how `left`, `ans`, and `last` are modified within the loop. However, for the loop to execute one more time, we only need to adjust `i` to the next element in the list `a`.

Since we do not know the exact previous value of `i`, let's assume `i` was `a[j]` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `a[j+1]`.

State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes with at least one element, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n >= 1`; `left` is a list containing the elements `[0, i, left[-1] + i]`; `ans` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `-1`; `last` is a list where the first element is `-1` and each subsequent element is either the index `i` where `a[i]` is different from `a[i-1]` or the last index of a change if `a[i]` is the same as `a[i-1]`; `i` is the next element in the list `a` after the previous `i`.**

Since we need to specify a concrete state, let's assume `i` was the first element of `a` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the second element of `a`.

State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes with at least one element, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n >= 1`; `left` is a list containing the elements `[0, i, left[-1] + i]`; `ans` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `-1`; `last` is a list where the first element is `-1` and each subsequent element is either the index `i` where `a[i]` is different from `a[i-1]` or the last index of a change if `a[i]` is the same as `a[i-1]`; `i` is the second element in the list `a`.**
