The code snippet provided is:
```python
inx2 = last[i - 1]
```

This line of code updates the value of `inx2` to be equal to the value of `last[i - 1]`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes
- `n` is the length of `a` and is greater than 1
- `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`
- `last` is unchanged
- `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`
- `inx` is the value returned by `func_1(left, x)`
- `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`
- `i` is `i + 1`

The only change is in the value of `inx2`, which is now `last[i - 1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is the length of `a` and is greater than 1, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`, `last` is unchanged, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is the value returned by `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`.**
