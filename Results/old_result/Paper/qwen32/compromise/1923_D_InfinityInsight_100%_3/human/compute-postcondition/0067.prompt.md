You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, and n is an integer representing the number of slimes such that n == len(a) and n >= 1.
def func_2(a, n):
    left = [0]
    last = [-1]
    ans = [-1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] != a[i - 1]:
            last.append(i)
        else:
            last.append(last[-1])
        
    #State: `a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n >= 1`; `left` is a list containing the single element `0`; `ans` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `-1`; `last` is a list where the first element is `-1` and each subsequent element is either the index `i` where `a[i]` is different from `a[i-1]` or the last index of a change if `a[i]` is the same as `a[i-1]`.
    for i in a:
        left.append(left[-1] + i)
        
    #State: `a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is the length of `a`, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements all initialized to `-1`, and `last` is unchanged.
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
            ans[i] = 1
            continue
        
        x = left[i] - a[i] - 1
        
        inx = func_1(left, x)
        
        inx2 = last[i - 1]
        
        if inx2 < inx:
            inx = inx2
        
        if inx < 0:
            continue
        
        ans[i] = i + 1 - inx
        
    #State: `a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is the length of `a`, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`, `last` is unchanged, and `ans` is a list of `n` elements where each element is either `1` if `a[i] < a[i - 1]`, or `i + 1 - inx` where `inx` is determined by the conditions in the loop.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` of `n` elements where each element is either `1` if `a[i] < a[i - 1]`, or `i + 1 - inx` where `inx` is determined by the conditions in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `a` of integers representing the sizes of slimes and an integer `n` representing the number of slimes such that `n` equals the length of `a` and is at least 1. The function returns a list `ans` of `n` elements where each element is `1` if the size of the current slime is less than the size of the previous slime, or `i + 1 - inx` where `inx` is determined by conditions within the loop.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `ans` of `n` elements where each element is either `1` if `a[i] < a[i - 1]`, or `i + 1 - inx` where `inx` is determined by the conditions in the loop.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
