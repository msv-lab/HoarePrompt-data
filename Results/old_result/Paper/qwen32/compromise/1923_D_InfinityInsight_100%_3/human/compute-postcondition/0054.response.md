Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is the length of `a` and is greater than 1, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`, `last` is unchanged, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is `1`, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is `last[i - 1]` if `inx < 0` is false, otherwise `inx` remains unchanged, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`, and `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged, and the loop proceeds to the next iteration.
