The given code snippet updates the value of `ans[i]` based on the current index `i` and the variable `inx`. The other variables are not affected by this specific line of code.

Given the Initial State:
- `a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes.
- `n` is the length of `a` and is greater than 1.
- `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`.
- `last` is unchanged.
- `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is `1` if `a[i] < a[i - 1]`, otherwise the `i`-th element is `i + 1 - inx`.
- `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`.
- `inx` is `last[i - 1]` if `inx < 0` is false, otherwise `inx` remains unchanged.
- `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- If `inx2 < inx` is true, then `inx` is updated to `inx2`.

The line of code `ans[i] = i + 1 - inx` updates the `i`-th element of the `ans` list to `i + 1 - inx`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is the length of `a` and is greater than 1, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`, `last` is unchanged, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is `i + 1 - inx`, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is `last[i - 1]` if `inx < 0` is false, otherwise `inx` remains unchanged, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `inx2 < inx` is true, then `inx` is updated to `inx2`.**
