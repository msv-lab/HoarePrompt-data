The code snippet `last.append(last[-1])` appends the last element of the list `last` to itself. Initially, `last` contains a single element `[0]`. After executing the code, `last` will have two elements, both of which are `0`.

The other variables (`a`, `n`, `ans`, and `i`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n > 3`, `left` is a list containing the elements `[0, 0]`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `-1`, `i` is 3.**
