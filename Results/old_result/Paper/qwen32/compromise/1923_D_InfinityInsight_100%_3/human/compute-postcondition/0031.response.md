To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the line `inx = func_1(left, x)`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `inx`. However, we can state that `inx` will be assigned the value returned by `func_1(left, x)`.

The other variables (`a`, `n`, `left`, `last`, `ans`, and `x`) remain unchanged unless modified by `func_1`. Since we do not have details about `func_1`, we assume it does not modify these variables.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is the length of `a` and is greater than 1, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`, `last` is unchanged, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is `1` if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]` and all other elements are `-1`, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is the value returned by `func_1(left, x)`**.
