The code snippet `left.append(left[-1] + i)` appends a new element to the `left` list. The new element is the sum of the last element of `left` and the value of `i`.

Initial State: 
- `a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes with at least one element.
- `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n >= 1`.
- `left` is a list containing the elements `[0, i, left[-1] + i]`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `-1`.
- `last` is a list where the first element is `-1` and each subsequent element is either the index `i` where `a[i]` is different from `a[i-1]` or the last index of a change if `a[i]` is the same as `a[i-1]`.
- `i` is the second element in the list `a`.

Given that `left` initially contains `[0, i, left[-1] + i]`, the last element of `left` is `left[-1] + i`. Therefore, `left.append(left[-1] + i)` will append `(left[-1] + i) + i` to `left`, which simplifies to `left[-1] + 2*i`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes with at least one element; `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n >= 1`; `left` is a list containing the elements `[0, i, left[-1] + i, left[-1] + 2*i]`; `ans` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `-1`; `last` is a list where the first element is `-1` and each subsequent element is either the index `i` where `a[i]` is different from `a[i-1]` or the last index of a change if `a[i]` is the same as `a[i-1]`; `i` is the second element in the list `a`.**
