Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n >= 1`; `left` is a list containing the single element `0`; `last` is `[-1]`; `ans` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `-1`.**

In simpler terms, the variable `ans` has been initialized to a list of `-1` values, with the length of this list being equal to `n`. All other variables retain their initial values.
