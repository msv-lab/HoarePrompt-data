Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is the length of `a` and is greater than 1, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements all initialized to `-1`, and `last` is unchanged. The current element `a[i]` is less than the previous element `a[i - 1]`.**
