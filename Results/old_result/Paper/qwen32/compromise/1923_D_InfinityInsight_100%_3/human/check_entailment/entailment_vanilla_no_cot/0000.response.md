Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic and the approach used in the `func_2` function are not aligned with the problem requirements. Specifically, the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime.

Here are some key issues with the code:

1. **Logic for Slime Eating**: The program does not correctly simulate the process of slimes eating their neighbors. It incorrectly uses prefix sums and binary search to determine when a slime can eat another, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not correctly handle cases where a slime cannot eat any of its neighbors, leading to incorrect outputs for such cases.

3. **Complexity**: The approach used in the program is not optimal for the given constraints. For example, using binary search on prefix sums is not the correct way to simulate the eating process described in the problem.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to simulate the process of slimes eating their neighbors based on the given rules, possibly using a more suitable data structure or algorithm to efficiently track and update the slimes' sizes and positions.

Given these issues, the correctness of the program is **False**.
