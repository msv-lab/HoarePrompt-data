### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its annotations to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_2()`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3()`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with `x`, representing the starting player.

2. **Processing Each Throw:**
   - For each of the `m` throws, it reads `r` and `c` using `func_1().split()`.
   - It converts `r` to an integer.
   - It initializes a temporary set `temp` to store possible positions of the ball after the current throw.
   - For each player `q` in the current set `ans`:
     - If the throw is clockwise (`c == '0'`) or the direction is unknown (`c == '?'`), it calculates the new position as `(q + r) % n` and adds it to `temp`.
     - If the throw is counterclockwise (`c == '1'`) or the direction is unknown (`c == '?'`), it calculates the new position as `(q - r) % n` and adds it to `temp`.
   - It updates `ans` to be the set `temp`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If `0` is in `ans`, it removes `0` and adds `n` to handle the case where the position wraps around to the start of the circle.

4. **Output:**
   - It prints the number of players who could have the ball, which is the size of `ans`.
   - It prints the sorted list of these players.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Initialization:** The initial position `x` is correctly added to `ans`.
- **Throw Processing:** The logic for updating positions based on the throw direction and distance is correct. It considers both clockwise and counterclockwise movements when the direction is unknown.
- **Edge Case Handling:** The program correctly handles the case where the position wraps around the circle using modulo `n` operations.
- **Output:** The output format matches the problem's requirements.

### Annotations:
- The annotations describe the state of the program at key points, which align with the expected behavior of the program.
- The annotations confirm that the set `ans` is updated correctly for each throw and that the edge case handling for positions wrapping around is correctly implemented.

### Final Evaluation:
The annotations support the original assessment. The program correctly reads the input, processes each throw, handles edge cases, and produces the correct output format. There are no discrepancies between the annotations and the expected behavior of the program.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
