Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are greater than 0; `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`; `ans` is a set containing `x`, `r`, `c`, and at least one more element `q_next` that has not yet been taken; `r` is an integer; `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n` and possibly other values depending on the initial conditions of `c` and `q`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` contains `(q + r) % n`. `q` is `q_next`, the next value in `ans` that has not yet been taken.**
