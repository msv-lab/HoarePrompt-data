The code `ans.discard(0)` removes the element `0` from the set `ans` if it exists. Given the initial state, `0` is an element of `ans`, so it will be removed. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, `c`, `temp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are greater than 0; `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`. `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. `temp` is a set containing all elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` based on the value of `c`. `ans` is a set containing all elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` based on the value of `c`, excluding `0`. The loop has executed `m` times, and `ans` now contains all the values generated through the specified operations for each iteration, excluding `0`.**
