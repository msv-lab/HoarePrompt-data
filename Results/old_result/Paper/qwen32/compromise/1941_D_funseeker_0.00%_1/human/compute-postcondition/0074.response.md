The code snippet `ans.add(n)` adds the value of `n` to the set `ans`. Since `ans` already contains all the values generated through the specified operations for each iteration, excluding `0`, adding `n` to `ans` will simply include `n` in the set if it is not already present.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are greater than 0; `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`. `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. `temp` is a set containing all elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` based on the value of `c`. `ans` is a set containing all elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` based on the value of `c`, excluding `0`, and now includes `n`. The loop has executed `m` times, and `ans` now contains all the values generated through the specified operations for each iteration, excluding `0`, and includes `n`.**

In simple terms, `n` is added to the set `ans`, and all other variables retain their previous values and states.
