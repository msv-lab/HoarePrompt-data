The code snippet provided is:
```python
temp = set()
```
This line of code resets the variable `temp` to be an empty set. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m-2` are greater than 0; `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`. `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. `temp` is an empty set. `ans` is a set containing all values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` based on the value of `c`.**
