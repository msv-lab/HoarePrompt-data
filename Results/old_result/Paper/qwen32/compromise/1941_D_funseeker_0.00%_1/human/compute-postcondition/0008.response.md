The code snippet `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds a new element to the set `temp`. The new element is calculated as `(q + r) % n`, where `q`, `r`, and `n` are variables with specific values or conditions. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged, except for the addition of the new element to `temp`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are greater than 0, `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing `x`, `r`, and `c`, where `r` and `c` are the values returned by `func_1().split()` and `r` is now an integer, `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n`, and `c` is either '0' or '?'**.
