To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and how the variables are defined and manipulated.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`n` and `m`**:
   - `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0.

2. **`x`**:
   - `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`. Since `func_3()` is not defined in the initial state, we do not know the exact value of `x`.

3. **`r` and `c`**:
   - `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`.
   - `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`.
   - Since `func_1()` is not defined in the initial state, we do not know the exact values of `r` and `c`.

4. **`temp` and `ans`**:
   - `temp` is a set containing all elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` based on the value of `c`.
   - `ans` is a set containing all elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` based on the value of `c`.
   - If `0` is in `ans`, `0` is removed from `ans` and `n` is added to `ans`.
   - The loop has executed `m` times, and `ans` now contains all the values generated through the specified operations for each iteration.

### Analysis:
- The `ans` set is generated by performing operations based on the values of `r` and `c` for `m` iterations.
- Each iteration modifies `ans` by adding new elements calculated as `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`.
- If `0` is in `ans` after any modification, it is removed, and `n` is added to `ans`.

### Output:
The final output will be the elements of the `ans` set after `m` iterations of the described operations. Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `c` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values in `ans`. However, we can describe the output based on the given operations and conditions.

Output: **ans (where ans is the set of values generated after m iterations of the operations described, with 0 removed and n added if 0 was present in the set)**
