The code snippet adds a tuple to the set `temp`, where the tuple is calculated as `(q + r) % n`. The values of `n`, `q`, `r`, and `temp` are affected by this operation. The values of `m-1`, `x`, `c`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m-1` are greater than 0; `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`; `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()` and `c` is either '0' or '?'; `ans` is a set containing at least one element; `temp` is a set containing the element `(q + r) % n`.**
