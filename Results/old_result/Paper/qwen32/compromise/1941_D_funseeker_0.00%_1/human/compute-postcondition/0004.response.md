The provided code snippet converts the variable `r` from a string to an integer. Given the initial state, `r` is the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `m` and `n` are greater than 0, and `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`. The variable `ans` is a set containing `x`, `r`, and `c`, where `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`. 

After executing `r = int(r)`, the value of `r` is now an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` must be greater than 0, `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing `x`, `r`, and `c`, where `r` and `c` are the values returned by `func_1().split()`, and `r` is now an integer.**
