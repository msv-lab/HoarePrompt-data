The code snippet `r, c = func_1().split()` indicates that the function `func_1()` is called and its return value is a string that is then split into two parts. These two parts are assigned to the variables `r` and `c` respectively. Since `r` and `c` are assigned new values, their previous states are overwritten.

Given the initial state, `n` and `m-1` are still greater than 0, `x` is still the value returned by `func_3()`, and `ans` and `temp` sets are still defined based on the original `ans` set and the value of `c` (which is being reassigned).

Output State: **`n` and `m-1` are greater than 0; `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`; `r` is the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`; `ans` is a set containing all values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` based on the previous value of `c`; `temp` is a set containing all values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans` based on the previous value of `c`.**
