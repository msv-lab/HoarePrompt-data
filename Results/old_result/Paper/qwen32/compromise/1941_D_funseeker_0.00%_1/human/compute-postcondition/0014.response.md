The code adds a new element to the set `temp`. The new element is calculated as `(q + r) % n`.

Given:
- `n` and `m` are greater than 0.
- `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`.
- `ans` is a set containing `x`, `r`, and `c`, where `r` and `c` are the values returned by `func_1().split()` and `r` is now an integer.
- If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.
- `q` is the next value in `ans` that has not yet been taken.

The code modifies `temp` by adding `(q + r) % n` to it.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are greater than 0; `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`; `ans` is a set containing `x`, `r`, and `c`; `r` is an integer; `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n` and possibly `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?'; `q` is the next value in `ans` that has not yet been taken.**
