Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). The program only checks if the second last character in the second row is '<'. If it is, the program outputs 'No', otherwise it outputs 'Yes'. However, the problem requires a more complex analysis of the grid and the robot's movement rules.

The robot can move in four possible directions each second: left, right, up, or down. After moving, it must follow the arrow in the cell it lands on. The robot starts at (1, 1) and needs to reach (2, n). The program does not simulate the robot's movement or check the entire path the robot could take. It only makes a decision based on a single character in the second row, which is insufficient to determine if the robot can reach the target cell.

For example, in the third test case, the input is:
```
4
>>><
>><<
```
The program would check the second last character of the second row, which is '<', and output 'No'. However, the robot can actually reach the target cell (2, 4) by following the path: (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4).

Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
