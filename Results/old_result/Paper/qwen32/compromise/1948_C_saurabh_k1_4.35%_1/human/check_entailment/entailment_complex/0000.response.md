Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given rules and constraints. The program only checks the second last character of the second row of the grid and prints 'No' if it is '<', otherwise it prints 'Yes'. This logic does not account for the actual movement of the robot through the grid according to the arrows.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to simulate the robot's movements according to the rules provided:
1. The robot starts at (1, 1).
2. It can move left, right, down, or up, but it cannot move outside the grid.
3. After moving, it must follow the arrow in the cell it lands on.

The program should simulate these movements and check if the robot can reach (2, n) for each test case.

Given the provided logic, the program is incorrect because it does not simulate the robot's path through the grid and only makes a decision based on the second last character of the second row.

Correctness: **False**
