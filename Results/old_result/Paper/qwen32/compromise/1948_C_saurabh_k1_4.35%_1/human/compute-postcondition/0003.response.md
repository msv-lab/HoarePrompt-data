Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` composed of '<' and '>' characters. For each test case, it checks the second last character of the second string and prints 'No' if it is '<', otherwise it prints 'Yes'. The function does not modify the input values and outputs a series of 'Yes' or 'No' responses, one for each test case.**
