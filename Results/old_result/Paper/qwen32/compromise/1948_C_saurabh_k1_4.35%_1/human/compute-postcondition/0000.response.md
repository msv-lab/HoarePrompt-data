In the provided task, the loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `_`, but since `_` is a throwaway variable used just for iteration, its value does not need to be explicitly adjusted. Instead, the state that needs to be adjusted is related to the input that will determine how many times the loop will execute.

The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The loop will run `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Given this, the state needs to ensure that `t` is set to a value within the specified range so that the loop can execute the correct number of times. The values of `n`, the first row, and the second row of the grid do not need to be adjusted in the state before the loop starts because they are inputs that will be read during each iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `t` is set to a value within the specified range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
