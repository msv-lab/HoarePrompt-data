Reasoning:

The program is intended to determine the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells in the strip white. The logic provided in the function `func_1` attempts to find the first and last occurrence of 'B' in the string and calculates the segment length accordingly.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic in `func_1`:

1. It initializes `ma` and `mi` to 0.
2. It reads an integer `m` (which should be `n` as per the problem description) and the string `s`.
3. It then iterates over the string `s` to find the position of the first 'B' and assigns it to `mi`. This position is 1-based.
4. It then iterates over the reversed string `s` to find the position of the first 'B' (which is the last 'B' in the original string) and assigns it to `ma`. However, `ma` is calculated as `len(s) - d`, where `d` is the 1-based position of the first 'B' in the reversed string. This makes `ma` a 0-based index.
5. Finally, it returns `ma - mi + 2`.

However, the calculation of the segment length is incorrect. The segment length should be the distance between the first and last 'B' plus one, not `ma - mi + 2`. The current calculation can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the string "WBBWBW":
- The first 'B' is at position 2 (1-based).
- The last 'B' is at position 5 (1-based).
- The segment length should be `5 - 2 + 1 = 4`, but the function returns `4 - 2 + 2 = 4`, which is correct in this case, but this is not a general solution.

But consider the string "WBWBWWWBW":
- The first 'B' is at position 2 (1-based).
- The last 'B' is at position 9 (1-based).
- The segment length should be `9 - 2 + 1 = 8`, but the function returns `8 - 2 + 2 = 8`, which is correct in this case, but again, this is not a general solution.

The issue arises because the logic does not correctly generalize for all cases. The correct approach would be to find the first and last 'B' and return `last_B_index - first_B_index + 1`.

Thus, while the program happens to give correct answers for the provided examples, the logic is flawed and does not guarantee correctness for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
