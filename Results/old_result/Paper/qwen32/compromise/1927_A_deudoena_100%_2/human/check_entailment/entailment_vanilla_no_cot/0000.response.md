Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Let's analyze the logic of the program and see why it is incorrect:

The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to make all the cells white. The logic in the function seems to be trying to find the first and last occurrence of 'B' and then calculate the length of the segment between them plus two, which is incorrect.

Here's why:

1. The first loop finds the index of the first 'B' (from the left).
2. The second loop finds the index of the last 'B' (from the right).
3. It then calculates `ma - mi + 2` as the result, which doesn't necessarily give the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted to make all cells white.

The correct approach to solve this problem is to find the length of the longest continuous segment of 'B's. This segment is the minimum length that needs to be painted white to make all cells white.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_length = 0
    current_length = 0
    for j in s:
        if j == 'B':
            current_length += 1
            max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
        else:
            current_length = 0
    return max_length

n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())
```

This function correctly finds the longest segment of 'B's and returns its length, which is the minimum segment that needs to be painted white.
