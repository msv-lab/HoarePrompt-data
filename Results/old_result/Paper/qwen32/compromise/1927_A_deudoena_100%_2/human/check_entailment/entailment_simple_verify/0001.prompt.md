You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' in s.

    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
        
    #State: - `t` remains the same.
    #- `n` remains the same.
    #- `s` remains the same.
    #- `ma` is set to the position of the first 'B' from the start of the string when iterating from the end.
    #- `mi` remains the same.
    #- `m` remains the same.
    #- `c` remains the same.
    #- `d` is the position of the first 'B' from the end of the string.
    #- `l` remains the same.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `ma` will now hold the 0-based index of the first 'B' from the start of the string when counted from the end, and `d` will hold the 1-based index of this 'B' from the end of the string.
    #
    #Output State:
    return ma - mi + 2
    #The program returns ma - mi + 2, where ma is the 0-based index of the first 'B' from the start of the string when counted from the end, and mi is the given value of mi.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires finding the minimum length of a continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for all cells in the strip to become white. The key is to identify the first and last black cells in the strip, as the segment that needs to be painted white will span from the first black cell to the last black cell.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program starts by reading the number of test cases and then iterates through each test case. For each test case, it calls `func_1()` which is supposed to compute the minimum length of the segment to be painted white.

Here is the breakdown of `func_1()`:
1. It initializes `ma` and `mi` to 0. These variables are intended to store the indices of the last and first black cells, respectively.
2. It reads the length of the strip `m` and the string `s` representing the strip.
3. It iterates through the string `s` to find the first black cell and stores its index in `mi`.
4. It iterates through the reversed string `s[::-1]` to find the last black cell and stores its index in `ma`.
5. It calculates the minimum length of the segment to be painted white as `ma - mi + 2` and returns it.

### Issues with the Provided Program:
1. **Index Calculation**: The program calculates the index of the first black cell correctly (`mi`). However, the calculation for the last black cell is incorrect. When iterating through the reversed string, the index `d` is incremented from 1 to `m`, but the index of the last black cell in the original string should be `len(s) - d`, which is correct in the provided code. However, the final calculation `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect.
2. **Final Calculation**: The final calculation `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `ma - mi + 1` because the segment from the first black cell to the last black cell includes both endpoints.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified above, the program does not correctly compute the minimum length of the segment to be painted white.

### Correctness: **False**

### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = 0
    mi = -1
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
    c = 0
    ma = -1
    for j in s[::-1]:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - c
            break
    return ma - mi + 1

n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())
```

In this corrected version, the final calculation is `ma - mi + 1`, which correctly computes the length of the segment that needs to be painted white.
