Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires finding the minimum length of a continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for all cells in the strip to become white. The key is to identify the first and last black cells in the strip, as the segment that needs to be painted white will span from the first black cell to the last black cell.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program starts by reading the number of test cases and then iterates through each test case. For each test case, it calls `func_1()` which is supposed to compute the minimum length of the segment to be painted white.

Here is the breakdown of `func_1()`:
1. It initializes `ma` and `mi` to 0. These variables are intended to store the indices of the last and first black cells, respectively.
2. It reads the length of the strip `m` and the string `s` representing the strip.
3. It iterates through the string `s` to find the first black cell and stores its index in `mi`.
4. It iterates through the reversed string `s[::-1]` to find the last black cell and stores its index in `ma`.
5. It calculates the minimum length of the segment to be painted white as `ma - mi + 2` and returns it.

### Issues with the Provided Program:
1. **Index Calculation**: The program calculates the index of the first black cell correctly (`mi`). However, the calculation for the last black cell is incorrect. When iterating through the reversed string, the index `d` is incremented from 1 to `m`, but the index of the last black cell in the original string should be `len(s) - d`, which is correct in the provided code. However, the final calculation `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect.
2. **Final Calculation**: The final calculation `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `ma - mi + 1` because the segment from the first black cell to the last black cell includes both endpoints.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified above, the program does not correctly compute the minimum length of the segment to be painted white.

### Correctness: **False**

### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = 0
    mi = -1
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
    c = 0
    ma = -1
    for j in s[::-1]:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - c
            break
    return ma - mi + 1

n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())
```

In this corrected version, the final calculation is `ma - mi + 1`, which correctly computes the length of the segment that needs to be painted white.
