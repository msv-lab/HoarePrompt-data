Output State: **`test_cases` is 0; `results` is a list containing `res` values from each iteration; `n` is the last input integer; `num_list` is the last list of integers from the input; `num_of_lens` is the dictionary from the last iteration with each unique integer from `num_list` as keys and their respective counts as values; `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens` from the last iteration; `res` is the final accumulated value after all iterations.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all iterations, `test_cases` will be 0 because all test cases have been processed. The `results` list will contain the computed `res` values from each test case. The variables `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, and `total_count` will reflect the values from the last test case processed. The `res` variable will hold the final accumulated result from all test cases.
