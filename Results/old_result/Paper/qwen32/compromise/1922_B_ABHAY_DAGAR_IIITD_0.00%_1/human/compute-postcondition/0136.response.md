To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and understand the variables involved:

1. **test_cases**: This is set to 0, indicating the number of test cases processed. However, it doesn't directly affect the `result` variable.

2. **results**: This is a list containing at least one `res` value. The `result` variable is described as the "next element in the `results` list," which means it refers to a specific value within this list.

3. **n**: This is the last input integer. It's not directly relevant to the `result` variable in this context.

4. **num_list**: This is the last list of integers from the input. It's also not directly relevant to the `result` variable in this context.

5. **num_of_lens**: This is a dictionary from the last iteration with each unique integer from `num_list` as keys and their respective counts as values. This is also not directly relevant to the `result` variable in this context.

6. **total_count**: This is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens` from the last iteration. It's not directly relevant to the `result` variable in this context.

7. **res**: This is the final accumulated value after all iterations. This is also not directly relevant to the `result` variable in this context.

8. **result**: This is the next element in the `results` list. Since `results` contains at least one `res` value, `result` will be one of those values.

Given the information, we can conclude that `result` is a specific element from the `results` list. Since the exact content of the `results` list is not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `result`, but we know it is one of the elements in the `results` list.

Output: **result (where result is the next element in the `results` list)**
