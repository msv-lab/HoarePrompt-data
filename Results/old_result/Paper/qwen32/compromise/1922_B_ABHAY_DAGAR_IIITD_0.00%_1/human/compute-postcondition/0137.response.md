The provided loop simply iterates over the `results` list and prints each `result`. Since the loop's body does not modify any of the variables in the precondition except for the loop variable `result`, the state of the other variables remains unchanged. The loop will execute as many times as there are elements in the `results` list.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue until all elements in the `results` list have been printed. Therefore, the final output state after all iterations will be the same as the state after the last iteration, except that all elements in the `results` list will have been printed.

Output State: **`test_cases` is 0, `results` is a list containing all `res` values, `n` is the last input integer, `num_list` is the last list of integers from the input, `num_of_lens` is the dictionary from the last iteration with each unique integer from `num_list` as keys and their respective counts as values, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens` from the last iteration, `res` is the final accumulated value after all iterations.**

In simple terms, after all iterations, the program will have printed each element in the `results` list, and all other variables will retain their values from the last iteration.
