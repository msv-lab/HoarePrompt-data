The code snippet provided is:
```python
total_count += cnt
```
This line increments the value of `total_count` by the value of `cnt`.

Given the initial state:
- `test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples.
- `results` is a list containing `res` plus `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `results` remains `res`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one integer.
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with each unique integer from `num_list` as keys and their respective counts as values (and must have at least one key-value pair).
- `total_count` is `total_count + cnt_next`.
- `cnt` is `cnt_next`.
- If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.

After executing the code snippet, the value of `total_count` is updated to `total_count + cnt`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples; `results` is a list containing `res` plus `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `results` remains `res`; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with each unique integer from `num_list` as keys and their respective counts as values (and must have at least one key-value pair); `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`; `cnt` is `cnt_next`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.**
