To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the cumulative effect of the loop on the variables `res` and `total_count`. The loop iterates over the values in the dictionary `num_of_lens`, which contains the counts of unique integers in `num_list`.

Let's review the loop's logic:

1. For each count `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`:
   - If `cnt >= 3`, it calculates the number of combinations of 3 items from `cnt` items and adds it to `res`.
   - If `cnt >= 2`, it calculates the number of combinations of 2 items from `cnt` items, multiplies it by `total_count`, and adds it to `res`.
   - It then updates `total_count` by adding `cnt`.

Given the descriptions of the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue to iterate over all values in `num_of_lens`. The final state will be when all values in `num_of_lens` have been processed.

Let's denote the values in `num_of_lens` as `cnt1, cnt2, ..., cntk`. The final `total_count` will be the sum of all these counts, i.e., `total_count = cnt1 + cnt2 + ... + cntk`.

The final value of `res` will be the sum of:
- The number of combinations of 3 items from each count `cnt` where `cnt >= 3`, which is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.
- The number of combinations of 2 items from each count `cnt` where `cnt >= 2`, multiplied by the cumulative `total_count` at that point in the loop.

Thus, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `num_list` and values as their respective counts, `res` is the sum of all combinations of 3 items from counts `cnt >= 3` and all combinations of 2 items from counts `cnt >= 2` multiplied by the cumulative `total_count` at that point, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.**

In simpler terms, the loop finishes by updating `res` with all the necessary combinations and `total_count` with the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`) remain unchanged from their initial states except for `res` and `total_count`.
