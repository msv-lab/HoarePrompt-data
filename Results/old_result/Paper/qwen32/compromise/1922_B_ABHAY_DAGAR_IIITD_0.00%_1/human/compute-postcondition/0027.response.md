Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is 0, `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.**

Natural Language: The value of `res` is updated by adding the result of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to it. Since `total_count` is 0, the value of `res` remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial values.
