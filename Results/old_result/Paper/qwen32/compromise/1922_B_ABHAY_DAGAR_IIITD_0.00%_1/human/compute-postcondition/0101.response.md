The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`, which is the iterating variable for the list `num_list`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `num_list`. If there are more elements in `num_list` to iterate over, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the next element in `num_list`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` should be the subsequent element in `num_list`.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:
- `x` should be the next element in `num_list` after the current `x`.
- The other variables like `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, and `num_list` do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

Since we don't have the exact current value of `x` or the full `num_list`, we can only express the next state in terms of `x` being the next element in `num_list`.

State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples minus 1, `results` is a list containing `res` and the newly appended `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least two integers, `x` is the next element in `num_list`**.
