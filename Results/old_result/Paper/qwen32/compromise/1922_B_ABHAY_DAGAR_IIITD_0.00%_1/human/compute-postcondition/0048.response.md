The only variable in the loop head is `x`, which is the loop variable iterating over `num_list`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `num_list` has at least one element so that the loop can execute. The other variables mentioned (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `res`, `total_count`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is a list containing `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 integer, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is the sum of all combinations of 3 items from counts `cnt >= 3` and all combinations of 2 items from counts `cnt >= 2` multiplied by the cumulative `total_count` at that point, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`, and `test_cases` must be greater than the current iteration count**
