Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.**

Explanation: The value of `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to it. All other variables retain their previous states.
