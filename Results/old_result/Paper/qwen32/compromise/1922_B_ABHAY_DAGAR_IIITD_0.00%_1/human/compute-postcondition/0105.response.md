Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples minus 1, `results` is a list containing `res` and the newly appended `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `num_list`, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `num_of_lens` will contain each unique integer from `num_list` as keys, with their respective counts as values. The `total_count` will be the sum of all these counts, which should be equal to the length of `num_list`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop's body.
