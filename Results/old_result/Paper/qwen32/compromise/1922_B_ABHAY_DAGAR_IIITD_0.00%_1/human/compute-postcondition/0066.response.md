Postcondition: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is a list containing `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with each unique integer from `num_list` as keys and their respective counts as values (and must have at least one key-value pair), `res` is 0, `total_count` is 0, and `test_cases` must be greater than the current iteration count. Additionally, `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.**
