Postcondition: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples minus 1, `results` is a list containing `res` and the newly appended `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one integer. If `x` is a key in `num_of_lens`, the value associated with key `x` is incremented by 1, and `total_count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `x` is added to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1, and `total_count` is set to 1.**
