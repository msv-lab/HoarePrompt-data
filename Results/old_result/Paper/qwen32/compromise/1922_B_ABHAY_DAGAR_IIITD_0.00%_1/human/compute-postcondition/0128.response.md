To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variables evolve with each iteration. Given the loop's structure and the provided initial state and states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:

1. **`test_cases`**: This variable is not modified within the loop, so it remains the length of the list of tuples minus 1.
2. **`results`**: This list is updated with the new value of `res` after each iteration.
3. **`n`**: This variable is not modified within the loop, so it remains the input integer.
4. **`num_list`**: This list is not modified within the loop, so it remains the list of integers from the input.
5. **`num_of_lens`**: This dictionary is not modified within the loop, so it remains the dictionary with counts of occurrences of each integer in `num_list`.
6. **`total_count`**: This variable is incremented by `cnt` in each iteration.
7. **`res`**: This variable is updated based on the conditions inside the loop.

The loop iterates over the values of `num_of_lens`. For each `cnt` (count of occurrences of a unique integer in `num_list`):

- If `cnt >= 3`, `res` is incremented by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.
- If `cnt >= 2`, `res` is incremented by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.
- `total_count` is incremented by `cnt`.

After all iterations, the loop will have processed all the counts in `num_of_lens`. The final value of `res` will be the sum of all the contributions from each count, and `total_count` will be the sum of all counts.

Let's summarize the final state:

- `test_cases` remains the length of the list of tuples minus 1.
- `results` will be a list containing `res` and all the newly appended `res` values from each iteration.
- `n` remains the input integer.
- `num_list` remains the list of integers from the input.
- `num_of_lens` remains the dictionary with counts of occurrences of each integer in `num_list`.
- `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.
- `res` is the final accumulated value after all iterations.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples minus 1; `results` is a list containing `res` and the newly appended `res` values from each iteration; `n` is the input integer; `num_list` is the list of integers from the input; `num_of_lens` is the dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `num_list`; `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`; `res` is the final accumulated value after all iterations.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `results` will have all the intermediate and final `res` values, `total_count` will be the total number of integers in `num_list`, and `res` will be the final result calculated based on the counts of each unique integer in `num_list`.
