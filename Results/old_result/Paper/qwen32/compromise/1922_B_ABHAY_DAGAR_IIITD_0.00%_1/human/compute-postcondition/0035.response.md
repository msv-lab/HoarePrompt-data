Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.**

Explanation: The value of `total_count` has been incremented by `cnt`. All other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, `res`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged in terms of their definitions and values.
