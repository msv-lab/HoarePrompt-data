pergunta is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4). For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, representing the number of people in the queue (excluding Kirill) and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively. a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the cost Kirill has to pay to swap places with the i-th person. b is a list of n integers (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9) representing the additional cost Kirill has to pay to each person between the j-th and i-th positions when swapping with the j-th person. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
