Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The main issue lies in the logic used to calculate the minimum cost to purchase the tickets. The program attempts to sort the ticket prices and then greedily selects the cheapest days to buy tickets, but it does not account for the price increases that occur after purchasing tickets on a given day. This results in incorrect cost calculations.

Here's a brief explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Sorting the Prices**: The program sorts the prices and then selects the cheapest days to buy tickets. However, after purchasing tickets on a given day, the prices for subsequent days increase, which the program does not account for.

2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation logic is flawed. It does not correctly account for the increasing prices after purchases, leading to incorrect results.

To solve this problem correctly, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm that properly accounts for the price increases.
