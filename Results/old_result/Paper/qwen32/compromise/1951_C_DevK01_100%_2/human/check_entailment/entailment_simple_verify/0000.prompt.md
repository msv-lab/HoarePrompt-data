You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase exactly k tickets given the constraints. The main issues are:

1. **Sorting the Prices**: The program sorts the prices in ascending order and then selects the smallest prices. However, this approach does not account for the price increase mechanism. If you buy tickets on a day, the prices for subsequent days increase by the number of tickets bought. Therefore, buying tickets on days with initially higher prices might sometimes be more cost-effective if it allows you to buy more tickets on subsequent days at increased prices.

2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation logic does not correctly account for the price increases. The program calculates the cost based on a fixed number of tickets bought each day without considering the price increases dynamically.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the number of tickets to be bought is exactly equal to the number of days or when the maximum number of tickets per day is very large.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

**Example:**
```
1
5 3 9
5 5 5 5 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
45
```

**Explanation:**
- You can buy 3 tickets on the first day for 15 (5 + 5 + 5).
- The prices for the remaining days will be [8, 8, 8, 8].
- You can buy 3 tickets on the second day for 24 (8 + 8 + 8).
- The prices for the remaining days will be [11, 11, 11].
- You can buy 3 tickets on the third day for 33 (11 + 11 + 11).
- The prices for the remaining days will be [14, 14].
- You can buy the last ticket on the fourth day for 14.

Total cost: 15 + 24 + 33 + 14 = 86 (this is not the minimum cost).

However, the optimal way is to buy:
- 3 tickets on the first day for 15 (5 + 5 + 5).
- 3 tickets on the second day for 24 (8 + 8 + 8).
- 3 tickets on the third day for 33 (11 + 11 + 11).

Total cost: 15 + 24 + 33 = 72.

The provided program will not yield the correct result for this case because it does not dynamically adjust the number of tickets bought each day based on the price increases.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
