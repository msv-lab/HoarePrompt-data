Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to purchase exactly `k` tickets over `n` days with the goal of minimizing the total cost. The price of tickets can increase based on the number of tickets purchased on previous days.

### Key Points:
1. **Constraints**: 
   - We can buy up to `m` tickets per day.
   - Buying `x` tickets on day `i` increases the price of tickets by `x` for all subsequent days.
2. **Objective**: Minimize the total cost to buy `k` tickets.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Sorting the prices of tickets in ascending order.
2. Calculating the number of days (`q`) required to buy `k` tickets, considering the maximum tickets (`m`) that can be bought per day.
3. Splitting the first `q` days to buy tickets, adjusting the cost based on the number of tickets bought and the resulting price increases.

#### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the cost in a way that does not correctly account for the price increases for all tickets bought on each day.
   - The formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is too simplistic and does not accurately reflect the price increases.
   - The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the total tickets bought do not perfectly align with `q * m`.

2. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The program's logic for handling the remainder tickets (`mu`) and adjusting the cost is flawed.
   - The formula `n * m * mu` is incorrect and does not account for the increasing prices correctly.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets. The logic and cost calculation are flawed, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
