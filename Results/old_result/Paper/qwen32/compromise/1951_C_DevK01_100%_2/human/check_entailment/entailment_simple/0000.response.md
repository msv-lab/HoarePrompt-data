Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets given the constraints. Here are the issues with the current approach:

1. **Sorting the Prices**: The program sorts the prices of the tickets across all days and then tries to purchase tickets based on the sorted order. This approach does not consider the sequential nature of the problem where purchasing tickets on a particular day increases the price of subsequent days.

2. **Greedy Strategy**: The program attempts to use a greedy strategy by purchasing tickets from the cheapest available price, but it does not take into account the impact of the purchased tickets on future prices. This can lead to suboptimal solutions.

3. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation is incorrect. The program does not properly account for the increase in prices due to the tickets purchased on previous days.

4. **Handling Remaining Tickets**: The program does not correctly handle the situation where the number of tickets to be purchased (`k`) is not a multiple of the maximum tickets that can be bought per day (`m`).

To solve this problem correctly, a dynamic programming or a more sophisticated greedy approach that considers the sequential nature of the price increases is required. The program should simulate the process of purchasing tickets day by day, keeping track of the total cost and the remaining tickets to be purchased, while also updating the prices accordingly.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
