### Reasoning:

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem described. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of how the code works and why it should be correct:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes each test case one by one. For each test case, it first reads the number of signs `n` and then reads the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes `last_year` with the first periodicity `a[0]`. This means the first sign occurs in the `a[0]`-th year.
   - It then iterates through the remaining periodicities. For each periodicity `a[i]`, it calculates the next year (`next_year`) when the next sign will occur. The formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` ensures that the next sign occurs on the next multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly after `last_year`.
   - The `last_year` is then updated to `next_year` for the next iteration.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program outputs the final year for each test case.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the first test case from the example:

- **Input:** `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
- **Processing:**
  - First sign occurs in year `3`.
  - Second sign occurs in year `4` (next multiple of `2` after `3`).
  - Third sign occurs in year `8` (next multiple of `4` after `4`).
  - Fourth sign occurs in year `10` (next multiple of `5` after `8`).
  - Fifth sign occurs in year `18` (next multiple of `9` after `10`).
  - Sixth sign occurs in year `36` (next multiple of `18` after `18`).
- **Output:** `36`

This matches the expected output for the first test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The program correctly processes each test case by calculating the year of occurrence for each sign based on the given periodicities and ensures the signs occur sequentially.
Correctness: **True**
