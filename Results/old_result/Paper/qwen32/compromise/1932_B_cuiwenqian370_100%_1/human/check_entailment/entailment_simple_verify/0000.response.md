### Reasoning:
The original assessment provides a thorough analysis of the program and the logic it employs to solve the problem. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step to ensure the program's correctness:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through this list to extract the number of test cases `T` and the details of each test case.
   - For each test case, it extracts the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Logic for Calculating the Year of the n-th Sign:**
   - The program initializes `last_year` with the first sign's occurrence year, which is `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next occurrence year using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. This formula ensures that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.

3. **Validation with Example Test Cases:**
   - The original assessment provides detailed explanations for each example test case, showing how the program correctly computes the year of the n-th sign.
   - The calculations match the expected results, indicating that the program handles the provided examples correctly.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where all signs occur every year (`a_i = 1` for all `i`), as seen in the third example test case.
   - It also handles cases with larger periodicities and multiple test cases, as seen in the fourth example test case.

5. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations in the annotated version of the code provide a clear state of the program at key points, confirming that the program processes the input correctly and updates the `last_year` variable as expected.

### Conclusion:
Based on the detailed analysis and the provided annotations, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all the given examples and edge cases appropriately.

### Final:
Final: **True**
