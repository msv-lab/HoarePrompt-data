The code assigns the value of the first element of the list `a` to the variable `last_year`. No other variables are changed by this code snippet. Therefore, the value of `last_year` will be `a[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, with `data[0]` being a string representation of an integer T such that 1 <= T <= 1000; `index` is `2 + n`; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[2:2+n]`; `last_year` is `a[0]`.**
