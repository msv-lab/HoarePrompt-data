The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 3. The value of `n` remains the same since it is the upper bound for the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, with `data[0]` being a string representation of an integer T such that 1 <= T <= 1000; `index` is `2 + n`; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[2:2+n]`; `last_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`; `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`; `i` is 3**
