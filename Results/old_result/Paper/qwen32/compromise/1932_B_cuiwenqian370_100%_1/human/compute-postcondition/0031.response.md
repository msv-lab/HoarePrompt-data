Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `results` includes `str(last_year)`, `T` is still greater than the current number of iterations, `n` is still greater than 1, `index` is incremented by `n`, `a` is derived from `data[index - n:index]`, `last_year` is `(a[0] + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`, `next_year` is `(a[0] + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`.**

In natural language: The value of `last_year` is updated to be equal to `next_year`, which is calculated as `(a[0] + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
