To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression `next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` with the given initial state where `i` is 4 and `n` is unchanged. We will assume that `last_year` and `a` are defined in the initial state, but their specific values are not provided. Therefore, we will express `next_year` in terms of `last_year` and `a[4]`.

Let's break down the expression:

1. `a[i]` becomes `a[4]` because `i` is 4.
2. The expression inside the parentheses is `last_year + 1 + a[4] - 1`, which simplifies to `last_year + a[4]`.
3. The expression then becomes `(last_year + a[4]) // a[4] * a[4]`. The `//` operator performs integer division, which means it divides `last_year + a[4]` by `a[4]` and takes the floor of the result.
4. The result of the integer division `(last_year + a[4]) // a[4]` will be 1 if `last_year` is less than `a[4]`, and it will be `last_year // a[4] + 1` if `last_year` is a multiple of `a[4]` or greater than `a[4]`.
5. Multiplying the result of the integer division by `a[4]` will give us `a[4]` if `last_year` is less than `a[4]`, and it will give us the next multiple of `a[4]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1` if `last_year` is greater than or equal to `a[4]`.

Given the initial state and the expression, we can express `next_year` as:
- `next_year` is the next multiple of `a[4]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is unchanged, `next_year` is the next multiple of `a[4]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.**
