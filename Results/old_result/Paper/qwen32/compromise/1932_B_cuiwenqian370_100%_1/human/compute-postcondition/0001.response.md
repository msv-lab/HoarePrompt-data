The code reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. The variable `data` is assigned this list. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and for each test case, there is an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. However, the code provided does not parse these values; it merely splits the input into a list of strings.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.**
