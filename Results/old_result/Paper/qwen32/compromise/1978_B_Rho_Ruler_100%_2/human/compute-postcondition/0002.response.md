To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the loop condition `low <= high`. Given the initial state:

- `low` is 0
- `high` is `min(n, b)`

Since `low` is 0, and `high` is `min(n, b)`, the loop will execute if `0 <= min(n, b)`. Given that `n` and `b` are both integers in the range `[1, 10^9]`, `min(n, b)` will always be at least 1. Therefore, `0 <= min(n, b)` will always be true.

No adjustments are needed because the condition `low <= high` is already satisfied with the given initial state.

State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is min(n, b); `max_profit` is 0**
