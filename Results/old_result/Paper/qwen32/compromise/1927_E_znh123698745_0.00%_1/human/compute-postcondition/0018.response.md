Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `k` is even; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `i` is `n`. If `i` is odd, `array` has its last element set to `n - 1` and `answer` is a list containing the integer `n`. Otherwise, `answer` has an additional element which is `array[a[0]]` and `a[0]` is incremented by 1.**
