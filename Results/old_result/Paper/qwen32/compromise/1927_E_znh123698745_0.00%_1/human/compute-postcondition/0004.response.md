The code snippet provided assigns a new list `[1, -1]` to the variable `a`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `array`, or `answer`. Therefore, the only change in the state is the introduction of the new variable `a` with the specified list.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, k is even, and `array` is a list of integers from 1 to n inclusive; `answer` is a list containing the integer 1; `a` is a list containing the integers [1, -1].**
