The value of `a[0]` is incremented by 1. Initially, `a` is `[1, -1]`, so after the operation `a[0] += 1`, `a` becomes `[2, -1]`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `answer` is `[1, 2]`, `a` is `[2, -1]`, `array` is a list containing the sequence from 1 to `n`**.
