The code snippet `a[-1] -= 1` modifies the last element of the list `a`. Initially, `a` is a list containing the integers `[1, -1]`. By subtracting 1 from the last element of `a`, the last element changes from `-1` to `-2`.

Therefore, the updated list `a` becomes `[1, -2]`.

The values of `n`, `k`, `array`, and `answer` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `k` is even; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to n inclusive; `answer` is a list containing the integers [1, n]; `a` is a list containing the integers [1, -2]**.
