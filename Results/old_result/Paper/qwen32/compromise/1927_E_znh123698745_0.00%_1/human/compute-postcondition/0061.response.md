The code `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends the element of `array` at the index specified by the last element of `a` to the `answer` list. 

Given:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `k` is an input integer (its value is not used in this code snippet).
- `answer` is `[1]`.
- `a` is `[1, -1]`.
- `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n`, and `(-1)` (which seems like a typo and should be ignored as it's not a valid list element).

The last element of `a` is `-1`. When used as an index, `-1` refers to the last element of `array`. Since `array` contains integers from 1 to `n`, the last element of `array` is `n`.

Therefore, `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends `n` to `answer`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `answer` is `[1, n]`, `a` is `[1, -1]`, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n`.**
