To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n` in this case.

Here's the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the `range(1, n)` function generates numbers starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

The state before the loop starts is:
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `answer` is `[1]`
- `a` is `[1, -1]`
- `array` is a list containing the sequence from 1 to `n`

Since the state of `k`, `answer`, `a`, and `array` does not affect the execution of the loop, we only need to adjust `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

### Steps to Adjust the State:
1. Ensure `n` is greater than 1 to make the loop execute.
2. The variable `i` does not need to be set before the loop starts as it will be initialized by the `range` function.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `answer` is `[1]`, `a` is `[1, -1]`, `array` is a list containing the sequence from 1 to `n`**
