The code snippet `answer.append(array[a[0]])` appends the element at index `a[0]` from the `array` to the `answer` list. Given that `a[0]` is `1`, the element at index `1` of `array` is `2` (since `array` is a list of integers from `1` to `n` inclusive and Python uses 0-based indexing).

Therefore, `answer` will now contain `[1, 2]`.

The values of `n`, `k`, and the rest of the variables (`array`, `a`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is even, and `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `answer` is a list containing the integers [1, 2]; `a` is a list containing the integers [1, -1]; `i` is an integer such that `(-1)`**
