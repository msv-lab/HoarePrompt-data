The code snippet `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends the element from `array` at the index specified by the last element of `a` to the `answer` list. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `k` is even.
- `array` is a list of integers from 1 to n inclusive.
- `answer` is a list containing the integer 1.
- `a` is a list containing the integers [1, -1].
- `i` is an integer such that `(-1)` (This last part seems to be incomplete or incorrect in the initial state, so we will ignore it for the purpose of this task).

The last element of `a` is `-1`. Therefore, `array[a[-1]]` refers to `array[-1]`, which is the last element of `array`. Since `array` contains integers from 1 to n inclusive, `array[-1]` is `n`.

Thus, `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends `n` to the `answer` list.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `k` is even; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to n inclusive; `answer` is a list containing the integers [1, n]; `a` is a list containing the integers [1, -1].**
