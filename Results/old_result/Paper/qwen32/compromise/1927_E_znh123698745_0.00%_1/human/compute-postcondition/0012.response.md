Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `k` is even; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. If `(-1) ** i == -1`, then `answer` is a list containing the integers [1, `n`] and `a` is a list containing the integers [1, -2]. Otherwise, `answer` is a list containing the integers [1, 2] and `a` is a list containing the integers [2, -1].**
