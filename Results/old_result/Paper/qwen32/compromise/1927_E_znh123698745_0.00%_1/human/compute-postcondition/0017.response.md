Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `k` is even; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `i` is `n`; `answer` has an additional element which is `array[a[0]]`; `a[0]` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `a[0]` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged, including `n`, `k`, `array`, and `i`. The `answer` list has an additional element which is `array[a[0]]` from before the increment.
