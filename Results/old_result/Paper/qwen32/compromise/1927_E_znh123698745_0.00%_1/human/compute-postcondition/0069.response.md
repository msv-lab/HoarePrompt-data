The code snippet `a[-1] -= 1` modifies the last element of the list `a`. Given the initial state, it seems there was a typo and the list should be `array` instead of `a`. Assuming the correct list is `array`, the last element of `array` will be decremented by 1.

Since `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n`, the last element of `array` is `n`. After decrementing it by 1, the last element becomes `n - 1`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `i`, `answer`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n-1` with the last element decremented by 1, `i` is 2, `answer` contains the value `3`**
