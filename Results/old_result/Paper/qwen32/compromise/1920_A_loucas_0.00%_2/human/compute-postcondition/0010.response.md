The code snippet appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `loop` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `less` is an empty list, `big` is a list containing the integer `a`, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is 1, `a` is an integer read from the input.**
