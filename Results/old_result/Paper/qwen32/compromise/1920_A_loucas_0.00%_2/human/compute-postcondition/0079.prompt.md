Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num` is 0, `iterable` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `loop` remains unchanged, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `innerLoop` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `num` is 0, `iterable` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `loop` remains unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the input. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the value of `a` and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing the value of `a` and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `no` is a list containing the value of `a` and `less` and `big` are empty lists.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `num` is 0, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `loop` remains unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than `iterable2`, `iterable2` is incremented by 1, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `big`, `less`, and `no` are initialized based on the new value of `x`. If `x` is 1, `big` contains the value of `a`. If `x` is 2, `less` includes `a` as its last element. Otherwise, `no` includes `a` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `big` is a list that includes `a` as its last element if `x` is 1, `less` includes `a` as its last element if `x` is 2, `no` includes `a` as its last element if `x` is not 1 or 2, `num` is 0, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `loop` remains unchanged, `innerLoop` remains unchanged, `iterable2` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
