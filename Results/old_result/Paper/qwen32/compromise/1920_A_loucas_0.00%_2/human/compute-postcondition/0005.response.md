The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `num`. The other variables `t`, `loop`, `less`, `big`, and `no` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `loop` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0**.
