The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `big`, and `less`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `max(big)` and `min(less)`. If `i` is less than `min(less)`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current value, `iterable` is incremented by 1, and `big` and `less` remain unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `min(less)`.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`num` is `i+1` if `i+1` is not in the list `no`; otherwise, `num` remains 0, `iterable` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `loop` and `innerLoop` remain unchanged, `big` is a non-empty list, `less` is a non-empty list, and `max(big) < min(less)`. If `i+1` is not in `no`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.** 

However, since we are only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, we only need to adjust `i`:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`**
