The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `big`. The other variables `t`, `loop`, and `less` are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `loop` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list.**
