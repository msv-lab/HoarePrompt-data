Output State: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is a valid integer (e.g., 0), `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `loop` remains unchanged, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer.**

Natural language: The values of `num`, `iterable`, `innerLoop`, `big`, `less`, `no`, and `loop` remain unchanged. The variables `x` and `a` are assigned the values of two integers provided by the input, separated by a space.
