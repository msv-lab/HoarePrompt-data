### Reasoning:
The problem involves determining the winner of a game where Alice and Bob take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins until one player cannot make a move. The key observation is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins (a + b).

- If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob wins.
- If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, Alice wins.

This is because:
- When the total number of coins is even, Alice will always face a situation where the total number of coins left is odd on her turn, and Bob will always face an even number of coins on his turn. Eventually, Bob will be the one to face 1 coin left, and Alice will be unable to make a move.
- Conversely, when the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always face an odd number of coins on her turn, and Bob will always face an even number. Alice will be the one to face 1 coin left, and Bob will be unable to make a move.

The provided program correctly implements this logic in `func_1` by checking the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`. If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob', and if the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'. `func_2` handles multiple test cases and prints the results accordingly.
