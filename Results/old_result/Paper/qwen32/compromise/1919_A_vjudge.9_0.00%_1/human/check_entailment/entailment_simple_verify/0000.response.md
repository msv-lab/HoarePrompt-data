### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic based on the parity of the total number of coins (a + b) to determine the winner of the game. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Key Insight:**
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob will win.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, Alice will win.

2. **Function `func_1(a, b)`:**
   - The function checks if the sum `a + b` is even or odd.
   - If `a + b` is even, it returns 'Bob'.
   - If `a + b` is odd, it returns 'Alice'.
   - This matches the optimal strategy derived from the problem analysis.

3. **Function `func_2()`:**
   - It reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`.
   - It calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner and stores the result.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
   - This function correctly handles multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to determine the winner for each case.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the program is correctly evaluating the conditions and returning the appropriate winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.

### Final Evaluation:
The given program is correct.

**Final: True**
