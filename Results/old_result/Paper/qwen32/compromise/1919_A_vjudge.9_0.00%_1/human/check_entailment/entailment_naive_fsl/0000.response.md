Let's analyze the provided code to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns with their wallets. Each player can either swap wallets or not, and then they must remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a move (i.e., when both wallets are empty) loses. The goal is to determine who will win if both play optimally.

### Key Insight:
The optimal strategy involves considering the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins (a + b). If the total number of coins is even, Bob will win. If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will win. This is because:
- If the total number of coins is even, Alice will always leave Bob with an odd number of coins after her turn, and Bob can always leave Alice with an even number of coins after his turn. Eventually, Bob will be left with the last coin and Alice will lose.
- If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always leave Bob with an even number of coins after her turn, and Bob will always leave Alice with an odd number of coins after his turn. Eventually, Alice will be left with the last coin and Bob will lose.

### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: Determines the winner based on the parity of `a + b`.
2. `func_2()`: Handles input and output for multiple test cases.

Let's verify if the code correctly implements the above logic:

#### Function `func_1(a, b)`:
- It checks if the sum `a + b` is even or odd.
- If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'.
- If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.

This matches the optimal strategy derived from the problem analysis.

#### Function `func_2()`:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`.
- It calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner and stores the result.
- Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

This function correctly handles multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to determine the winner for each case.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic based on the parity of the total number of coins and handles multiple test cases as required by the problem description.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins in both Alice's and Bob's wallets. It handles multiple test cases and outputs the correct winner for each case.
