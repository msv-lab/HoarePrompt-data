The code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. This action does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, or `t`. The `results` list is now ready to store the outcomes of the test cases.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; `t` is the number of test cases entered by the user; `results` is an empty list.**
