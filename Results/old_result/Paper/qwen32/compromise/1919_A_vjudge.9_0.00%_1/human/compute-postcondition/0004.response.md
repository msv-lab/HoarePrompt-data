The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`, which iterates over the `results` list. To ensure that the loop can execute, the `results` list must contain at least one element. The values of `a`, `b`, and `t` are not directly related to the execution of the for loop and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`a` and `b` are the values from the last test case, `t` is unchanged, `results` is a list containing the winners for each test case that must have at least 1 element, `result` is the first element in the `results` list**
