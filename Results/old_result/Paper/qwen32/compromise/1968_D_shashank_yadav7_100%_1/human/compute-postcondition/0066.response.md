Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `i` is any integer (it will be set to 0 at the start of the loop); `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `k` is an input integer minus 1; `b` is an input integer minus 1; `s` is an input integer minus 1; `a` is a new list of integers read from the input; `sp` is `a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b]`; `bm` is `a[b] * (k + 1)`; `sm` is `sp * (k + 1)`; `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`; `p` is a list of integers read from the input. If `k` is equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
