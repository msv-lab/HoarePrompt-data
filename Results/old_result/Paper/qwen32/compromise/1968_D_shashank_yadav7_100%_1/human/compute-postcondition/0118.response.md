Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is `min(n, k)` (which is 0 because `k` is 0), `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, `b` is the third integer from the input minus 1, `s` is the fourth integer from the input minus 1, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `sm` is 0 (since `k` is 0), `bm` is 0 (since `k` is 0), `p` is a list of integers read from the input, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
