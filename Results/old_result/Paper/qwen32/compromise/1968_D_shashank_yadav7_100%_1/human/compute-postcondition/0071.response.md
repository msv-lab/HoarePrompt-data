The value of `sp` is incremented by `a[s]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `i` is any integer (it will be set to 0 at the start of the loop); `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `k` is an input integer minus 1; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `a` is a new list of integers read from the input; `sp` is `a[s] + a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b]`; `sm` is the maximum of `(a[s] - 1) * (k + 1)` and `a[s] * k + (a[s] - 1)`; `bm` is `max(a[b] * (k + 1), a[b] * k + bp)`; `p` is a list of integers read from the input. If `k` is equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
