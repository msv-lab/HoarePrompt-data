Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is unchanged (its value is not explicitly provided).
- `k` is initialized to 0.
- `b` is defined as `p[b] - 1`.
- `s` is defined as `p[s] - 1`.
- `a` is unchanged (its value is not explicitly provided).
- `sp` is defined as `2 * a[s]`.
- `bp` is defined as `2 * a[b]`.
- `sm` is defined as `a[s]`.
- `bm` is defined as `max(0, bp)`.
- `p` is unchanged (its value is not explicitly provided).
- It is mentioned that `bm` is less than `sm`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Sasha')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward. It prints the string `'Sasha'` without referencing any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the value to be printed is explicitly given by the string within the `print` function.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'Sasha'`.

Output: **Sasha**
