Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 2; `k` is an integer that has been decremented by 3 from its initial value; `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `p` is a list of integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `sp` is `2 * a[s] + a[s]`; `bp` is `3 * a[b]`; `bm` is `max(a[b] * k, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is `max(max(a[s] * k, a[s] * k + sp), a[s] * k + sp)`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The execution of the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
