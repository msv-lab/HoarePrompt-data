The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'Bodya'. The initial state provides several variable definitions and conditions, but none of these affect the output of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `sm`, `bm`, and `p`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print('Bodya')`.
2. The string 'Bodya' is explicitly provided and will be output as is.
3. None of the variables or conditions in the initial state influence the content of the string 'Bodya'.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply 'Bodya'.

Output: **Bodya**
