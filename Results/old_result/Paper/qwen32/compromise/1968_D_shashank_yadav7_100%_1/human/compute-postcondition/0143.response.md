The code snippet `sp += a[s]` adds the value of `a[s]` to the current value of `sp`. 

Given the initial state, `sp` is initially `3 * a[s]`. After the execution of the code, `sp` becomes `3 * a[s] + a[s]`, which simplifies to `4 * a[s]`.

The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[p[s] - 1] - 1] - 1`, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `sp` is `4 * a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `bm` is `max(a[b], max(0, bp), a[b] * k + bp)`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
