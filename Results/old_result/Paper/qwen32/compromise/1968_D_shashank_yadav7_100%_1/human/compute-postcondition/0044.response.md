The provided initial state describes a complex set of variables and operations, but the task is straightforward in terms of what the `print` statement will output. The `print` statement is:

```python
print('Bodya')
```

This `print` statement is independent of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm`. The string `'Bodya'` is explicitly provided and will be printed as is, regardless of the values of the other variables.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'Bodya'`.

Output: **Bodya**
