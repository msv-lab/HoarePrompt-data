Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The program is supposed to simulate a game where two players, Bodya and Sasha, move through a permutation array and accumulate scores based on the values in another array. The game lasts for `k` turns, and the player with the higher score at the end wins.

Here's the provided program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        sp = a[s]
        bp = a[b]
        bm = a[b] * k
        sm = a[s] * k
        for i in range(n):
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                break
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
            sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
            sp += a[s]
            bp += a[b]
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`.
   - It adjusts `b` and `s` to be zero-indexed.
   - It initializes `sp` and `bp` with the initial scores of Sasha and Bodya, respectively.
   - It initializes `bm` and `sm` with the maximum possible scores if the players stay in their positions for all `k` turns.

2. **Game Simulation**:
   - The loop runs for `n` iterations, but it breaks if `k` becomes zero.
   - In each iteration, it decrements `k` by 1.
   - It updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation array `p`.
   - It updates the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha by considering the scores if they stay in their current positions for the remaining `k` turns.
   - It adds the scores of the current positions to `sp` and `bp`.

3. **Decision Making**:
   - After the loop, it compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, and "Draw" if their scores are equal.

### Issues:

1. **Logic for Maximum Possible Scores**:
   - The logic for calculating `bm` and `sm` is incorrect. The code multiplies the current score by the remaining turns `k` and adds it to the previous score. This does not correctly simulate the game where the player can choose to stay or move in each turn.
   - The code should simulate the game correctly by accumulating scores based on the choices made by the players.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where the players get stuck in cycles or loops within the permutation array. It should correctly handle such cases to ensure the scores are calculated accurately.

### Example of Incorrectness:

Consider the following test case:
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

- Initial positions: Bodya at 3, Sasha at 2.
- Scores: Bodya's initial score = 5, Sasha's initial score = 2.
- After 1st turn:
  - Bodya stays at 3, score = 5 + 5 = 10.
  - Sasha moves to 1, score = 2 + 7 = 9.
- After 2nd turn:
  - Bodya stays at 3, score = 10 + 5 = 15.
  - Sasha moves to 2, score = 9 + 2 = 11.

The correct output should be "Bodya", but the program might not handle this correctly due to the flawed logic for calculating `bm` and `sm`.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. The logic for calculating the maximum possible scores and handling the game turns is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
