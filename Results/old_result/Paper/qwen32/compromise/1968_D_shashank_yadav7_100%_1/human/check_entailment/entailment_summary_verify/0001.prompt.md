You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        sp = a[s]
        bp = a[b]
        bm = a[b] * k
        sm = a[s] * k
        for i in range(n):

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each involving several integers and two lists. For each test case, it calculates and compares two values based on the given inputs and prints whether "Bodya" wins, "Sasha" wins, or if it is a "Draw".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap
- We have two players, Bodya and Sasha, who start at different positions in a permutation array.
- They play a game for `k` turns.
- On each turn, a player's score increases by the value at their current position in a given array `a`.
- After updating the score, a player can either stay in their current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation array `p`.
- The goal is to determine who has the higher score after `k` turns.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - Reading `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`.
   - Reading the permutation array `p` and the score array `a`.
   - Adjusting `P_B` and `P_S` to be zero-indexed.
   - Initializing scores for Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions.
   - Simulating the game for `k` turns, updating the scores and positions of Bodya and Sasha.
   - Comparing the final scores and outputting the result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").

### Key Points in the Program
- The program correctly initializes the scores and positions.
- It simulates the game for `k` turns, updating both players' positions and scores according to the rules.
- It correctly handles the case where `k` is very large by using the loop condition `k -= 1` and `if k == 0: break`.

### Issues and Corrections
- **Inefficient Calculation of Scores**: The program attempts to calculate the maximum possible scores by considering the scores at each step, but this approach is flawed. It should simulate the game exactly `k` times and compare the final scores.
- **Incorrect Score Calculation**: The program calculates `bm` and `sm` incorrectly. Instead of accumulating the scores over `k` turns, it tries to calculate a maximum score based on remaining turns, which is not the intended logic.

### Correct Approach
The correct approach is to:
1. Initialize the scores for Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions.
2. Simulate the game for exactly `k` turns, updating the scores and positions for both players.
3. Compare the final scores after `k` turns.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. It incorrectly attempts to calculate the maximum possible scores, which is not the correct approach. The program should simulate the game exactly `k` times and compare the final scores.

Thus, the correctness of the given program is:
Correctness: **False**
