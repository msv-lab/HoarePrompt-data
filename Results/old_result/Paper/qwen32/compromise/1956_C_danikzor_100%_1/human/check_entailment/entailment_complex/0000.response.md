### Reasoning:

The given program is supposed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of elements in an `n x n` matrix using a limited number of operations. The operations allowed are:

1. **Type 1 operation**: Assign a row `i` with a permutation of numbers from `n` to `1`.
2. **Type 2 operation**: Assign a column `i` with a permutation of numbers from `n` to `1`.

The program calculates the maximum sum that can be achieved and prints the operations required to achieve this sum. Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Output Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum sum of the matrix as `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`.
   - This formula is derived from the fact that we can fill the matrix with permutations that maximize the sum. For each row and column, the sum of the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]` is `n * (n + 1) / 2`. By filling each row and column with this permutation, we achieve the maximum sum.

3. **Operation Generation**:
   - For each row `i` from `1` to `n`, the program performs a Type 1 operation, setting the row `i` to the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.
   - For each column `i` from `1` to `n`, the program performs a Type 2 operation, setting the column `i` to the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.
   - This results in `2 * n` operations, which is within the allowed limit.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - It then prints the operations in the required format.

### Verification:

- The maximum sum formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is correct. It can be derived from the sum of the first `n` natural numbers and the fact that we will be filling each row and column with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.
- The operations generated by the program are correct. By filling each row and column with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`, we ensure that the sum of the matrix is maximized.
- The number of operations is `2 * n`, which is within the allowed limit of `2 * n`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and generates the required operations within the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
