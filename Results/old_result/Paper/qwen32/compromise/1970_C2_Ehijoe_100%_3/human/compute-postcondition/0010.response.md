To solve this, we need to understand the effect of the function call `moves = func_1(nodes, start)`. However, the definition of `func_1` is not provided, so we will assume that it performs some operations on the `nodes` and `start` and returns a value which is assigned to `moves`.

Given the initial state, we know that:
- `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists representing the adjacency list of a graph.
- `start` is the starting node for some operation.
- `n` is the number of nodes.
- `t` is some additional integer input.
- `edges` is an empty list.
- `empty` is a boolean indicating whether `edges` is empty (which it is, as it's initialized as an empty list).
- `leaves` is a deque containing all leaf nodes (nodes with only one adjacent node).

After executing `moves = func_1(nodes, start)`, the value of `moves` will be whatever `func_1` returns. The other variables (`nodes`, `start`, `n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`, `leaves`) will remain unchanged unless `func_1` modifies them directly, which is not indicated in the provided code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State will be:

Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node (from 1 to n) and its value is a list of adjacent nodes, `start` is the integer read from the input, `n` remains the first integer read from the input, `t` remains the second integer read from the input, `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains True, `leaves` is a deque containing all nodes that have only one adjacent node (leaf nodes), `moves` is the value returned by `func_1(nodes, start)`**.
