You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nodes is a defaultdict of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with n nodes, start is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, and 1 <= start <= n.
def func_2():
    n, t = map(int, input().split())
    edges = []
    empty = True
    nodes = defaultdict(list)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        u, v = map(int, input().split())
        
        nodes[u].append(v)
        
        nodes[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node (from 1 to n) and its value is a list of adjacent nodes as defined by the edges input, `start` remains the same integer representing the starting node, `n` remains the first integer read from the input, `t` remains the second integer read from the input, `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains True.
    leaves = deque()
    for key in nodes:
        if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
            leaves.append(key)
        
    #State: `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node (from 1 to n) and its value is a list of adjacent nodes, `start` remains the same integer representing the starting node, `n` remains the first integer read from the input, `t` remains the second integer read from the input, `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains True, `leaves` is a deque containing all nodes that have only one adjacent node (leaf nodes).
    start = int(input())
    moves = func_1(nodes, start)
    if moves :
        print('Ron')
        #This is printed: Ron
    else :
        print('Hermione')
        #This is printed: Hermione
    #State: `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node (from 1 to n) and its value is a list of adjacent nodes, `start` is the integer read from the input, `n` remains the first integer read from the input, `t` remains the second integer read from the input, `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains True, `leaves` is a deque containing all nodes that have only one adjacent node (leaf nodes), and `moves` is the value returned by `func_1(nodes, start)`. If `moves` is truthy, then the code proceeds with the if part; otherwise, `moves` is False.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `nodes`, which is a defaultdict of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` nodes, and `start`, an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, with the constraint that `1 <= start <= n`. The function returns a value that is not explicitly detailed in the provided output description, but it is implied to perform some operation related to the tree structure starting from the `start` node.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
