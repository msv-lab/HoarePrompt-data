### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a tree with `n` nodes.
   - The game starts with a stone on a specified node.
   - Players alternate turns moving the stone to an adjacent inactive node.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.
   - We need to determine the winner if both players play optimally.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The game can be analyzed using the concept of "Grundy numbers" or "Nimbers" from combinatorial game theory.
   - In this specific problem, we can simplify the analysis by considering the structure of the tree and the starting position of the stone.
   - If the starting node is part of a path with an odd number of nodes, Ron wins.
   - If the starting node is part of a path with an even number of nodes, Hermione wins.
   - This is because the player who starts on an odd-length path can always force the opponent to face an even-length path, and vice versa.

3. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The function `func_1` is a recursive function that checks if there is a way to force a win for the starting player.
   - It does this by exploring all possible moves and checking if there is any move that leads to a losing position for the opponent.
   - The function `func_2` handles the input parsing and calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments.
   - The output is determined based on the result of `func_1`.

4. **Correctness of the Code:**
   - The recursive function `func_1` correctly implements the logic of checking if there is a winning move for the starting player.
   - It uses the principle that if there is any child node that leads to a losing position for the opponent, the current player can force a win.
   - The function `func_2` correctly parses the input and uses `func_1` to determine the winner for the given starting node.
   - The logic in the code is consistent with the game theory analysis mentioned above.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the given starting node and the structure of the tree.

**Correctness: True**
