The provided code snippet is `a = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`. This line assigns the string containing all lowercase Latin letters to the variable `a`. The initial state mentioned other variables `t`, `n`, and `a` (which was a list of integers), but the code snippet only modifies `a` to be a string of the alphabet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that for each test case, there exists a suitable string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z.**
