`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `t` and `b` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `b` is a list of 26 zeros; `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `b` is a list of 26 zeros; `n` is an input integer.**
