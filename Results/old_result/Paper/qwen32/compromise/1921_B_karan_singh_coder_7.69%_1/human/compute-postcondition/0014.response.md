Output State: **t is a string representing the input, n must be greater than 0, s is the input string, s1 is the count of '1's in s, t1 is the count of '1's in t, cnt is the total number of positions where s[i] is not equal to t[i].**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all of its iterations, the variable `cnt` will hold the total count of positions where the characters in the strings `s` and `t` differ. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `s1`, and `t1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
