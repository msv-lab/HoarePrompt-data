The code calculates the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1` and assigns it to the variable `d`. The values of `s1` and `t1` remain unchanged, and the other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is the new input string, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the new input string, `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in `t`, and `cnt` is the number of positions where `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. Additionally, `s1` is not equal to `t1`. `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.**
