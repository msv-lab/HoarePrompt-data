Output State: **`t` is a string representing the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the input string, `s1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in `t`, `cnt` is updated to `cnt + (s[i] != t[i])`, `i` is incremented by 1.**

Natural language: The variable `cnt` is updated by adding 1 to it if the characters `s[i]` and `t[i]` are not equal. The variable `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values.
