Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: A new input string.
2. **n**: An input integer from the user.
3. **s**: A new input string.
4. **s1**: The count of '1's in the string `s`.
5. **t1**: The count of '1's in the string `t`.
6. **cnt**: The number of positions where `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`.
7. **Condition**: The count of '1's in `s` (`s1`) is equal to the count of '1's in `t` (`t1`).

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(s1 if cnt else 0)
```

This statement uses a conditional expression (also known as a ternary operator) to determine what to print:
- If `cnt` is non-zero (i.e., there are positions where `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`), it prints `s1`.
- If `cnt` is zero (i.e., `s` and `t` are identical), it prints `0`.

### Key Observations:
- `s1` and `t1` are equal according to the initial state.
- `cnt` measures the number of differing positions between `s` and `t`.

### Possible Scenarios:
1. **If `cnt` is non-zero**:
   - This means `s` and `t` are not identical.
   - Since `s1` and `t1` are equal, the number of '1's in both strings is the same, but their positions differ.
   - The output will be `s1`.

2. **If `cnt` is zero**:
   - This means `s` and `t` are identical.
   - Since `s1` and `t1` are equal, both strings have the same '1's in the same positions.
   - The output will be `0`.

### Conclusion:
Given the print statement and the initial state, the output depends on the value of `cnt`. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given conditions.

### Final Output:
Output: **s1 if cnt else 0 (where s1 is the count of '1's in the string s, and cnt is the number of differing positions between s and t)**
