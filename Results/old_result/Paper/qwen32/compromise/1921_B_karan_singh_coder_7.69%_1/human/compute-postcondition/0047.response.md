The code snippet sets the variable `cnt` to 0. This change impacts the value of `cnt` only, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is the new input string, `n` is the input integer from the user, `s` is the new input string, `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in the new `t`, and `cnt` is 0.**
