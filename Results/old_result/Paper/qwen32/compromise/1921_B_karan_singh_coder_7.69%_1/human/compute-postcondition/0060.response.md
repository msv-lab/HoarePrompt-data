Postcondition: **`t` is the new input string, `n` is the input integer from the user, `s` is the new input string, `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in the new `t`, and `cnt` is the number of positions where `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`. If `s1` is equal to `t1`, then the count of '1's in `s` is equal to the count of '1's in `t`. Otherwise, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.**
