To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the provided initial state and the variables involved:

1. **t**: A string representing the input.
2. **n**: Must be greater than 0 (though `n` is not directly used in the print statement, it is part of the precondition).
3. **s**: The input string (same as `t` based on the context).
4. **s1**: The count of '1's in the string `s`.
5. **t1**: The count of '1's in the string `t` (same as `s1` since `s` and `t` are the same).
6. **cnt**: The total number of positions where `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`. Since `s` and `t` are the same, `cnt` should be 0.
7. **d**: The absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, which is `abs(s1 - t1)`. Since `s1` and `t1` are the same, `d` should be 0.

Given that `cnt` and `d` are both 0 (as explained above), we can substitute these values into the print statement:

```
print((cnt - d) // 2 + d)
```

Substituting `cnt` and `d`:

```
print((0 - 0) // 2 + 0)
```

Simplifying the expression:

```
print(0 // 2 + 0)
print(0 + 0)
print(0)
```

Thus, the output of the print statement is `0`.

Output: **0**
