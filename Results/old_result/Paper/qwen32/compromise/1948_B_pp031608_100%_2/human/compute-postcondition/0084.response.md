The given code snippet modifies the value of `arr[i - 1]` to be equal to `nums[0]`. Since `i` is 1, `arr[0]` is updated to the first element of the `nums` list.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` remains an integer and `n-2` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1).
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99.
- `m` remains an integer and `m` must be at least 2.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, with the first element (`arr[0]`) now being `nums[0]`.
- `nums` remains a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.
- `i` remains 1.
- `ans` remains unchanged unless previously set to False due to `nums` not being sorted.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer and `n-2` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an integer and `m` must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input with `arr[0]` now equal to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `i` is 1, `ans` remains unchanged.**
