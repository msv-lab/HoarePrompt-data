Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is modified if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]` if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `ans` is False if `nums` is not sorted, `i` is decreased by 1 if `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `nums` is not sorted.**
