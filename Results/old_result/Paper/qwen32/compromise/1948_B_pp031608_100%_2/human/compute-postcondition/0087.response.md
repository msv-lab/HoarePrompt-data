To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, we need to analyze the expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Understanding `ans`**: The variable `ans` is described as being either `True` or `False`. In Python, `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0` when used in a numeric context.

2. **List Indexing**: The expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]` uses `ans` to index into the list `['NO', 'YES']`. 
   - If `ans` is `True` (which is equivalent to `1`), it will index the second element of the list, resulting in `'YES'`.
   - If `ans` is `False` (which is equivalent to `0`), it will index the first element of the list, resulting in `'NO'`.

3. **Final Output**: The `print` statement will output either `'NO'` or `'YES'` based on the value of `ans`.

Given this analysis, the output can be precisely described as follows:

- If `ans` is `True`, the output will be `'YES'`.
- If `ans` is `False`, the output will be `'NO'`.

Thus, the final output is dependent on the value of `ans`.

Output: **['NO', 'YES'][ans] (where 'NO' is printed if ans is False and 'YES' is printed if ans is True)**
