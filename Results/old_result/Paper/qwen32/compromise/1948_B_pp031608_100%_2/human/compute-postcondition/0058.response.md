To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` is an integer and `n-1` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99.
- `m` is an integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers potentially modified based on the loop's condition checks.
- `ans` is a boolean value that is True if no unsorted `nums` was found, or False if an unsorted `nums` was found and caused the loop to break.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

### Analysis:
The print statement uses a list `['NO', 'YES']` and indexes it with the value of `ans`. Since `ans` is a boolean, it can only be `True` or `False`.

- If `ans` is `True`, `['NO', 'YES'][True]` evaluates to `['NO', 'YES'][1]`, which is `'YES'`.
- If `ans` is `False`, `['NO', 'YES'][False]` evaluates to `['NO', 'YES'][0]`, which is `'NO'`.

### Conclusion:
The output depends on the value of `ans`:
- If `ans` is `True`, the output will be `'YES'`.
- If `ans` is `False`, the output will be `'NO'`.

Given the precondition, `ans` is determined by whether an unsorted `nums` was found during the loop's execution. However, without knowing the specific details of the loop, we can only describe the output based on the possible values of `ans`.

### Final Output:
Output: **['NO', 'YES'][ans] (where ans is a boolean value indicating whether no unsorted nums was found (True) or an unsorted nums was found (False))**

However, to strictly adhere to the format requested:

- If `ans` is `True`, Output: **YES**
- If `ans` is `False`, Output: **NO**

Since the exact value of `ans` is not specified, we'll provide the general form:

Output: **['NO', 'YES'][ans] (where ans is a boolean value indicating whether no unsorted nums was found (True) or an unsorted nums was found (False))**

But for clarity in the format requested:

Output: **['NO', 'YES'][ans]**
