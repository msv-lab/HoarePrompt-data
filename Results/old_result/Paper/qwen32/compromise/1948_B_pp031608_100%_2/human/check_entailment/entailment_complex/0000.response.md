### Reasoning:

The given program aims to determine if it's possible to sort an array by repeatedly splitting elements greater than or equal to 10 into their individual digits and reinserting them into the array. However, the logic implemented in the code does not correctly address the problem statement. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting and Sorting**:
   - The code iterates through the array from right to left, checking if the current element is less than the previous one. If so, it attempts to split the previous element and check if the resulting array segment is sorted.
   - This approach is flawed because it doesn't consider all possible ways to split elements and reinsert them to achieve a sorted array. It only checks a specific condition and doesn't explore other potential transformations.

2. **Misinterpretation of the Problem**:
   - The problem requires determining if it's possible to transform the array into a sorted one by any sequence of operations, not just by a specific sequence of operations as checked by the code.
   - The code incorrectly assumes that splitting an element and checking if the resulting segment is sorted is sufficient to determine if the entire array can be sorted.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the second test case in the example (`12 28 5`), the code would incorrectly determine that it's impossible to sort the array. However, by splitting `28` into `2` and `8`, and then rearranging, the array can be sorted as `[2, 5, 8]`.

### Conclusion:
Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
