Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
- We need to check if we can sort an array by repeatedly splitting numbers greater than or equal to 10 into their individual digits.
- The operation can be performed any number of times.
- We need to determine if the array can be transformed into a non-decreasing order using these operations.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program iterates through each test case and checks if the array can be sorted by performing the specified operation.

#### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array elements.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It initializes a flag `ans` to `True`, assuming the array can be sorted.
   - It iterates through the array from the end to the beginning (`for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1)`).
   - If it finds an element `arr[i - 1]` that is greater than `arr[i]`, it attempts to split `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and checks if the resulting array (including `arr[i]`) can be sorted.
   - If the resulting array cannot be sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Finally, it prints "YES" if `ans` is `True` and "NO" otherwise.

#### Issues with the Program:
- The program only checks if splitting the larger number can result in a sorted array up to that point, but it does not account for the possibility of further splits affecting earlier parts of the array.
- The logic assumes that if a single split can make the local segment sorted, the entire array can be sorted, which is not necessarily true.
- The program does not handle the case where multiple splits might be required to achieve a fully sorted array.

### Example Analysis:
- For the test case `[12, 28, 5]`:
  - The program checks `28 > 5`, splits `28` into `[2, 8, 5]`, and checks if `[2, 8, 5]` is sorted, which it is not.
  - However, the correct approach would involve further splits and checks to see if the entire array can be sorted, which the program does not do.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the described operations.

**Correctness: False**
