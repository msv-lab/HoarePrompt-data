To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
2. `string` is the input string.
3. `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
4. `n` is the length of `string`.
5. `x` is the first character of `string`.
6. `j` is initialized to 2.
7. `i` is initialized to 0.

### Conditional Logic:
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to 2.
- Otherwise, `count`, `count2`, and `done` remain unchanged.

### Key Points:
- The initial state does not mention `count`, `count2`, or `done`. Therefore, we assume these variables are not relevant to the output of the `print` statement.
- The `print('YES')` statement is not conditional and will execute regardless of the values of `s[j]`, `x`, `count`, `count2`, or `done`.

### Conclusion:
Since the `print('YES')` statement is unconditional, it will always print "YES" regardless of the input string or the values of the variables.

Output: **YES**
