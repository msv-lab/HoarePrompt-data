The provided initial state describes a series of variables and their relationships, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is simply `print('YES')`. This means that the output of the `print` statement is not dependent on the values of the variables `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `count`, `count2`, `done`, `j`, or `i`. The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'` exactly as it is written.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
