`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. After the code execution, `t` will hold the integer value provided by the input. The precondition for `s` in the test cases remains valid but is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by the input, such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; for each of the `t` test cases, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with a length such that 1 <= |`s`| <= 10^6. The sum of the lengths of all strings `s` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**
