The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, in the provided code snippet, there is no loop structure. Therefore, the `continue` statement does not affect the flow or the values of any variables.

Given that the `continue` statement has no impact on the variables or the state, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `done` is `False`; `x` is the first character of `string`, and `x` is not equal to the last character of `string`.**
