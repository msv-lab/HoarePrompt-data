Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `x` is the first character of `string`; `j` is 2; `i` is 0; `done` is True; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain unchanged from the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
