Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `string` is the value of the input and has at least 1 character.
3. `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
4. `n` is the length of `string` and is greater than 0.
5. `done` is `True` if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` (i.e., if the string is not a palindrome), otherwise `done` remains `False`.
6. `x` is the first character of `string`.
7. If the count of `x` in `s` equals `n`, then every character in `s` is `x`.
8. If the count of `x` in `s` is `n - 1`, then either `n` is even, or if `n` is odd, the character at the middle index `(n - 1) // 2` in `s` is `x`.
9. `count` is greater than 1.
10. `count2` is 0.
11. `j` is 0.
12. `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` remains 0.
13. `count2` is not less than `count`.
14. `count2` equals `count`.
15. `count` is greater than 1.

### Key Observations:
- Given that `j` is 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, it means the first character of the string (`s[0]`) is not equal to `x`. However, `x` is defined as the first character of the string, so there seems to be a contradiction here. Let's re-evaluate the conditions:
  - Since `j` is 0 and `s[j]` (i.e., `s[0]`) is not equal to `x`, it implies `x` must be the first character of the string, but the condition `s[j] != x` must be met for some `j` other than 0.
  - The condition `count` is greater than 1 suggests that there are multiple occurrences of some character(s) in the string.
  - `count2` equals `count` and `count2` is not less than `count`, which is consistent with `count` being greater than 1.

### Print Statement:
```
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```
- `j` is 0, so `j - 1` is -1.
- `string[:j - 1]` is `string[:-1]`, which is the string excluding the last character.
- `string[j - 1:]` is `string[-1:]`, which is the last character of the string.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string excluding the last character, followed by the last character of the string.

### Final Output:
Output: **string[:-1] string[-1:]** (where `string[:-1]` is the string excluding the last character and `string[-1:]` is the last character of the string)
