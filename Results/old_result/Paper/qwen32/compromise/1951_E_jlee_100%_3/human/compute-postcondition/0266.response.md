Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `x` is the first character of `string`; `j` is 2; `i` is 0; `count` is 2; `count2` and `done` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified in this code snippet, all the variables retain their initial values.
