Postcondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; string is the value of the input; s is a list of characters from string; n is the length of string; x is the first character of string. If the count of x in s equals n, then every character in s is x. Otherwise, the count of x in s is not equal to n. If the count of x in s is n - 1, then either n is even, or if n is odd, the character at the middle index (n - 1) // 2 in s is x. count is 0 or a value indicating the first non-x character; count2 is 0 or a value indicating the number of x characters after count; done is False; j is n (indicating all iterations are completed). The condition (not done) is True, meaning the loop or process associated with done has not yet completed.**
