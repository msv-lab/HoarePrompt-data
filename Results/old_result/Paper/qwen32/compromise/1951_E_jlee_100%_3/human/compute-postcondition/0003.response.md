The code snippet converts the `string` into a list of characters and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `t` and `string` remain unchanged. The output state reflects these changes.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`.**
