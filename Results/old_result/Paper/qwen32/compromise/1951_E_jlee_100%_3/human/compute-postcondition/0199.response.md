Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `x` is the first character of `string`; `count` is greater than 0; `count2` is equal to `count`; `j` is 0; `i` is 0. The character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to `x`. Additionally, `count2` is not less than `count` and `count2` is equal to `count`.**
