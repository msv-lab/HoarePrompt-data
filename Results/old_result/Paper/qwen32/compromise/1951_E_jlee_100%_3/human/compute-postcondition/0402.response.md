Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the new value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is the length of the new `string` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `j` is 1. If `count` is greater than 0, the following conditions apply: If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True, and the loop breaks. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is set to True and the loop breaks. If `count2` equals `count` and `count` was initially less than 1, `count` is set to 1. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True and the loop breaks. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count2` and `done` remain unchanged. If `count` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to the variables.**
