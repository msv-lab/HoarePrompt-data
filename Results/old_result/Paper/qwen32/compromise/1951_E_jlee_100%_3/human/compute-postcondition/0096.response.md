The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print(2)
```

This statement directly prints the integer `2` to the output. The initial state and the conditions described do not affect the value being printed by this statement. The variables `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `count`, and `done` are all defined in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **2**
