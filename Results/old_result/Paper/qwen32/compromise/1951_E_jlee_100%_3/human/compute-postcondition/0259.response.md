Let's analyze the given initial state and code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `string` is the value of the input.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `string`.
- `x` is the first character of `string`.
- `j` is 2.
- `i` is 0.
- If `count` is greater than 0, then `count2` is less than or equal to `count` and `done` is True.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is True.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is equal to `count`, `done` is True if `count` is greater than 1, and `count2` is set to 0 if `count` is not greater than 1.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True.
- If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1.
- If `count` is not greater than 0, the values of `count2` and `done` remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward. It simply prints the string `'YES'` to the console. The values of variables `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `i`, `count`, `count2`, and `done` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it is not using any of these variables in the print statement.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
