Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `string` is the value of the input.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `string`.
- `x` is the first character of `string`.
- `j` is 2.
- `i` is 0.
- The conditions involving `count`, `count2`, and `done` are described, but `count` is not explicitly initialized or used in the provided code snippet.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The provided code snippet contains only a single `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. This print statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. Therefore, the value to be printed is straightforward.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
