Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`t`**: An integer between 1 and 10,000 (inclusive). This variable does not affect the print statement directly.

2. **`string`**: A non-empty string (at least 1 character).

3. **`s`**: A list of characters extracted from `string`.

4. **`n`**: The length of `string` (greater than 0).

5. **`done`**: A boolean variable initialized to `False`.

6. **`x`**: The first character of `string`.

7. **Character Count Conditions**:
   - If the count of `x` in `s` equals `n`, then every character in `s` is `x`.
   - If the count of `x` in `s` is `n - 1`, then:
     - Either `n` is even.
     - Or if `n` is odd, the character at the middle index `(n - 1) // 2` in `s` is `x`.
   - Otherwise, the count of `x` in `s` is not equal to `n` or `n - 1`.

8. **`count`**: Initialized to 0.

9. **`count2`**: Initialized to 0.

10. **`j`**: Initialized to 0.

11. **Character Comparison Condition**:
    - `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:

The given print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions mentioned in the initial state. 

### Final Output:

The print statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
