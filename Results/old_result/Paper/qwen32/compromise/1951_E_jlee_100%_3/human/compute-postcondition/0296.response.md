Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `x` is the first character of `string`; `count` is the index of the first character not equal to `x`; `count2` is the count of characters equal to `x` after `count`; `done` is False; `j` is `n` (indicating all iterations are completed); `i` is 0; and `done` remains False.**

Since the `if not done` condition is always true given the precondition that `done` is False, the else part does not execute, and the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
