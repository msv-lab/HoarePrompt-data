Let's break down the given information and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable does not affect the print statement directly.
2. **`string`**: The new value of the input, which is a string.
3. **`s`**: A list of characters from the new `string`.
4. **`n`**: The length of the new `string` and must be at least 1.
5. **`x`**: The first character of the new `string`.
6. **`count`**: Greater than 0.
7. **`count2`**: Less than `count`.
8. **`j`**: Initially set to 0.
9. **`s[j]`**: Not equal to `x` for the current value of `j`.
10. **`done`**: Initially False, can be set to True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.

### Conditions:
- If `x != s[-1]`, the first character `x` is not equal to the last character of the `string`.
- If `s.count(x) == n`, all characters in `s` are equal to `x`.
- If `s.count(x) == n - 1`, `n` is odd and the middle character `s[(n - 1) // 2]` is not equal to `x`.
- The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

### Explanation:
- **`string[:j]`**: This part of the string includes characters from the beginning up to, but not including, the index `j`. Since `j` is initially set to 0, `string[:j]` will be an empty string.
- **`string[j:]`**: This part of the string includes characters from the index `j` to the end of the string. Since `j` is initially set to 0, `string[j:]` will be the entire `string`.

Given that `j` is 0 and `s[j]` (i.e., `string[0]`) is not equal to `x` (which is also `string[0]`), this condition seems contradictory based on the given information. However, the problem states that `s[j]` is not equal to `x` for the current value of `j`, which means `j` is not 0 in the context where this condition is checked. But since `j` is initially 0, we proceed with that initial value.

### Output:
Since `j` is 0, `string[:j]` is an empty string and `string[j:]` is the entire `string`.

Output: ** (empty string), string (where string is the entire input string)**

However, for the sake of precise formatting as per the instructions, we can write it as:

Output: **, string (where string is the entire input string)**
