Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's break down the information and determine what will be printed.

**Initial State:**
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `string` is the value of the input.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `string`.
- `x` is the first character of `string`.
- `count` is greater than 0.
- `count2` is less than `count`.
- `j` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- The character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to `x`.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
print(2)
```

The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the integer `2`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **2**
