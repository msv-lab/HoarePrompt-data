Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `string` is the value of the input and has at least 1 character.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `string` and is greater than 0.
- `x` is the first character of `string`.
- If the count of `x` in `s` equals `n`, then every character in `s` is `x`.
- If the count of `x` in `s` is `n - 1`, then either `n` is even, or if `n` is odd, the character at the middle index `(n - 1) // 2` in `s` is `x`.
- `j` is 2.
- If `s[j] != x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2.
- If `s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to `True`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `done`.

### Code Analysis:
The code snippet provided is:
```python
print('YES')
```

The `print('YES')` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `count`, or `done`. The conditions described in the initial state do not affect the execution of the `print` statement.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
