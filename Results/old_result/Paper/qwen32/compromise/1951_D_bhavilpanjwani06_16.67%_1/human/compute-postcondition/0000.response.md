The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers between 1 and \(10^{18}\).

After the code execution, the values of `n` and `k` are set to the integers provided by the input. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}.**
