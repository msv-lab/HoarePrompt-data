Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- The current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`.

From the initial state, we know that `n` and `k` are equal at the time of the print statement, and `n` is the value that will be printed.

Let's break down the print statement:
```
print(n)
```

Since `n` is equal to `k`, and no operations are performed to change `n` before the print statement, the value printed will be the value of `n` (or equivalently `k`).

Output: **n (where n is equal to k)**
