The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`. The string 'YES' is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.

Based on the initial state, we have:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}.
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- The current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will simply be the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
