### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to find the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two non-empty piles and reading the book with the highest number of pages in each pile. The optimal strategy to achieve this is to pick the two books with the highest number of pages, as these will always yield the maximum sum when divided into two piles.

The provided program correctly implements this strategy:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `nums`.
3. It sorts the list of pages in descending order.
4. It prints the sum of the first two elements in the sorted list, which correspond to the two books with the highest number of pages.

Since the program correctly identifies and sums the two largest values from the list of pages for each test case, it will always produce the correct result.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
