In the given task, the for loop's execution depends on the value provided by the user input, which is then converted to an integer. The loop will execute based on this integer value. The loop head contains the underscore `_` and the result of `int(input())`. Since the underscore `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's execution, the only variable we need to consider is the result of `int(input())`.

For the loop to execute, the integer value obtained from `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input provided to the `int(input())` function will result in a positive integer.

State: **The input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than 0**.
