The code snippet provided initializes a variable `ans` to `-1`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, or `S`. The initial state of `n` being the input integer, `a` being the input string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', and `S` being `[[0, 0], [count_0, count_1]]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `S` is `[[0, 0], [count_0, count_1]]`, `ans` is `-1`.**
