The code snippet `count += 1` increments the value of the variable `count` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify a value for `count`, we can only say that it is increased by 1. Other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `j`, `k`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters where each character is a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 2, `j` is 0, `k` is `k + 1`, `count` is increased by 1.**
