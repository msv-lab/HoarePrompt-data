The only variables in the loop head are `k` and `n - j`. Therefore, we can only adjust those variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `s` is a list of characters where each character is a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 2.
- `j` is 0.
- `k` is `k + 1`.

From the loop statement `for k in range(0, n - j):`, we know that `k` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. Since `j` is 0, the loop runs from `k = 0` to `k = n - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `k` was incremented by 1, so at the start of the next iteration, `k` will be `k + 1`.

Since `j` is 0 and does not change, the upper bound of the loop `n - j` remains `n`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `k` incremented by 1 and `j` remains 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters where each character is a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 2, `j` is 0, `k` is `k + 1`**
