Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters where each character is a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 2, `count` is 1, `j` is 0, and either `s[k]` is a question mark, or `s[k + j]` is a question mark, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `j`) retain their initial values and conditions.
