You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s , consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or
question marks.

A tandem repeat is a string of an even length such that its first half is
equal to its second half.

A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by the
deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and
several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

Your goal is to replace each question mark with some lowercase Latin letter in
such a way that the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat is
maximum possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The only line of each testcase contains a string s (1 \le |s| \le 5000 ),
consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.

The total length of the strings over all testcases doesn't exceed 5000 .

Output

For each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum length of the longest
substring that is a tandem repeat after you replace each question mark in the
string with some lowercase Latin letter.

If it's impossible to make any tandem repeat substrings in the string, print 0
.

Example

Input

    4
    
    zaabaabz
    
    ?????
    
    code?????s
    
    codeforces

Output

    6
    4
    10
    0

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
    print(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a string of characters from the input, checks for the longest palindromic subsequence that can be formed by considering '?' as a wildcard, and prints the length of this subsequence if found. If no such subsequence is found, it prints 0. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it does not replace question marks in an optimal way to maximize the length of the longest tandem repeat substring. The program only checks if a substring can be a tandem repeat by allowing question marks to act as wildcards but does not actually replace them with specific characters to ensure the maximum possible tandem repeat length.

Here is a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
a????a
```

**Expected Output:**
```
6
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0
```

**Explanation of the Counterexample:**
The program should replace the question marks in such a way that the entire string becomes a tandem repeat. For the input "a????a", the optimal replacement would be "aaabba" or "aabbba" or any other string where the first half matches the second half, making the entire string a tandem repeat of length 6. However, the program does not perform any replacements and incorrectly concludes that no tandem repeat can be formed.

To fix the program, it should actually replace question marks with specific characters to maximize the tandem repeat length, not just check if a substring can be a tandem repeat with the presence of question marks.
