Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Logic for Counting Tandem Repeats**: The program checks if characters at positions `k` and `k + j` are the same or if either is a question mark. However, it does not replace question marks with letters that would potentially create a tandem repeat. The logic should be more sophisticated to consider possible replacements of question marks to maximize the tandem repeat length.

2. **Handling Question Marks**: The program does not attempt to replace question marks with any specific letters to maximize the tandem repeat length. It only checks if the characters are the same or if one of them is a question mark, which is not sufficient to ensure the maximum possible tandem repeat.

3. **Output for Each Testcase**: The program correctly prints the result for each testcase, but the result itself is incorrect due to the flawed logic.

To fix the program, a more complex approach is needed, such as using dynamic programming or a greedy strategy to replace question marks in a way that maximizes the length of the longest tandem repeat substring.
