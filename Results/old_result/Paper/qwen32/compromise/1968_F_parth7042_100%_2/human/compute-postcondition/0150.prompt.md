Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer value of `data[0]` decremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and the subsequent `n` elements are the integer values of `data[index]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `index + n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and the subsequent `n` elements are the cumulative XOR of `a[j]` for `j` from 1 to `i`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list of indices `i` where the cumulative XOR up to `i` is `pf[i]`; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[index])
    r = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp[pf[r]]
    v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
    it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer value of `data[0]` decremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`; `q` is an integer value of `data[index - 1]` and must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and the subsequent `n` elements are the integer values of `data[index - 2]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `index + 2`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and the subsequent `n` elements are the cumulative XOR of `a[j]` for `j` from 1 to `i`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list of indices `i` where the cumulative XOR up to `i` is `pf[i]`; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO', and the last element of `results` is 'YES' if `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, otherwise it is 'NO'; `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `r` is equal to `q`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is the list of indices `i` where the cumulative XOR up to `i` is `pf[r]`; `v2` is the list of indices `i` where the cumulative XOR up to `i` is `pf[l - 1]`; `it1` is the insertion point of `l` in `v1` found using `bisect_left`; `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer value of `data[0]` decremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`; `q` is an integer value of `data[index - 1]` and must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and the subsequent `n` elements are the integer values of `data[index - 2]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `index + 4`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and the subsequent `n` elements are the cumulative XOR of `a[j]` for `j` from 1 to `i`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list of indices `i` where the cumulative XOR up to `i` is `pf[i]`; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO'. The last element of `results` is 'YES' if `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, otherwise it is 'NO'. `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is the list of indices `i` where the cumulative XOR up to `i` is `pf[r]`; `v2` is the list of indices `i` where the cumulative XOR up to `i` is `pf[l - 1]` (updated from `mp[pf[l - 1]]`); `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`; `q` is `q + 1`; `it1` is the insertion point of `l` in `v1` found using `bisect_left`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer value of `data[0]` decremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]`; `q` is an integer value of `data[index - 3]` and must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and the subsequent `n` elements are the integer values of `data[index - 4]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `index + 6`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and the subsequent `n` elements are the cumulative XOR of `a[j]` for `j` from 1 to `i`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list of indices `i` where the cumulative XOR up to `i` is `pf[i]`; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO', with the last element being 'YES' if `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, otherwise it is 'NO'; `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 3]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is the list of indices `i` where the cumulative XOR up to `i` is `pf[r]`; `v2` is the list of indices `i` where the cumulative XOR up to `i` is `pf[l - 1]` (reassigned to `mp[pf[l - 1]]`); `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`; `q` is `q - 1`; `it1` is the insertion point of `l` in `v1` found using `bisect_left`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
