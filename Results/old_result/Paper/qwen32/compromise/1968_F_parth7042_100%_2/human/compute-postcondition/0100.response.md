The code snippet `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list associated with the key `pf[i]` in the defaultdict `mp`.

Given the initial state, `mp[pf[i]]` already contains either `[0, i]` or `[i]` (depending on whether `pf[i]` was `0` before or not). After executing the code, `i` is appended to this list.

Since `i` is `n`, `mp[pf[i]]` will now contain `[0, i, i]` if `pf[i]` was `0` before, or `[i, i]` if `pf[i]` was not `0` before. However, it's important to note that since `pf[i]` is not `0` (as `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` and `a[i]` is `int(data[index])` which is at least `1`), `mp[pf[i]]` will contain `[i, i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value of `data[0]` and must be at least 0, decremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` and must be at least 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is a list of `n + 2` elements where the first `n + 1` elements are zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[index])` and `a[n + 1]` is also `int(data[index])`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `8 + 2 * n + 1`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[pf[i]]` now contains `[i, i]`; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO'; `i` is `n`.**
