The code snippet `a[i] = int(data[index])` updates the value of `a[i]` to the integer value of `data[index]`. Since `i` is 2 and `index` is 4, `a[2]` is set to the integer value of `data[4]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value of `data[0]` and must be at least 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[0]` is 0, `a[1]` is 0, `a[2]` is `int(data[4])`, and all other elements are 0; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 4; `results` is an empty list; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` for the specific `i`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list of indices where `pf` has the value `pf[i]`, including the newly appended `i`; `i` is 2.**
