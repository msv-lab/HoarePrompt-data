Output State: **`t` is an integer value of `data[0]` and must be at least 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` such that `q` is at least 1; `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is `int(data[3 + i - 1])` and all other elements are 0; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `5 + n`; `results` is a list containing the string 'YES' if `x` equals 0, otherwise `results` contains the string 'NO'; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of `a[j]` for `j` from 1 to `i` and all other elements are 0; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list of indices where `pf` has the value `pf[i]`; `l` is the integer value of `data[3 + n]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[4 + n]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is the list of indices where `pf` has the value `pf[r]`; `v2` is the list of indices where `pf` has the value `pf[l - 1]`; `it1` is the insertion index of `l` in `v1` to maintain sorted order; `it2` is the insertion index of `r` in `v2` to maintain sorted order minus 1; either `it1` is not less than the length of `v1`, or `it2` is less than 0, or `v1[it1]` is not less than `v2[it2]`**

In this output state, the only change is that the string 'NO' has been appended to the `results` list. All other variables retain their initial values.
