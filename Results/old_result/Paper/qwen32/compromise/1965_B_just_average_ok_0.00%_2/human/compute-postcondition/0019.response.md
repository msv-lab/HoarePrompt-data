The code snippet provided takes two integer inputs and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` is the first integer from the input and `k` is less than 16777216. The values of `t`, `nums`, and `idx` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is a list of integers [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, `k - 4194304`, `k + 1`, `k + 4194305`], `idx` is 23.**
