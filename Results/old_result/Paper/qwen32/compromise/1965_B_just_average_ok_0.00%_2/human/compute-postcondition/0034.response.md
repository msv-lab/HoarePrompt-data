Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
2. `n` is the first integer from the input.
3. `k` is the second integer from the input.
4. `nums` is a list constructed as follows:
   - It starts with the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]`.
   - It includes `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2`.
   - The element `1 << idx` is removed from the list.

### Task:
Determine the length of the list `nums` after the construction.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial List Construction**:
   - The initial list `nums` contains 25 elements: powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\).

2. **Additional Elements**:
   - `k - nums[idx]`: This depends on the value of `k` and `idx`.
   - `k + 1`: This is simply `k` plus one.
   - `k + 2`: This is simply `k` plus two.

3. **Element Removal**:
   - The element `1 << idx` is removed from the list. Since `1 << idx` is equivalent to \(2^{idx}\), this means one of the initial 25 elements (powers of 2) is removed.

4. **Final List Length**:
   - We start with 25 elements.
   - We add 3 more elements (`k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, `k + 2`).
   - We remove 1 element (`1 << idx`).

Thus, the final length of the list `nums` is:
\[ 25 + 3 - 1 = 27 \]

### Conclusion:
The `print(len(nums))` statement will output the length of the list `nums` after the described construction and removal.

Output: **27**
