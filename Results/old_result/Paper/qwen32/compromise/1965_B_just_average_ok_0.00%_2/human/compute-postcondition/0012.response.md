The code snippet appends the value of `k - nums[idx]` to the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is 23, the value `nums[23]` is 4194304. Therefore, the new element appended to `nums` is `k - 4194304`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is less than 16777216, `nums` is a list of integers [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, `k - 4194304`], `idx` is 23.**
