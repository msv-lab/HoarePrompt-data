The given code snippet removes the element `1 << idx` from the list `nums`. Here, `1 << idx` is equivalent to `2^idx`. 

Given that `idx` is the largest integer such that `2^idx <= k` and `idx <= 24`, the element `2^idx` will be removed from the list `nums`.

Let's determine the new state of `nums` after the removal:

- `nums` initially contains the powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^24`, along with some additional elements: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
- The element `2^idx` will be removed from this list.

Since `idx` is the largest integer such that `2^idx <= k`, the element `2^idx` is the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.

After the removal, `nums` will no longer contain `2^idx`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, `k + nums[idx] + 1`] with `2^idx` removed; `idx` is the largest integer such that 2^idx <= k and idx <= 24, decremented by 1.**
