To determine the output, we need to carefully understand how the variables are defined and how the `nums` list is constructed based on the given initial state.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initialization of `nums`**:
   - `nums` is initialized as a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{24}\).
   - Additionally, the following elements are included in `nums`:
     - `k - nums[idx]`
     - `k + 1`
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`
   - However, `2^idx` is removed from the list, where `idx` is the largest integer such that \(2^{idx} \leq k\) and \(idx \leq 24\).

2. **Determine `idx`**:
   - `idx` is the largest integer such that \(2^{idx} \leq k\).
   - This means that `2^{idx}` is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.

3. **Constructing `nums`**:
   - Start with the list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{24}\).
   - Identify `2^{idx}` and remove it from the list.
   - Insert the elements `k - 2^{idx}`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^{idx} + 1` into the list.

### Example Calculation:

Let's assume `k = 10` for illustration:
- The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 10 is \(2^3 = 8\), so `idx = 3`.
- The list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{24}\) is: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]`.
- Remove `2^3 = 8` from the list.
- Insert `k - 2^{idx} = 10 - 8 = 2`, `k + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11`, and `k + 2^{idx} + 1 = 10 + 8 + 1 = 19` into the list.
- The final `nums` list will be: `[1, 2, 4, 2, 11, 19, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]`.

### General Case:

For a general `k`, the `nums` list will be constructed similarly:
- Start with the list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{24}\).
- Remove `2^{idx}`.
- Insert `k - 2^{idx}`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^{idx} + 1`.

### Output:

The `print(*nums)` statement will print all elements of the `nums` list.

Output: **1, 2, 4, ..., 8388608, k - 2^{idx}, k + 1, k + 2^{idx} + 1 (where idx is the largest integer such that 2^{idx} <= k and idx <= 24, and 2^{idx} is removed from the list)**
