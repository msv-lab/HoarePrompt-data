The only variable in the loop head is the loop variable `_`, which is not explicitly used within the loop body. The loop runs for a number of times determined by the integer input `n`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop variable `_` and the input `n` are involved.

Given:
- The loop runs for `n` iterations.
- The loop variable `_` is not used within the loop body, so its value does not matter for the loop's execution.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `idx` is 23, but `idx` is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.

Since the loop runs for `n` iterations, the loop will execute one more time if `n` is greater than the number of iterations that have already completed. The loop variable `_` does not need to be adjusted because it is not used in the loop body.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is less than 16777216, `nums` is a list of integers [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, `k - 4194304`, `k + 1`, `k + 4194305`], `idx` is 23**
