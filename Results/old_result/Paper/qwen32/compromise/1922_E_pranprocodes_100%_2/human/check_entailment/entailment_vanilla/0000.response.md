Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Recap
The task is to generate an array of integers such that the number of its increasing subsequences is exactly the given integer \( X \). If no such array exists, the program should output -1. The array length should be at most 200, and all elements should be within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

### Analysis of the Given Program
The program attempts to generate the required array by iterating through the input value \( X \) and constructing the array based on whether \( X \) is even or odd. Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `max` and `min` are initialized to \( 100,000,000 \) and \( -100,000,000 \) respectively.
   - `ans` is an empty list that will store the resulting array.
   - `t` is initialized to 0 and will keep track of the length of the array.

2. **Loop Until \( X \) Becomes 1**:
   - If \( X \) is even, it appends the current `max` value to `ans`, decrements `max`, and divides `X` by 2.
   - If \( X \) is odd, it appends the current `min` value to `ans`, increments `min`, and decrements `X` by 1.
   - `t` is incremented in each iteration to keep track of the number of elements added to `ans`.

3. **Reverse the Array**:
   - After the loop, the array `ans` is reversed before being printed.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the array and the array itself.

### Correctness Analysis
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible values of \( X \). Here are the key issues:

1. **Subsequence Counting**:
   - The program attempts to generate an array such that the number of increasing subsequences is \( X \). However, the method used (appending `max` or `min` based on the parity of \( X \)) does not guarantee the correct number of increasing subsequences.
   - For example, the number of increasing subsequences in an array depends on the specific arrangement of elements, not just the number of times `max` and `min` are used.

2. **Handling Large \( X \)**:
   - The problem specifies that \( X \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \). The program's approach does not scale well for such large values because it relies on repeatedly dividing \( X \) by 2, which would take a very large number of iterations.

3. **Array Length Constraint**:
   - The problem requires the array length to be at most 200. The current approach does not ensure that the array length constraint is met for all possible \( X \).

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not guarantee the correct number of increasing subsequences for all possible values of \( X \) and does not handle the array length constraint effectively.

**Correctness: False**
