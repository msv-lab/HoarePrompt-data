The code snippet provided updates the value of `x` by performing integer division by 2. This means `x` will be halved and rounded down to the nearest whole number.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is 2
- `x` is any integer except 1
- `max` is either 99999997, 99999998, or 99999999
- `min` is either -99999999 or -99999998
- `ans` is either [100000000, max, max], [-100000000, max, max], [100000000, min, max], or [-100000000, min, max]
- `i` is `i + 1`

The only variable that changes is `x`, which is now `x // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is `x // 2`, `max` is either 99999997, 99999998, or 99999999, `min` is either -99999999 or -99999998, `ans` is either [100000000, max, max], [-100000000, max, max], [100000000, min, max], or [-100000000, min, max], and `i` is `i + 1`.**
