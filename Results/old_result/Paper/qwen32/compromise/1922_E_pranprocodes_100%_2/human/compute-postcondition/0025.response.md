Output State: **`t` is 2; `x` is an input integer that has been modified based on its parity and is not equal to 1. If the original `x` was even, `x` is now `x / 2`, `max` is 99999998`, `min` is -99999999`, and `ans` is [100000000, 99999999]. If the original `x` was odd, `x` is now `x - 1`, `max` is 100000000`, `min` is -99999998`, and `ans` is [-100000000, -99999999].**

In simpler terms, the variable `t` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables (`x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans`) retain their values as described based on the original parity of `x`.
