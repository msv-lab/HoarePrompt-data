To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the role of the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: Total number of iterations.
- `x`: Starts at 1 and presumably changes in each iteration.
- `max`: Reduced by the number of even `x` encountered.
- `min`: Incremented by the number of odd `x` encountered.
- `ans`: A list of values appended during each iteration in reverse order.

### Analysis:
- The `ans` list is populated with values during the iterations, and these values are appended in reverse order. This means that the last value appended will be the first to be printed.
- The `*ans` in the `print` statement unpacks the list `ans` and prints each element separated by a space.
- Since the exact values of `x` and the number of iterations `t` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values that will be in `ans`. However, we know the structure and the order of the list.

### Conclusion:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list in the order they were appended, which is in reverse of the order of iterations. Since the exact values are not provided, we can't specify them, but we know they will be printed in the correct order.

Output: **elements of ans in the order they were appended (in reverse order of iterations)**
