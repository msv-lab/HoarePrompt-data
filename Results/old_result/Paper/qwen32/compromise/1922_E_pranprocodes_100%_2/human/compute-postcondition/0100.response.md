The code snippet increments the value of `min` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the specific value of `x` is not given, we will keep the conditions based on whether `x` is even or odd.

If `x` is even:
- `max` is 99999999
- `min` is -99999999 and after the increment, `min` becomes -99999998
- `ans` is `[100000000, -99999999]`

If `x` is odd:
- `max` is 100000000
- `min` is -100000000 and after the increment, `min` becomes -99999999
- `ans` is `[-100000000, -100000000]`

`t` is 1, `x` is not equal to 1, and `i` is `i` + 1. The variable `i` is incremented, but since its initial value is not specified, we just denote it as `i` + 1.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is not equal to 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999998 if `x` is even, otherwise `min` is -99999999, `ans` is `[100000000, -99999999]` if `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is `[-100000000, -100000000]`, and `i` is `i` + 1**.
