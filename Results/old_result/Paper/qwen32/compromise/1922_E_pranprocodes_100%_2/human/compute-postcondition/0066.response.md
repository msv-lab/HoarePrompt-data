The code appends the value of `max` to the list `ans`. The values of `t`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `i` remain unchanged. The list `ans` now includes an additional element, which is the value of `max`.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is any integer except 1, `max` is either 99999998, 99999999, or 100000000, `min` is either -99999999 or -99999998, `ans` is either [100000000, max, max], [-100000000, max, max], [100000000, min, max], or [-100000000, min, max], and `i` is `i + 1`**.
