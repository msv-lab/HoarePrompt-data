The code snippet divides the value of `x` by 2 using integer division. Given the initial state, `x` is an input integer and not equal to 1. The value of `x` will be updated to `x // 2`.

The conditions regarding `max`, `min`, and `ans` are based on whether `x` was initially even or odd. Since the code does not change these conditions, they remain as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is 1; `x` is an input integer divided by 2 and not equal to 1. If the original `x` was even, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is [100000000, 99999999]. If the original `x` was odd, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is [-100000000, 100000000].**
