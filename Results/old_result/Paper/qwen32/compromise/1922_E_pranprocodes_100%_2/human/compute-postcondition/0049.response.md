Output State: **`t` is 0, `x` is any even integer except 1, divided by 2, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [100000000], `i` is `i + 1`.**

Natural language: The value of `x` has been updated to be half of its original value, which remains an even integer (since the original `x` was an even integer). All other variables retain their initial values.
