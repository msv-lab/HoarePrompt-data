The code snippet `ans.append(min)` appends the value of `min` to the list `ans`. Given that `min` is -100000000, `ans` will now contain this value. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `max`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `x` is any integer except 1 and `x` is odd, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [-100000000], `i` is `i + 1`**
