Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 0, `x` is the input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list, and `i` is `i` + 1.
Code of the loop:
while x != 1:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        ans.append(max)
        max -= 1
        x = x // 2
    else:
        ans.append(min)
        min += 1
        x -= 1
    t += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1, `x` is not equal to 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999 if `x` is odd, otherwise `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [100000000] if `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000], and `i` is `i` + 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is 2, `x` is either `x // 2` if `x` was even, or `x - 1` if `x` was odd, `max` is 99999998 if `x` (after modification) is even, 99999999 if `x` (before modification) was odd, 100000000 if `x` (before modification) was even, `min` is -99999999 if `x` (after modification) is odd, -99999998 if `x` (before modification) was even, -100000000 if `x` (before modification) was odd, `ans` is [100000000, 99999999] if `x` was even, [100000000, -99999999] if `x` was odd and `x` (before modification) was even, [-100000000, 100000000] if `x` was even and `x` (before modification) was odd, [-100000000, -100000000] if `x` was odd and `x` (before modification) was odd, and `i` is `i` + 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is 3, `x` is greater than 1 and is either `x // 2` if `x` was even or remains unchanged if `x` was odd, `max` is 99999997, 99999998, 99999999, or 99999998 based on the parity of `x` before and after modification, `min` is -99999999, -99999998, -100000000, or -99999997 based on the parity of `x` before and after modification, `ans` is one of the following: [100000000, 99999999, 100000000], [100000000, -99999999, 100000000], [-100000000, 100000000, 100000000], [-100000000, -100000000, 100000000], [100000000, 99999999, 99999999], [100000000, -99999999, 99999999], [-100000000, 100000000, 99999999], [100000000, -99999999, -99999999], [100000000, 99999999, -99999998], and `i` is `i` + 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
