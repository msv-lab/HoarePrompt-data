Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 0, `x` is the input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is `i + 1`.
Code of the loop:
while x != 1:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        ans.append(max)
        max -= 1
        x = x // 2
    else:
        ans.append(min)
        min += 1
        x -= 1
    t += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1, `x` is any integer except 1, `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is either [100000000] or [-100000000], and `i` is `i + 1`. If `x` is even, `max` becomes 99999999 and `ans` becomes [100000000]. Otherwise, `min` becomes -99999999 and `ans` becomes [-100000000].
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is 2, `x` is any integer except 1, `max` is either 99999998, 99999999, or 100000000, `min` is either -99999999 or -99999998, `ans` is either [100000000, max], [-100000000, max], [100000000, min], or [-100000000, min], and `i` is `i + 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is 3, `x` is either `x // 2` if `x` is even or any integer except 0 or 1 if `x` is odd, `max` is either 99999997, 99999998, or 99999999, `min` is either -99999999, -99999998, or -99999997, `ans` is either [100000000, max, max], [-100000000, max, max], [100000000, min, max], [-100000000, min, max], [100000000, max, min], [-100000000, max, min], [100000000, min, min], or [-100000000, min, min], and `i` is `i + 1`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
