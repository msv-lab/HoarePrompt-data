Output State: **`t` is 2; `x` is an input integer that has been modified based on its parity and is not equal to 1; if the original `x` was even, `x` is now `x / 2`, `max` is 99999997`, `min` is -99999999`, and `ans` is [100000000, 99999999, 99999998]; if the original `x` was odd, `x` is now `x - 1`, `max` is 99999999`, `min` is -99999998`, and `ans` is [-100000000, -99999999, 100000000]**.

In simpler terms, the value of `max` has decreased by 1. If the original `x` was even, `max` is now 99999997. If the original `x` was odd, `max` remains 99999999. All other variables remain unchanged.
