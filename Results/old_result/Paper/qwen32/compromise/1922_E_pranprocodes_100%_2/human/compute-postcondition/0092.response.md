The value of `x` is decremented by 1. Given that `x` is initially an odd number and not equal to 1, after decrementing, `x` will still be an odd number and not equal to 1. The other variables (`t`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `x` is an odd number not equal to 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is [-100000000], and `i` is `i` + 1**.
