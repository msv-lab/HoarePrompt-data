Output State: **`t` is 3, `x` is either `x // 2` if `x` is even or any integer except 0 or 1 if `x` is odd, `max` is either 99999997, 99999998, or 99999999, `min` is either -99999999, -99999998, or -99999997, `ans` is either [100000000, max, max], [-100000000, max, max], [100000000, min, max], [-100000000, min, max], [100000000, max, min], [-100000000, max, min], [100000000, min, min], or [-100000000, min, min], and `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simple terms, the value of `t` has been incremented by 1, making it 3. The values of `x`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
