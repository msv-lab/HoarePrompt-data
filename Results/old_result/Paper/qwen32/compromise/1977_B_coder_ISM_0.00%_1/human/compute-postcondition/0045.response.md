Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list of 30 characters where `s[4]` remains `'0'` if `flag` is 1 and `s[4]` is `'0'`, otherwise `s` is updated such that each element is either `'1'` if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or `'0'` if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set; `length` is 30; `flag` is either 0 or 1; `i` is 4.**
