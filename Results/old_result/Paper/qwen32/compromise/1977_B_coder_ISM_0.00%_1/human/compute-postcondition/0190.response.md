Postcondition: **`s` contains 30 elements, each either '1' or '0', representing the binary digits of the input integer `x` from the least significant bit to the most significant bit. If `flag` is 0 and `s[0]` is '0', then `s[0]` is changed to '1'. `flag` remains 0, `length` remains 30, `t` remains unchanged, `nalla` is incremented by 29, `x` is the input integer, and `i` is 0.**
