The code snippet `s[i] = '0'` modifies the element at index `i` of the string `s` to `'0'`. Given that `length` must be greater than `i`, this precondition remains valid after the code execution. The only change is in the string `s` where the character at index `i` is now `'0'`.

Output State: **`length` must be greater than `i`; `s` has its `i`-th character changed to `'0'`**.
