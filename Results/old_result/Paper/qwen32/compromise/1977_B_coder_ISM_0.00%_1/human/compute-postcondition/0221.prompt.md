Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The list `s` contains 30 elements, each either '1' or '0', representing the binary digits of the input integer `x` from the least significant bit to the most significant bit; `flag` is 0; `length` is 30; `t` remains unchanged; `nalla` is incremented by 29; `x` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` contains 30 elements, each either '1' or '0', representing the binary digits of the input integer `x` from the least significant bit to the most significant bit. If `flag` is 1, the first element of `s` is '0' and the rest are either '1' or '0'. If `flag` is 0 and the original `s[0]` was '0', then `s[0]` is now '1'. If `flag` was 0 and `s[i]` was '1' and equal to `s[i + 1]`, then `s[i]` is now `'-1'` and `flag` is 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0, `length` remains 30, `t` remains unchanged, `nalla` is incremented by 29, `x` is the input integer, and `i` is 0. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` contains 30 elements, each either '1', '0', or '-1', representing the binary digits of the input integer `x` from the least significant bit to the most significant bit. If `flag` was initially 1 and `s[i]` was '0', then `s[i]` is now '1' and `flag` is now 0. If `flag` was initially 0 and the original `s[0]` was '0', then `s[0]` is now '1'. If `flag` was initially 0 and `s[i]` was '1' and equal to `s[i + 1]`, then `s[i]` is now `'-1'` and `flag` is 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0, `length` remains 30, `t` remains unchanged, `nalla` is incremented by 29, `x` is the input integer, and `i` is 1. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'. If `flag` is 1, `s[i]` is `'-1'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` contains 30 elements, each either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `flag` was 0 and `s[2]` was equal to `s[3]` and both were '1', then `s[2]` is set to `'-1'` and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, `s[2]` is '0' if `flag` was 1 and `s[2]` was '0', otherwise `s[2]` remains unchanged and `flag` remains unchanged. `length` is 30, `t` remains unchanged, `nalla` is incremented by 29, `x` is the input integer, and `i` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
