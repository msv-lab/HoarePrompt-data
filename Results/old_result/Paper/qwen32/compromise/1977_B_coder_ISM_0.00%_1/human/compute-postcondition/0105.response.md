Postcondition: **The list `s` contains 30 elements, each either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of the integer `x`. The variable `t` remains unchanged. The variable `flag` is 1 (since the if condition is `flag and s[i] == '0'`, `flag` must be 1 for the condition to be true). The variable `length` remains unchanged. The variable `nalla` is incremented by 1. The variable `x` is assigned the value `int(input())`. The current value of `s[i]` is '0'.**
