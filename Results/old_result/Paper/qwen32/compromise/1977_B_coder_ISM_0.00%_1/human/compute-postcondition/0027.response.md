Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list of 30 characters, each being either `'1'` if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or `'0'` if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set; `flag` is 0; `length` is 30; `s[i]` and `s[i + 1]` are both `'1'`**
