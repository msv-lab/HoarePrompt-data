Postcondition: **The list `s` contains 30 elements, each either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of the integer `x`. The variable `t` remains unchanged. The variable `flag` is either 0 or 1. If `flag` is 1, the `i`-th element of `s` is specifically '0'. The variable `length` remains unchanged. The variable `nalla` has been incremented by 1. The variable `x` has been assigned the value `int(input())`. The condition `flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and (s[i] == '1')` is false, meaning either `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'.**
