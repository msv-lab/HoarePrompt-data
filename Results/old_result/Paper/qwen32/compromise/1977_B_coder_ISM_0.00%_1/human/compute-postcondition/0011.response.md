The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range limit, which is 30 in this case. Therefore, we only need to adjust the value of `i` for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 29 (since the loop would have just finished executing with `i` being 29, and we are now preparing for the next iteration). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 30. However, since the range is up to 30 (non-inclusive), the loop will terminate after `i` is 29.

Given that, the state at the start of the next iteration (which would be the last iteration) should have `i` as 29. After this iteration, `i` will be incremented to 30, and the loop will terminate.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list containing either `['1']` if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set, or `['0']` if the `i`-th bit of `x` is not set; `length` is 30; `i` is 29**
