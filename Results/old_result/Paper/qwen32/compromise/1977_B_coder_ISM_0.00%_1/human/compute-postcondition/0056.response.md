Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list of 30 characters where `s[4]` is set to `'-1'` if `flag` was 0, `s[i] == s[i + 1]`, and `s[i] == '1'`, otherwise `s[4]` remains `'0'` if `flag` was 1 and `s[4]` is `'0'`, or `s` is updated such that each element is either `'1'` if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or `'0'` if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set; if `flag` was 1 and `s[5]` is `'0'`, then `s[5]` is specifically set to `'1'`. If `flag` was 0 and `s[i] == s[i + 1]` and `s[i] == '1'`, then `s[5]` is set to `'-1'` and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains either 0 or 1; `length` is 30; `i` is 5.**
