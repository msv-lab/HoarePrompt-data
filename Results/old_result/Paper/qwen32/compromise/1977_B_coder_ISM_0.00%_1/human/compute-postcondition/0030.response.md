Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list of 30 characters, each being either `'1'` if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or `'0'` if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set. `length` is 30; `flag` is 0. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not `'1'`.**
