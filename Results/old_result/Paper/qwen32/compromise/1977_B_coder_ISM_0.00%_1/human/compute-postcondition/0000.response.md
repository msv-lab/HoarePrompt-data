Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` < 2^30.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is reassigned to the value of the integer input by the user. The conditions on `t` and `x` remain the same as in the initial state.
