Postcondition: **The list `s` is either `['1']` or `['0']`, depending on whether the `i`-th bit of `x` is set or not. The variables `t`, `flag`, `length`, and `nalla` remain unchanged except that `nalla` is incremented by 1. The variable `x` is assigned the value `int(input())`.**

This postcondition summarizes that the list `s` will contain either `['1']` if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set, or `['0']` if the `i`-th bit of `x` is not set. The other variables `t`, `flag`, and `length` remain as they were initially, while `nalla` is incremented by 1, and `x` is reassigned the value from user input.
