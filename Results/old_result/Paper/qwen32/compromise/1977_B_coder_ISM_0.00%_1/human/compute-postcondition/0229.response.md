Postcondition: **`s` is a list of 30 elements where consecutive '1's pairs are replaced by '-1' and '0's following '-1' are flipped to '1', unless `flag` is not 0, in which case `s` is a list of 31 elements with the first 30 elements following the same rule and the 31st element being '0'. `flag` remains unchanged and is not 0 if the if condition is met. `length` is 30 unless `flag` is not 0, in which case `length` is 31. `t` remains unchanged. `nalla` is incremented by 29 for each iteration. `x` is the input integer.**
