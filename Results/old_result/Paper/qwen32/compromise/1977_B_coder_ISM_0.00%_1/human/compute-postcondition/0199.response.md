Postcondition: **`s` contains 30 elements, each either '1' or '0', representing the binary digits of the input integer `x` from the least significant bit to the most significant bit. If `flag` is 1, the first element of `s` is '0' and the rest are either '1' or '0'. If `flag` is 0 and the original `s[0]` was '0', then `s[0]` is now '1'. `flag` is either 0 or 1, `length` remains 30, `t` remains unchanged, `nalla` is incremented by 29, `x` is the input integer, and `i` is 0. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'.**
