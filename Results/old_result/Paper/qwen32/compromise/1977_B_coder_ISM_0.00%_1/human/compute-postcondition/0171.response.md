The list `s` is an empty list initially, and after appending `'1'`, it becomes `['1']`. The variables `flag`, `length`, and `t` remain unchanged. The variable `nalla` is incremented by 29, so if it was initially `n`, it is now `n + 29`. The variable `x` is an input integer, and the `i`-th bit of `x` is 1, which remains unchanged by the given code.

Output State: **The list `s` is `['1']`; `flag` remains unchanged; `length` is 30; `t` remains unchanged; `nalla` is `n + 29`; `x` is an input integer, and the `i`-th bit of `x` is 1.**
