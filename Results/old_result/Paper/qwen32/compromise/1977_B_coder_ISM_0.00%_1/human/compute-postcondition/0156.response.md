The code snippet `s[i - 1] = '-1'` changes the character at the `(i - 1)`-th index of the string `s` to `'-1'`. Given the initial state, where `s` has its `i`-th character changed to `'0'`, this operation will overwrite the character at the `(i - 1)`-th index with `'-1'`.

Output State: **`length` must be greater than `i`; `s` has its `i`-th character changed to `'0'` and its `(i - 1)`-th character changed to `'-1'`**.
