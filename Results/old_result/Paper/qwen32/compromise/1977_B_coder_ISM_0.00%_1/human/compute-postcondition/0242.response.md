The code snippet `s[i - 1] = '-1'` modifies the list `s` by setting the element at index `i - 1` to `'-1'`. Given that `i` is 3, the element at index `2` of the list `s` is set to `'-1'`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`s` is a list of 30 or 31 elements where the element at index 2 is '-1' and the element at index 3 is '0', `flag` is 0 or 1, `length` is 30 or 31, `t` remains unchanged, `nalla` is incremented by 29 for each iteration, `x` is the input integer, `i` is 3**.
