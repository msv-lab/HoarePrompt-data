Postcondition: **`s` is a list of 30 elements where consecutive '1's pairs are replaced by '-1' and '0's following '-1' are flipped to '1', except if `flag` is not 0 and `s[29]` is '0', in which case `s` becomes a list of 31 elements with the first 30 elements following the same rule and the 31st element being '0'. `flag` is 1 if `flag` was initially 0 and `s[29]` was '0'; otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged. `length` is 30 if `flag` is 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'; otherwise, `length` is 31. `t` remains unchanged. `nalla` is incremented by 29 for each iteration. `x` is the input integer.**
