Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically, the code does not ensure that there does not exist an index \(0 \leq i \leq n-2\) such that both \(a_i \neq 0\) and \(a_{i+1} \neq 0\). This means that consecutive non-zero elements can appear in the output array, which is not allowed according to the problem statement.

Let's analyze the code with an example to demonstrate the issue:

### Example Input:
```
1
4
```

### Expected Output:
```
3
0 0 1
```
Explanation: \(4 = 0 \cdot 2^0 + 0 \cdot 2^1 + 1 \cdot 2^2\)

### Actual Output from the Program:
```
3
1 0 0
```

However, this program might seem to work for this simple case, but let's consider another example:

### Example Input:
```
1
6
```

### Expected Output:
```
4
-1 0 0 1
```
Explanation: \(6 = -1 \cdot 2^0 + 0 \cdot 2^1 + 0 \cdot 2^2 + 1 \cdot 2^3\)

### Actual Output from the Program:
```
4
0 1 1 0
```
This output is incorrect because it has consecutive non-zero elements (1 and 1 at indices 1 and 2), which violates the problem's constraints.

### Another Example Input:
```
1
15
```

### Expected Output:
```
5
-1 0 0 0 1
```
Explanation: \(15 = -1 \cdot 2^0 + 0 \cdot 2^1 + 0 \cdot 2^2 + 0 \cdot 2^3 + 1 \cdot 2^4\)

### Actual Output from the Program:
```
5
1 1 1 1 0
```
This output is also incorrect because it has consecutive non-zero elements (1s at indices 0, 1, 2, and 3), which violates the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the condition that no two consecutive elements in the array can be non-zero. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
