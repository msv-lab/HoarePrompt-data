Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to solve the problem but does not correctly handle the constraints and requirements specified. Here are some key issues:

1. **Binary Conversion**: The program converts the number `x` to its binary representation but does not incorporate the additional requirement that no two consecutive non-zero elements (1 or -1) should exist in the array.

2. **Array Modification**: The program tries to modify the binary array to meet the problem's constraints but does so in a way that can lead to incorrect results. For example, the logic for handling consecutive 1s is flawed and can produce incorrect sequences.

3. **Output Format**: The program outputs the length and the array in the wrong order. The length of the array should be printed before the array itself.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly, especially when dealing with numbers that require specific sequences of 1s, 0s, and -1s to meet the constraints.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        s = []
        i = 0
        while x > 0:
            if x % 2 == 1:
                s.append(1)
                x -= 1
            elif x % 4 == 2:
                s.append(-1)
                s.append(1)
                x -= 2
            else:
                s.append(0)
            x //= 2
            i += 1
        
        # Ensure the array length is at most 32
        while len(s) < 32:
            s.append(0)
        
        # Reverse the array to get the correct order
        s.reverse()
        
        # Remove trailing zeros
        while s and s[-1] == 0:
            s.pop()
        
        # Print the length and the array
        print(len(s))
        print(' '.join(map(str, s)))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the constraints are met and handles the input-output format correctly.
