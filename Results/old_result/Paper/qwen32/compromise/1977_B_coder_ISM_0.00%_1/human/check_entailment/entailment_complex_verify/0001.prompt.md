You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

    24

Output

    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

    #State: The loop will have processed all `t` test cases. For each test case, the list `s` will be transformed such that no consecutive `'-1'` and `'1'` pairs exist, and all `'-1'`s are moved to the leftmost positions, followed by `0`s, and then the rest of the elements, which will be either `0` or `1`. The variable `flag` will be either 0 or 1, and `length` will be either 30 or 31. The variable `t` will remain unchanged, and `nalla` will have completed iterating through all `t` test cases. The variable `x` will be the input integer for the current test case being processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `x`. For each `x`, it performs a series of transformations on its binary representation, ensuring no consecutive `'-1'` and `'1'` pairs exist, and outputs the transformed binary string along with its length.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a positive integer `x`.

2. **Initial Binary Conversion:**
   - The program converts `x` into a binary string representation of length 30 (since the maximum value of `x` is less than \(2^{30}\)).
   - It uses bitwise operations to check if each bit is set and appends '1' or '0' to the list `s`.

3. **Adjustments to Meet Problem Constraints:**
   - The program then iterates over the list `s` to ensure that no two consecutive elements are both non-zero.
   - If two consecutive '1's are found, it converts the first '1' to '-1' and sets a flag to indicate that the next '0' should be converted to '1' to maintain the value of `x`.
   - If a '1' is found after a '-1', it swaps them to ensure the non-consecutive non-zero constraint.

4. **Final Adjustments:**
   - If the flag is still set after the loop and the last element is '0', it converts it to '1'.
   - If the flag is set and the last element is not '0', it adds an additional '1' to the list, increasing the length.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the adjusted list `s`.
   - It then prints the elements of `s`.

### Issues Identified:

- **Binary Conversion and Adjustment Logic:**
  - The initial binary conversion and subsequent adjustments are not correctly implemented to ensure that the resulting array meets the problem constraints.
  - The program does not correctly handle the conversion of '1's to '-1's and subsequent adjustments to maintain the value of `x`.

- **Output Formatting:**
  - The program prints the binary representation before making the necessary adjustments, which is incorrect.
  - The length and elements of the final adjusted array are printed, but the adjustments are not correctly implemented.

### Correctness:

Given the identified issues, the program does not correctly generate an array that meets the problem's constraints. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
