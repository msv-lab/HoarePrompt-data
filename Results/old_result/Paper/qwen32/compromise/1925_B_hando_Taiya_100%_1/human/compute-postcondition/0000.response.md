The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two integers, and assigns them to the variables `x` and `n`. This means that the initial values of `x` and `n` provided in the initial state will be overwritten by the values read from the input.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; For each of the t test cases, x and n are integers read from the input such that 1 <= x <= 10^8 and 1 <= n <= x.**

In simpler terms, after executing the code, `x` and `n` will hold the values read from the input, and `t` remains unchanged.
