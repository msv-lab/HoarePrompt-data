Postcondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; n is an integer greater than 0; a is a sorted list of integers; r is a[i + 1] where i = n - 2 (the last element of a); rem is 0; y is 0; k is equal to 0 after being reduced by the sum of (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) for all i from 0 to n - 2**
