The value of `r` is updated to `a[n - 1] + k // n`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a sorted list of integers, ii is incremented by 1, y is 0, rem is 0, r is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, k is not equal to 0.**
