To determine the output state, we need to consider the given initial state and the provided code snippet. Here's the breakdown:

- Initial State: 
  - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
  - `n` is an integer greater than 0.
  - `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.
  - `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

- Code Snippet:
  ```python
  r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
  ```

From the code snippet, we see that a new variable `r` is introduced and assigned the value of `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. The value of `r` depends on the current value of `i`, the list `a`, and another variable `k` which is not mentioned in the initial state. We'll assume `k` is a predefined integer value in the context of the program.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `i` is now pointing to the next index in the list `a`.

Therefore, the output state will include:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` remains an integer greater than 0.
- `a` remains a sorted list of integers.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `r` is calculated as `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is incremented by 1; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`**.
