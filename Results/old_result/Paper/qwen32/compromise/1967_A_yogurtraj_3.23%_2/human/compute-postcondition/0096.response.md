The code snippet calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `(i + 1)` and assigns it to the variable `rem`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `ii` is incremented by 1, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is 0, and `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`.**
