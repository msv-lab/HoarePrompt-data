Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input minus `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `ii` is incremented by 1, `r` is the element `a[i + 1]` of the list `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and the condition ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) <= k) holds true.**

Explanation: The value of `r` is updated to be the element at index `i + 1` in the list `a`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
