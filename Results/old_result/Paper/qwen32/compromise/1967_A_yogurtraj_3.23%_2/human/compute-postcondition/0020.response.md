The given code snippet calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `(i + 1)` and assigns it to the variable `rem`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `r`) are not modified by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the only change is the introduction of the variable `rem` which holds the result of `k % (i + 1)`. Since the exact value of `k` and `i` are not specified, we express `rem` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `r` is assigned the value `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`**.
