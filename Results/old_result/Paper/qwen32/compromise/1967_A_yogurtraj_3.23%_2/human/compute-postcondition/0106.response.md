The code snippet calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1` and assigns it to `rem`. Given that `i` is 4, `rem` will be `k % 5`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `y` is 0, `rem` is `k % 5`, `i` is 4, `r` is `a[4] + k // 5`**.
