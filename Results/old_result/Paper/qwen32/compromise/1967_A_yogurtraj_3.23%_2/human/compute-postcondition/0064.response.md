The code snippet assigns the value `n - 1 - i` to the variable `y`. Given the initial state, the values of `n` and `i` are known to affect `y`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `ii`, `r`, `rem`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1, `ii` is incremented by 1, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`.**
