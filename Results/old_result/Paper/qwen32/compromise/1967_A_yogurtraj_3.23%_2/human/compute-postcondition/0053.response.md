The given code snippet updates the value of `rem` by calculating the remainder of `k` divided by `(i + 1)`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `y`, `k`, `ii`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is 0, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `ii` is incremented by 1, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`**
