Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `ii` is incremented by 1 (though `ii` is not used in the print statement, it's mentioned in the initial state).
- `y` is 0.
- `rem` is 0.
- `r` is the last element of the list `a` (i.e., `a[n - 1]`).
- `k` is 0 (though `k` is not used in the print statement, it's mentioned in the initial state).

### Print Statement:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)
```

### Analysis:
- `r` is the last element of the sorted list `a`, so `r = a[n - 1]`.
- `y` is explicitly given as 0.
- `rem` is explicitly given as 0.
- Substituting these values into the expression, we get:
  \[
  (r - 1) \times n + 1 + 0 + 0 = (r - 1) \times n + 1
  \]

### Final Expression:
The expression simplifies to \((r - 1) \times n + 1\), where `r` is the last element of the sorted list `a`.

### Output:
Output: **(r - 1) * n + 1 (where r is the last element of the sorted list `a`)**
