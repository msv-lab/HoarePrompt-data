To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet in the context of the initial state.

The code snippet is:
```python
r += a[x]
```

However, there is a variable `a` that is not mentioned in the initial state. For the sake of this task, let's assume that `a` is a list of characters or strings that corresponds to the indices of `s`. Given that `x` is the index of `n` in the list `s`, `a[x]` would be the element at the same index in `a`.

Since the variable `a` is not defined in the initial state, we can't determine its exact values. For the purpose of this task, let's assume `a` is a predefined list of characters or strings, and `a[x]` is a specific character or string at index `x`.

Given the initial state and the code, the variable `r` (which is initially an empty string) will be updated to include the value of `a[x]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `r` is a string containing the value of `a[x]`; `x` is the index of `n` in the list `s`.**

In simple terms, the output state is that `r` now contains the value from `a` at the index `x`, which is the index of `n` in the list `s`. All other variables retain their initial states.
