The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which takes the value of the next element in the list `s` during each iteration. According to the provided information, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `s_next`, which is the next element in the list `s`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should take the value of the next element in the list `s` after `s_next`.

Let's denote the current value of `i` (which is `s_next`) as `s[j]`. Therefore, in the next iteration, `i` should be `s[j+1]` provided that `j+1` is a valid index in the list `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `s` is the list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `r` is the string `2 * a[x]`; `b` is a list with the value at index `x` incremented by 1 (again); `x` is the index of `i` in `b`; `i` is the next element in the list `s` after `s_next`**

To make it more precise, if `i` was `s[j]` at the end of the last iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `s[j+1]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `s` is the list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements; `r` is the string `2 * a[x]`; `b` is a list with the value at index `x` incremented by 1 (again); `x` is the index of `i` in `b`; `i` is `s[j+1]` where `j` is the index of `s_next` in `s`**
