The code snippet `b[x] += 1` increments the value at index `x` in the list `b` by 1. Given the initial state, the value of `b[x]` is incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `s` is the list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements; `r` is the string `3 * a[x]`; `b` is a list with the value at index `x` incremented by 1 (again); `x` is the index of the first occurrence of `i` in `b`; `i` is `s[j+1]` where `j` is the index of `s_next` in `s`.**
