Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `r` is a string containing the value of `a[x]`; `x` is the index of `n` in the list `s`; `b[x]` is incremented by 1.**

In simple terms, the value at index `x` in the list `b` is increased by 1, while all other variables retain their initial values.
