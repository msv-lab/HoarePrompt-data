The code snippet `r += a[x]` concatenates the string `r` with the string value of `a[x]`. Given the initial state, `r` is initially the string `a[x]`, and after the operation, `r` will be `a[x] + a[x]`, which is `2 * a[x]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `b`, `x`, `i`, and `s_next`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `s` is the list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `r` is the string `2 * a[x]`; `b` is a list with the value at index `x` incremented by 1; `x` is the index of `i` in `b`; `i` is `s_next`, where `s_next` is the next element in the list `s`.**
