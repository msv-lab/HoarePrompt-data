The code creates a new list `c` where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of `n` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9; the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each `c_i` is the minimum of `a_i` and `b_i`.**
