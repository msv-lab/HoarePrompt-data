Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The approach taken in the function `func_1` is not optimal and does not guarantee the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in line. 

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. The function `func_1` calculates a list `c` where each element is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This is not the correct strategy because the cost to move Kirill to a position `i` involves both `a[j]` and the sum of `b[k]` for `j < k < i`. The function does not account for the `b[k]` costs correctly.

2. The suffix sum array `suff` is calculated using the list `c`, which does not accurately represent the cost to move Kirill past a certain position. The suffix sum should be calculated based on the actual costs involved in moving Kirill, taking into account both `a[j]` and `b[k]` costs.

3. The final answer is determined by finding the minimum of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for `i < k`. This does not correctly account for the total cost to move Kirill to position `i` and then past it, considering all necessary `b[k]` costs.

To solve the problem correctly, a priority queue (min-heap) can be used to always move Kirill to the most cost-effective position. This involves considering the `a[j]` cost to swap with a person at position `j` and the `b[k]` costs to move past all people between `j` and `i`. The correct approach involves more complex logic to ensure that all costs are accurately considered.

Here is an outline of a correct approach:

1. Use a priority queue to always consider the smallest `a[j]` cost available.
2. Maintain a running sum of `b[k]` costs for people between the current position and the target position.
3. For each position `i` from `0` to `k-1`, calculate the total cost to move Kirill to that position and then past it, considering all necessary `b[k]` costs.
4. Track the minimum cost encountered during this process.

The provided program does not implement this correct approach, so it is incorrect.
