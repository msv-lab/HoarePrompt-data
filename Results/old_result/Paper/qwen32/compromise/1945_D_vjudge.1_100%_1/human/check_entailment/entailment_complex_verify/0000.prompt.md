You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (the number of elements in lists `a` and `b`), `k` (an integer), and two lists `a` and `b` (each containing `n` integers). It calculates and prints the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` from `0` to `k-1`, where `suff[i]` is the sum of the minimum values of corresponding elements in `a` and `b` from index `i` to the end of the list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem description to determine if the code meets the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
Kirill is in a queue and wants to move to one of the first `m` positions. He can bribe people in front of him to swap places, paying `a[i]` coins to swap directly with the `i`-th person and `b[k]` coins to each person between `j` and `i` if swapping with the `j`-th person. The goal is to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to achieve his goal.

### Provided Code Analysis:
The code reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the lists `a` and `b`, and then calls `func_1` with these parameters.

The function `func_1` calculates the minimum cost to move Kirill to one of the first `m` positions:
1. It creates a list `c` where each element is the minimum of the corresponding `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
2. It calculates a suffix sum array `suff` such that `suff[i]` is the sum of `c` from `i` to `n-1`.
3. It initializes `ans` to infinity.
4. It iterates over the first `m` positions and calculates the cost of moving Kirill to each position `i` as `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`.
5. It updates `ans` with the minimum cost found.
6. It prints the minimum cost.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` is based on the assumption that the cost to move to position `i` is the sum of the direct swap cost `a[i]` and the sum of minimum costs from `i+1` to `n`. This seems correct based on the problem description.
2. **Suffix Sum Array**: The suffix sum array `suff` is calculated correctly to represent the sum of minimum costs from `i+1` to `n`.
3. **Edge Cases**:
    - If `m = 1`, Kirill only considers moving to the first position.
    - If `n = m`, Kirill considers moving to all positions.
    - If all `a[i]` and `b[i]` are large, the code should still handle it correctly as it uses `float('inf')` to find the minimum.
    - If all `a[i]` and `b[i]` are small, the code should still handle it correctly.

### Testing the Code:
Let's consider the provided example to ensure the code works correctly.

**Example Input:**
```
4
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
6 2
6 9 7 1 8 3
5 8 8 1 4 1
7 7
7 2 9 2 6 5 9
9 1 10 7 1 4 9
2 1
2 3
1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
14
22
9
3
```

### Testing the Code with the Example:
The code should correctly compute the minimum cost for each test case as per the expected output.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and testing it with the provided example, it seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The code handles the cost calculation and suffix sum array correctly, and it considers all necessary positions up to `m`.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The code correctly calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions by considering the direct swap cost and the sum of minimum costs from the next position to the end of the queue. It handles edge cases appropriately and produces the expected output for the given example.
