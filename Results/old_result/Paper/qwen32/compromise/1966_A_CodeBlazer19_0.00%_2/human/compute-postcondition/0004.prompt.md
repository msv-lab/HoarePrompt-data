You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100. The list of integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n represents the numbers written on the cards and each c_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(k - 1)
        
    #State: For each of the `t` test cases, the output will be `k - 1`. The values of `n`, `k`, and the list `l` will be different for each test case based on the input, but the output for each test case will specifically be the value of `k - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of integers `c_1, c_2, ..., c_n` representing the numbers written on the cards. The function returns the count of numbers in the list that are divisible by `k` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
