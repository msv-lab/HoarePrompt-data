The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `t` needs to be ensured to be within the range 1 to 500, which is already given in the problem statement. The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts as it is initialized by the `range(t)` function.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `i` is initialized by `range(t)`**
