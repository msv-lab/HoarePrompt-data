You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/ac8986e55ddc41e4d0ee63ac67222f97e7fcc1bf.png)

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(k - 1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100. The list of integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n represents the numbers written on the cards and each c_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(k - 1)
        
    #State: For each of the `t` test cases, the output will be `k - 1`. The values of `n`, `k`, and the list `l` will be different for each test case based on the input, but the output for each test case will specifically be the value of `k - 1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program always outputs `k - 1` for every test case, regardless of the input values. This is incorrect because the minimum number of cards left after performing the described operations depends on the distribution of card numbers and not just on the value of `k`.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

**Example:**
```
Input:
1
5 3
4 1 1 4 4

Expected Output:
2

Actual Output:
2

This specific example happens to work, but let's consider another one:
Input:
1
5 3
1 1 1 1 1

Expected Output:
2

Actual Output:
2

This also happens to work, but let's consider a case where the program will fail:
Input:
1
4 2
1 1 2 2

Expected Output:
2

Actual Output:
1

Explanation:
For the input 4 2 1 1 2 2, you can perform the following operations:
1. Choose two 1's and replace them with one card of any number. Now you have [1, 2, 2, x] (where x can be any number).
2. Choose two 2's and replace them with one card of any number. Now you have [1, x, y] (where x and y can be any numbers).

So, the minimum number of cards left is 2, but the program would output 1.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the minimum number of cards for all possible inputs.
