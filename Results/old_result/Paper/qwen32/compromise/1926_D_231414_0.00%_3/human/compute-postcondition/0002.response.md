In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times defined by `times`. The loop will execute if `times` is greater than 0. The variables `t` and `check` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be directly adjusted to affect whether the loop executes.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted such that `times` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The values of `t` and `check` do not influence the execution of the loop and therefore do not need to be changed.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `times` must be greater than 0, `check` is 2147483647**
