#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100), ans is 0, cnt is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list a and its value is the count of occurrences of that integer in the list a.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
        
    #State: - After the loop finishes executing, `ans` will hold the sum of all `x // 3` for each `x` in `cnt.values()`.
    #   - The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and the structure of `cnt` will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
    #
    #Therefore, the output state will be:
    #
    #Output State:
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of x // 3 for each x in cnt.values())
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of sticks. It calculates and prints the sum of the integer division of the count of each unique stick length by 3.
