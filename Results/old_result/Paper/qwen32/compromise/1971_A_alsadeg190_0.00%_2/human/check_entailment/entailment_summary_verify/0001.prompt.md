You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9

    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, and prints the larger of the two followed by the smaller one.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve the problem as described. Here is a step-by-step analysis:

1. The program starts by reading the integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
2. It then enters a loop that iterates `t` times.
3. For each iteration, it reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y`.
4. The program then checks if `x` is greater than `y`.
   - If true, it prints `x` followed by `y`. However, this is incorrect because it should print the minimum value first, followed by the maximum value.
   - If false, it prints `y` followed by `x`. This is also incorrect because it does not ensure that the minimum value is printed first.
5. The problem requires the output to be the minimum of `x` and `y` followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`.

The issue in the program is the conditional check and the order of printing. The correct approach would be to use the `min()` and `max()` functions to ensure the correct order of output.

Corrected Code (for reference):
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(min(x, y), max(x, y))
```

Given the original program, it does not correctly implement the required functionality.

Correctness: **False**
