The code snippet `x = int(input())` will overwrite the previous value of `x` with the integer value provided by the input. The values of `t` and `y` remain unchanged. Since `x` is reassigned, its new value will be the integer input provided.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, x is the integer input provided, y is an integer such that 0 <= y <= 9.**
