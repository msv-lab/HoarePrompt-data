Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be at least 4, `p` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `n-2` set to `n-2`, `ind` is `n - 4`, `i` is `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `ind` has been decremented by 2, so if it was initially `n - 2`, it is now `n - 4`. All other variables retain their initial values.
