The value of `ind` is decremented by 2. Initially, `ind` is `n - 4`. After the operation, `ind` becomes `(n - 4) - 2`, which simplifies to `n - 6`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be at least 4, `p` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `n-2` set to `n-4`, `ind` is `n - 6`, `i` is `n - 2`.**
