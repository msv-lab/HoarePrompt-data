The code snippet `ind = n` assigns the value of `n` to `ind`. The initial state specifies that `ind` is originally `n`, and this assignment does not change that fact since `ind` is explicitly set to `n` again. The other variables `t`, `p`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `p` is a list of `n` zeros, `ind` is the first integer from the input, `i` is incremented by 1.**
