Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `p` is a list of `n` elements where the value at index `i + 2` is `ind` (5 if `n` is even, 6 if `n` is odd), all other elements remain as initially specified.**

Explanation: The value of `ind` is incremented by 2. Initially, `ind` is 3 if `n` is even and 4 if `n` is odd. After incrementing, `ind` becomes 5 if `n` is even and 6 if `n` is odd. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the list `p` has its specific element at index `i + 2` updated accordingly.
