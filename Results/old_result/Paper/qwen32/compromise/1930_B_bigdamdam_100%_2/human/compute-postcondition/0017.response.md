Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `p` is a list of `n` elements where the value at index `i` is `ind` and all other elements remain as initially specified, `ind` is 3 if `n` is even, 4 if `n` is odd.**

Explanation: The value of `ind` is incremented by 2. Initially, `ind` is 1 if `n` is even and 2 if `n` is odd. After the increment, `ind` becomes 3 if `n` is even, and 4 if `n` is odd. The other variables and the list `p` remain unchanged.
