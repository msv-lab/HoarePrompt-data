The code snippet `p[i] = ind` modifies the list `p` by setting the element at index `i` to the value of `ind`. Given the initial state, `p` is a list where the first part is a decreasing sequence starting from `ind` and the rest are zeros, and `ind` is `1 + n % 2`.

Since the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe the general change based on the given information. The element at index `i` in the list `p` will be set to `ind`, which is `1 + n % 2`.

Output State: **`p` has values `[ind, ind-2, ind-4, ..., ind-2*(floor(n/2)-1), 0, 0, ..., 0]` with the element at index `i` set to `ind`, `ind` is `1 + n % 2`, `n` must be greater than 1.**

In natural language: The list `p` remains the same except that the element at index `i` is now set to `ind`, which is `1 + n % 2`. The rest of the list, including the sequence and the zeros, remains unchanged.
