In the given task, the for loop statement is:

```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `n`. The variable `i` is initialized within the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. The variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted for the loop to execute.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `n` must be greater than 0**
