You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob wants to maximize his profit by selling `n` buns. He has two pricing strategies:
1. The first `k` buns are sold at decreasing prices starting from `b`, `b-1`, ..., `b-k+1`.
2. The remaining `n-k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

The goal is to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the total profit.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem, we need to compute the profit for different values of `k` and choose the one that gives the maximum profit. The profit for a given `k` can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit}(k) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1) + (n - k) \times a \]

This can be simplified to:
\[ \text{Profit}(k) = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \]

The function `func_1` in the provided program does not correctly compute the profit for a given `k`. Instead, it checks if the sum of the prices of the first `k` buns at the modified price plus the prices of the remaining `n-k` buns at the usual price is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`. This condition does not help in maximizing the profit.

### Binary Search Misuse:
The binary search in the provided program is trying to find the maximum `k` that satisfies the condition in `func_1`. However, this condition is not related to maximizing the profit. The binary search should be used to find the `k` that maximizes the profit, but the profit calculation in `func_1` is incorrect.

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly solve the problem, we should calculate the profit for each possible `k` and find the maximum. However, this can be optimized using the properties of the quadratic function that represents the profit.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum profit because the condition in `func_1` is incorrect and the binary search is misused.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The provided program incorrectly computes the profit for a given `k` and misuses binary search to find the maximum profit. The condition in `func_1` does not help in maximizing the profit.
Correctness: **False**
