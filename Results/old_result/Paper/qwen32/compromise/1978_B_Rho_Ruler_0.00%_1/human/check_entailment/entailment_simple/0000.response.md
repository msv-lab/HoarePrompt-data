Reasoning:

The given program is intended to determine the maximum profit Bob can make by selling his buns under the given promotion rules. However, the provided `func_1` function does not correctly determine the profit for a given `k`. Instead, it checks if the sum of the prices of the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`. This condition does not help in maximizing the profit. 

To correctly solve the problem, we need to compute the profit for each possible value of `k` and find the one that gives the maximum profit. The profit for a given `k` is calculated as the sum of the prices of the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price. This can be done using the formula:

\[ \text{Profit}(k) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1) + (n - k) \times a \]

This simplifies to:

\[ \text{Profit}(k) = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \]

The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of `k` from 0 to `min(n, b)` and computing the profit for each `k`, keeping track of the maximum profit found.

Given the current implementation of `func_1`, the binary search in the main loop is not correctly identifying the optimal `k` for maximum profit, and thus the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
