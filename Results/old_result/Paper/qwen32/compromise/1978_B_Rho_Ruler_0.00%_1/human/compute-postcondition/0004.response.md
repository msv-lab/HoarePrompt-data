Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n`. The parameter `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), and both `a` and `b` are integers within the range 1 to 10^9, inclusive. The parameter `n` is also an integer within the range 1 to 10^9, inclusive. The function returns `True`.**
