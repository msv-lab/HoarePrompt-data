The code snippet provided initializes a list named `nums` with `n` zeros. Given the initial state, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers with specific constraints. The code only affects the `nums` list, initializing it with `n` zeros for each test case. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `nums` is a list of `n` zeros.**
