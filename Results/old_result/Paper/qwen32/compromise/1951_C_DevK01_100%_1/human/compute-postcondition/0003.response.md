Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. Here, `n` represents the number of sale days, `m` is the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased each day, `k` is the total number of tickets to be bought, and `a_i` represents the price per ticket for each day. For each test case, the function determines the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets over the `n` days, considering the daily ticket limits and prices.**
