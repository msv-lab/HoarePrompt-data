Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to `t`, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is an integer value of `info[1]` and is at least 1, `suma` is 0, `x` is 3, and the expression `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0)` is true.**
