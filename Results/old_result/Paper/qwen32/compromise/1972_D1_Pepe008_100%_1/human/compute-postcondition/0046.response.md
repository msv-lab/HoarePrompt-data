Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to `t`, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is an integer value of `info[1]` and is at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been recalculated using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`, and the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions as described.
