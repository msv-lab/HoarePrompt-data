Let's analyze the given state and the for loop to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `b` remains the same
- `x` is `(a - (i + 1) * i) // (i + 1)` if `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`

The for loop is:
```python
for i in range(1, b + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

In the loop head, the only variable that can be adjusted is `i`. The variable `b` remains unchanged, and `x` is calculated based on the current value of `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i + 1`. For the next iteration to start, `i` should be incremented by 1 again, so it should be `i + 2`.

The state of `b` remains the same, and `x` should be recalculated based on the new value of `i`, which is `i + 2`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is `i + 2`
- `b` remains the same
- `x` is `(a - (i + 2) * (i + 1)) // (i + 2)`

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `b` remains the same, `x` is `(a - (i + 2) * (i + 1)) // (i + 2)`**
