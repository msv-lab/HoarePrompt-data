The code snippet `suma = 0` sets the variable `suma` to 0. The other variables `t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to `t`, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`, `suma` is 0.**
