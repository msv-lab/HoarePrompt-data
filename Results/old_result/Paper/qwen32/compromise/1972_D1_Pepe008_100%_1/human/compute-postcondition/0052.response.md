The initial state provides us with the value of the variable `suma`, which is 15. The `print` statement calculates `suma - 2` and prints the result. Since `suma` is explicitly given as 15, we can directly compute the value to be printed.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. `suma` is given as 15.
2. The expression `suma - 2` is evaluated as `15 - 2`, which equals 13.
3. The `print` statement outputs the result of the expression, which is 13.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **13**
