The code snippet provided modifies the values of `i`, `x`, and `suma`. Let's break down the changes:

1. `i` is reassigned to `i + 1`, so `i` is now incremented by 1.
2. `x` is recalculated using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.
3. `suma` is updated by adding the new value of `x` to it.

Given the initial state, `b` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new values of `i`, `x`, and `suma`, while `b` will retain its original value.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `b` remains the same, `x` is `(a - (i + 1) * i) // (i + 1)`, `suma` is `suma + (a - (i + 1) * i) // (i + 1)`**.
