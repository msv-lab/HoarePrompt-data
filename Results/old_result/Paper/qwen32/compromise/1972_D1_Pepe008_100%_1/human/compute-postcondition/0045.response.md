The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `b`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables for the next iteration of the loop. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` had a certain value, and the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `b`. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. The value of `b` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

Let's determine the new state:

- `i` at the end of the previous iteration was some value, let's call it `i_prev`. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.
- `b` remains the same.
- `t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, and `x` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Given that `i` was `i_prev` at the end of the last iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i_prev + 1`. Since the loop condition is `i in range(1, b + 1)`, the loop will continue as long as `i <= b`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to `t`, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is an integer value of `info[1]` and is at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`**.

Since we do not have the exact value of `i_prev`, we can generalize it as `i` being incremented by 1 from its previous value. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to `t`, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is an integer value of `info[1]` and is at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise, if we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`, then at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to `t`, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is an integer value of `info[1]` and is at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`**.

Since we do not have the exact value of `i_prev`, we can simply state that `i` is incremented by 1:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to `t`, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is an integer value of `info[1]` and is at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

For clarity, let's denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1`:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to `t`, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is an integer value of `info[1]` and is at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `i` is `i + 1`**

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to `t`, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is an integer value of `info[1]` and is at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
