To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `b`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `T` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input.
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`.
- `b` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is `i + 1` (This means `i` has just been incremented).
- `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.
- If `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i` is not zero, `suma` is set to `x`; otherwise, `suma` remains 0.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value. The other variables (`t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `suma`) do not need to be adjusted because they are not directly part of the loop head.

Here is the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i` is not zero, `suma` is set to `x`; otherwise, `suma` remains 0.**

However, since `i` needs to be incremented at the start of the next iteration, we adjust `i` accordingly:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `(a - (i + 1) * i) // (i + 1)`. If `(a - (i + 1) * i) % (i + 1)` is not zero, `suma` is set to `x`; otherwise, `suma` remains 0.**

But since `i` is incremented within the loop, the correct state at the start of the next iteration before the increment operation is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i` is not zero, `suma` is set to `x`; otherwise, `suma` remains 0.**

However, to reflect the state at the start of the next iteration where `i` will be incremented, we need to consider `i` as it is before the increment:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i` is not zero, `suma` is set to `x`; otherwise, `suma` remains 0.**

But to be precise for the next iteration start before the increment, we adjust `i` to reflect the next value:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`.**

So the final adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`.**
