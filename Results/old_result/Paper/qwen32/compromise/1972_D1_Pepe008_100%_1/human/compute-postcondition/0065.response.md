The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `b + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `suma` is determined by the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i` and whether it is zero or not. However, since we are only concerned with adjusting the state of variables in the loop head, we do not need to modify `suma` or any other variable outside the loop head.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` must have been some value that allowed the loop to execute. For the next iteration to occur, `i` must be incremented by 1 and should still be less than `b + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i + 1`, and `b` remains the same.**

Since we do not have the specific value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can represent the state as:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `b` remains the same.**

However, to be more precise, if we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`. Since we don't have `i_prev`, we can represent it generally as:
State: **`i` is the next integer in the sequence, `b` remains the same.**

For clarity, if we assume `i` was `i_prev` at the end of the last iteration, then:
State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `b` remains the same.**

Given that we need to adjust only `i` and we don't have the specific value of `i` from the previous iteration, the most accurate general representation is:
State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `b` remains the same.**

So, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `b` remains the same.**
