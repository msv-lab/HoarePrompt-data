### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The program iterates over each possible value of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\) and calculates the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\). Here is the critical part of the code:
```python
for i in range(1, b + 1):
    x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
    if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
        suma += x
        if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
            suma += 1
```
The code seems to be using a derived formula to count the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\). However, this formula does not directly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Verification of the Condition:
To correctly verify the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), we need to explicitly check:
\[ (a + b) \% (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0 \]
The provided code does not perform this check and instead relies on a derived formula, which may not be accurate.

#### Testing with Examples:
Let's test the code with the provided examples to see if it produces the correct output.

#### Test Case 1:
Input:
```
1
1 1
```
Expected Output:
```
1
```
The code should output `1` as the only valid pair is \((1, 1)\).

#### Test Case 2:
Input:
```
1
2 3
```
Expected Output:
```
3
```
The valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).

#### Test Case 3:
Input:
```
1
3 5
```
Expected Output:
```
4
```
The valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((3, 1)\), and \((3, 3)\).

#### Test Case 4:
Input:
```
1
10 8
```
Expected Output:
```
14
```
The valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 1)\), \((4, 1)\), \((5, 1)\), \((6, 1)\), \((6, 2)\), \((6, 3)\), \((7, 1)\), \((8, 1)\), \((9, 1)\), \((10, 1)\), and \((10, 2)\).

### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing the code and testing with the provided examples, it is clear that the code does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The derived formula and checks do not align with the requirement, and the code may not handle edge cases properly.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**. The code does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) and may not handle edge cases properly.
