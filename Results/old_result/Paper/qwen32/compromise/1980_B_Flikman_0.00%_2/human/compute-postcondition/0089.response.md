Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 998; `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a new list of integers read from the input that must have at least `t + 2` elements; `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`; `value` is `a[t + 1]`; `greater_count` is the total number of elements in the new list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`; if `value` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` is 2 or 4; otherwise, `same_value_count` is 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `same_value_count` has been incremented by 1. If `value` was previously equal to `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` is now 2 or 4. Otherwise, `same_value_count` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
