Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`.**

In simple terms, the value of `favorite_value` has been set to the element at index `f - 1` in the list `a`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a`) retain their initial values.
