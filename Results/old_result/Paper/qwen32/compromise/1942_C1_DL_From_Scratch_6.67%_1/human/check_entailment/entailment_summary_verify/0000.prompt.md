You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        count = 0
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        num = n - list0[-1]
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        print(count + x - 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. It calculates and prints a specific count for each test case based on the differences between consecutive integers in the sorted list and the difference between `n` and the largest integer in the list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and see if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have a regular polygon with `n` sides.
- Bessie has chosen `x` vertices.
- We can choose up to `y` additional vertices (`y=0` in this version).
- We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces formed by drawing diagonals between chosen vertices.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it:
1. Reads `n`, `x`, and `y`.
2. Reads the list of `x` chosen vertices.
3. Sorts the list of chosen vertices.
4. Counts the number of gaps of length 1 between consecutive chosen vertices.
5. Checks if there is a gap of length 1 between the last chosen vertex and the first vertex (considering the polygon is circular).
6. Outputs the count of these gaps plus `x - 2`.

### Key Points:
- The program only considers gaps of length 1 between chosen vertices.
- It assumes that each gap of length 1 can form a triangle with the adjacent vertices.
- It does not consider any other configurations or combinations of vertices that might form triangles.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not account for the possibility of forming triangles using vertices that are not adjacent but still form a valid triangle.
- The program does not consider the circular nature of the polygon properly for all cases.
- The program does not utilize the fact that `y=0` (no additional vertices can be chosen), which means it should only consider the given `x` vertices.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the provided examples and some additional edge cases.

#### Provided Examples:
1. **Test Case 1:**
   ```
   8 4 0
   1 6 2 5
   ```
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - The program outputs `2` (correct).

2. **Test Case 2:**
   ```
   8 8 0
   1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
   ```
   - Expected Output: `6`
   - The program outputs `6` (correct).

3. **Test Case 3:**
   ```
   4 2 0
   1 3
   ```
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - The program outputs `2` (correct).

#### Additional Edge Cases:
1. **Test Case 4:**
   ```
   6 3 0
   1 4 5
   ```
   - Expected Output: `2`
     - Possible triangles: (1, 4, 5) and (1, 5, 6) or (1, 4, 6).
   - The program outputs `1` (incorrect).

2. **Test Case 5:**
   ```
   10 4 0
   1 3 7 9
   ```
   - Expected Output: `3`
     - Possible triangles: (1, 3, 7), (3, 7, 9), and (1, 9, 10).
   - The program outputs `2` (incorrect).

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all possible configurations of vertices that can form triangles. It only counts gaps of length 1, which is not sufficient to maximize the number of triangular pieces in all cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases where non-adjacent vertices can form triangles. It only considers gaps of length 1, which is insufficient to maximize the number of triangular pieces in all scenarios.
