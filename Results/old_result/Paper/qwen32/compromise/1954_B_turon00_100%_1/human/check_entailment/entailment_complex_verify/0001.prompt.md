You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

    #State: The loop has executed `t` times. For each execution, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input. The variable `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`. The variable `cnt` is the length of the longest contiguous subarray starting from `a[0]` that contains only `tmp`. The variable `ans` is the length of the shortest contiguous subarray that contains only `tmp` (or `n` if all elements are `tmp`), updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt` throughout the loop. After processing the entire list `a`, if `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, the output is `-1`. Otherwise, the output is the value of `ans`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then determines the length of the shortest contiguous subarray within `a` that contains only the first element of `a`. If all elements in `a` are the same or if `n` is 1, it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs the length of the shortest such subarray.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be transformed into an array with all identical elements by repeatedly replacing an element \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \) if \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \).

### Key Points

1. **Beautiful Array Definition**: An array is beautiful if, for any index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le |a| - 1 \)), if \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \), you can replace \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \). This operation can be performed any number of times.

2. **Objective**: Determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. If it's impossible to do so, return -1.

3. **Constraints**:
   - The array is already beautiful.
   - The sum of all \( n \) (lengths of arrays across all test cases) does not exceed \( 3 \cdot 10^5 \).

### Program Analysis

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each test case, reading the array, and then trying to find the minimum number of elements to remove. Here's how the code works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `tmp` is set to the first element of the array.
   - `cnt` is initialized to count occurrences of the current sequence of identical elements.
   - `ans` is initialized to the length of the array, representing the worst-case scenario where the entire array needs to be removed.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The code iterates through the array.
   - If the current element matches `tmp`, it increments `cnt`.
   - If the current element does not match `tmp`, it updates `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` and resets `cnt` to 1 (since the current element starts a new sequence).

3. **Final Update**:
   - After the loop, it performs a final update of `ans` to consider the last sequence of identical elements.

4. **Decision**:
   - If the array length is 1 or `ans` equals the array length, it prints `-1` (indicating it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements).
   - Otherwise, it prints `ans` (the minimum number of elements to remove).

### Issues in the Program

The provided program has a fundamental flaw in its logic. The approach of counting sequences of identical elements and finding the minimum sequence length does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Identify the longest sequence of identical elements.
2. If the entire array is a single sequence, return `-1` (impossible to make it non-beautiful).
3. Otherwise, the minimum number of elements to remove is the length of the longest sequence minus 1 (since removing all but one of the longest sequence will ensure the array is no longer beautiful).

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
