Reasoning: The provided program aims to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. The key logic in the program is to find the shortest contiguous subarray that can be removed to disrupt the beautiful property of the array. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
    - `tmp` is initialized to the first element of the array `a`.
    - `cnt` is initialized to count the length of the contiguous subarray starting from `a[0]` that contains only `tmp`.
    - `ans` is initialized to `n` (the length of the array), representing the length of the shortest contiguous subarray that can be removed.

2. **Loop through the array**:
    - For each element in the array, if the element is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is incremented.
    - If the element is not equal to `tmp`, it means the contiguous subarray of `tmp` has ended. The program then updates `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt` and resets `cnt` to 0.

3. **Final update**:
    - After the loop, `ans` is updated one last time to ensure it captures the shortest subarray of `tmp` at the end of the array if all elements were `tmp`.
    - If the length of the array `n` is 1 or if `ans` is equal to `n` (which means all elements in the array are the same), the program outputs `-1` because it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.
    - Otherwise, the program outputs `ans`, which is the length of the shortest contiguous subarray that can be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

4. **Correctness**:
    - The program correctly identifies the shortest contiguous subarray that can be removed to disrupt the beautiful property of the array.
    - The logic handles edge cases, such as when all elements in the array are the same or when the array has only one element.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correctly implementing the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
