Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that `n` ≥ 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input; `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is `min(n, 2)`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0; `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. Since `cnt` can only be 2 or 0 based on the conditions, `ans` will be updated to either `min(n, 2)` if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, or it will remain 0 if `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, and `i` remain unchanged.
