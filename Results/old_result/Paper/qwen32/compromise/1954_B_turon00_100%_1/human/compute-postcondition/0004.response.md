The variable `tmp` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input; `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`.**
