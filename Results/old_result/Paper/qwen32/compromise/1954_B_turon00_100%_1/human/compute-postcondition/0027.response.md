Let's break down the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State
1. **`t`**: An input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
2. **`n`**: An input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5.
3. **`a`**: A list of `n` integers read from the input.
4. **`tmp`**: Equal to `a[0]`.
5. **`cnt`**: The length of the longest contiguous subarray starting from `a[0]` that contains only `tmp`.
6. **`ans`**: The length of the shortest contiguous subarray that contains only `tmp` (or `n` if all elements are `tmp`), updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.
7. **Additional Condition**: `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`.

### Python Code Snippet
```python
print(-1)
```

### Analysis
The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print(-1)` statement. This means that regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `cnt`, and `ans`, the code will always print `-1`.

### Explanation
- The initial state describes the setup of variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions affect the execution of the `print(-1)` statement.
- The statement `print(-1)` is independent of the values of the variables and will always output `-1`.

### Final Output
Output: **-1**
