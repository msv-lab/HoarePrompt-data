Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input; `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`; `cnt` is 0; `ans` is `n`.**

In natural language, the value of `ans` has been set to `n`, while the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.
