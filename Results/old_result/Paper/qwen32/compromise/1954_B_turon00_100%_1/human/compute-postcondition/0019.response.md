The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same as it is the upper bound of the loop.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that `n` ≥ 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input; `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is `n`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0; `i` is 2**
