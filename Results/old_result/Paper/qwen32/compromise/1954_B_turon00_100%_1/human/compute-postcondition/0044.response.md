The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration. Since `n` is already given as greater than 0, it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`**
