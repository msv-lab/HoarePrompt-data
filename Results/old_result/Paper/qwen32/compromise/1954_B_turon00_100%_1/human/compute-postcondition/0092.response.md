Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times. For each execution, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input. The variable `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`. The variable `cnt` is the length of the longest contiguous subarray starting from `a[0]` that contains only `tmp`. The variable `ans` is the length of the shortest contiguous subarray that contains only `tmp` (or `n` if all elements are `tmp`), updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt` throughout the loop. After processing the entire list `a`, if `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, the output is `-1`. Otherwise, the output is the value of `ans`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the loop will have processed `t` different test cases. For each test case, it determines the shortest contiguous subarray of identical elements starting from the first element of the array `a`. If the entire array consists of the same element or if the array has only one element, it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs the length of the shortest contiguous subarray of identical elements.
