The code snippet updates the value of `ans` by taking the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. Given the initial state, `ans` is either `n` or `0` depending on whether `a[i]` is equal to `tmp` or not. `cnt` is either `1` or `0` under the same condition. 

Since `cnt` can only be `0` or `1`, and `ans` starts as either `n` (a positive integer) or `0`, the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt` will be `0` if `cnt` is `0`, and `cnt` (which is `1`) if `ans` is `n` and `cnt` is `1`. However, because `ans` is initially set to `0` when `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, the minimum operation will not change the value of `ans` in that case.

Therefore, the only change that occurs is when `ans` is `n` and `cnt` is `1`, in which case `ans` will be updated to `1`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that `n` ≥ 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input; `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is 1. If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0; `i` is 1**.
