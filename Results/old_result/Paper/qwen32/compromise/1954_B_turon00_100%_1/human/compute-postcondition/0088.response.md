The initial state provides information about several variables (`n`, `_`, `a`, `tmp`, `cnt`, `ans`) and their conditions. However, the `print(-1)` statement does not depend on any of these variables. It directly prints the integer `-1`.

Let's break down the information provided:
- `n` is unchanged.
- `_` is unchanged.
- `a` is unchanged.
- `tmp` is unchanged.
- `cnt` is set to 0.
- `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and `cnt`.
- Either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`.

Despite the conditions and the values of the variables, the `print(-1)` statement will simply output `-1`.

Output: **-1**
