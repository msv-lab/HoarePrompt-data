The code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input; `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`; `cnt` is the length of the longest contiguous subarray starting from `a[0]` that contains only `tmp`; `ans` is the length of the shortest contiguous subarray that contains only `tmp` (or `n` if all elements are `tmp`), updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.**
