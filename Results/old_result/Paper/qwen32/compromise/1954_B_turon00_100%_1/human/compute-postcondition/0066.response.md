The value of `cnt` is reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` is an input integer, `_` is one less than `t`, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, and `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive `tmp` found during the loop or the minimum of its previous value and `cnt` still holds true.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `_` is one less than `t`; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `tmp` is the first element of `a`; `cnt` is 0; `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive `tmp` found during the loop or the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.**
