The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last value it took, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Since the problem statement does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can assume that `i` was the last valid index that allowed the loop to execute. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**

However, since we don't have the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize it as:

State: **`n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**
