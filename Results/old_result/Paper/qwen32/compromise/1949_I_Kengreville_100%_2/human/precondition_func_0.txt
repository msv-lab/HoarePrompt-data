n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i], y[i] are the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk and r[i] is the radius of the i-th disk with -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for each i from 0 to n-1. visited and coef are lists of size n initialized to False and None respectively.
