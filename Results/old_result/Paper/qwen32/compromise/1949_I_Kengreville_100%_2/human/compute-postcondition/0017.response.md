Postcondition: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input, `x` is a list of size `n` with elements set to integers from user input, `y` is a list of size `n` with elements set to integers from user input, `r` is a list of size `n` with elements set to integers from user input, `visited` is a list of size `n` with all elements `True`, `coef` is a list of size `n` with the first element of each connected component set to `1` and others `None` or `1` depending on the `dfs(i)` function, `tot` is the sum of values from the last connected component processed, `bipartite` is `True` if all connected components are bipartite, otherwise `False`. If `ok` is `True`, it indicates that at least one connected component is bipartite and its `tot` is not zero. If `ok` is `False`, it indicates that no connected component is bipartite or the `tot` of all bipartite components is zero.**
