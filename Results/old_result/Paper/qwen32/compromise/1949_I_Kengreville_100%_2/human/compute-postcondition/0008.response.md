Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input, `x` is a list of size `n` with elements set to integers from user input, `y` is a list of size `n` with elements set to integers from user input, `r` is a list of size `n` with elements set to integers from user input, `visited` is a list of size `n` initialized to `False`, `coef` is a list of size `n` with all elements `None`, `tot` is 0.**

In this output state, the only change from the initial state is the introduction of the variable `tot`, which is set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values and states.
