The code snippet provided is a simple `print('YES')` statement. This statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. The initial state provides details about several variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, `ok`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.

Given this, the `print` statement will output the string `'YES'` exactly as it is written.

Output: **YES**
