The code snippet provided is:
```
reachable_second_row = True
```

This line of code assigns the value `True` to the variable `reachable_second_row`. However, it's important to note that the variable `reachable_second_row` already has the value `True` according to the initial state. Therefore, the value of `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged.

The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `row1`, `row2`, `reachable_first_row`, and `j`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 4, `row1` is `"<<"`, `row2` is `">><<"` and `reachable_second_row` is `True`. `reachable_first_row` is `False`. `j` is 4.**
