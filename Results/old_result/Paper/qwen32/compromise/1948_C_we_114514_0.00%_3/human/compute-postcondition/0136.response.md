Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one more tuple after the first one, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then `results` is a list containing the strings 'NO' and 'YES'. If `reachable_second_row` is False, then `results` remains unchanged. `j` is incremented by 1, `reachable_first_row` is False.`**

In simpler terms: The variables `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `row1`, `row2`, `results`, and `j` remain as they were, except `reachable_first_row` is now set to `False`.
