Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one more tuple after the first one, `n` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is False, and `results` is a list containing the strings 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether `reachable_second_row` was True or False.**

In this output state, `reachable_second_row` has been explicitly set to False, while all other variables retain their initial values or states as described. The `results` list will still contain its initial entries, regardless of the change to `reachable_second_row`.
