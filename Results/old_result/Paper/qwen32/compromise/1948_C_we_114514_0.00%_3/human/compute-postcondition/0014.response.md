Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple, e.g., `[(4, "<<>>", ">><<")]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 4, `row1` is `"<<"`, `row2` is `">><<", `reachable_first_row` is `False`, `reachable_second_row` is `True`, `j` is less than `n - 1`, and `row2[j]` is `'>'`. The current value of `row1[j]` is not `'>'`**

In this output state, `reachable_second_row` has been updated to `True`. All other variables retain their initial values.
