Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 4, `row1` is `"<<"`, `row2` is `">><<"` and `reachable_second_row` is `True`. `reachable_first_row` retains its initial value (either `True` or `False`). If `row2[j]` is `'>'`, then the condition specified in the if part holds. Specifically, if `j` is equal to `n - 1` (which means `j` is 3), then the conditions specified in the if part hold.**
