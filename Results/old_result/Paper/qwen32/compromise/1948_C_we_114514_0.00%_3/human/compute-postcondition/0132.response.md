Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one more tuple after the first one, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then `results` is a list containing the strings 'NO' and 'YES'. If `reachable_second_row` is False, then `results` remains unchanged. `j` remains unchanged. If `reachable_second_row` is True and `j` equals `n - 1`, then `row2[j]` is `'>'`.**
