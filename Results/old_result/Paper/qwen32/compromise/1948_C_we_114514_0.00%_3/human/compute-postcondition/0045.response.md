The provided code snippet sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. The initial state specifies that `reachable_second_row` was already `True`, so the assignment does not change its value. Other variables such as `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `row1`, `row2`, `reachable_first_row`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 4, `row1` is `"<<"`, `row2` is `">><<"` and `reachable_second_row` is `True`. `reachable_first_row` is `False` if `row1[j]` is not `'>'` and `j` is not less than `n - 1`, or if `row2[j]` is not `'>'`. Since `j` equals `n - 1`, `reachable_first_row` is updated based on the conditions involving `row1[j]` and `row2[j]`. If `row1[j]` is `'>'`, `reachable_first_row` retains its initial value. `j` is 4. If `reachable_first_row` is `True`, the if part is executed; otherwise, no further change is made to `reachable_first_row`.**
