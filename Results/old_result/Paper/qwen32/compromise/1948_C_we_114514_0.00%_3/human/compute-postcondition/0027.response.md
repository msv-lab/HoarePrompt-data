Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 4, `row1` is `"<<"`, `row2` is `">><<"` and `reachable_second_row` is `True`. `reachable_first_row` retains its initial value (either `True` or `False`). `j` is 4. Since the condition `j == n - 1` is true, no changes are made to the variables other than confirming that `j` is indeed 4.**
