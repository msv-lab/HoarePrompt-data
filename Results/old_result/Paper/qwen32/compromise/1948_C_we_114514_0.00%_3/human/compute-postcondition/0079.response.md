The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is some value (we don't know the exact value, but we know it was less than `n` for the loop to have executed). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 and still be less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is 1
- `test_cases` is a list containing at least two tuples
- `n` is greater than 0
- `row1` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`
- `row2` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases`
- `results` is a list containing the string 'NO'
- If `reachable_second_row` is True, then `reachable_first_row` is True and `row2[j]` is equal to `'>'`. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains False.
- The conditions regarding `row1[j]` and `j` are preserved as specified in the precondition.

At the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least two tuples, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the string 'NO', `j` is incremented by 1**
