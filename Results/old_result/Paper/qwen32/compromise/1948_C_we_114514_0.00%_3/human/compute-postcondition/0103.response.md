To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze how the loop modifies the variables `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` based on the values of `row1` and `row2`.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `reachable_first_row` is `True`.
   - `reachable_second_row` is `False`.

2. **Loop Iterations**:
   - The loop runs `n` times (from `j = 0` to `j = n-1`).

3. **Conditions**:
   - If `reachable_first_row` is `True`:
     - If `row1[j] == '>'`:
       - If `j == n - 1`, set `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
     - If `row1[j] != '>'`:
       - Set `reachable_first_row` to `False`.
       - If `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`, set `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
   - If `reachable_second_row` is `True`:
     - If `row2[j] == '>'`:
       - If `j == n - 1`, set `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
     - Note: The second condition in the second `if` block is redundant because `reachable_second_row` is already `True`.

### Final Output State:
- `reachable_first_row` will be `False` if at any point `row1[j]` is not `'>'` and `j` is not the last index.
- `reachable_second_row` will be `True` if:
  - `row1[n-1]` is `'>'` and `reachable_first_row` remains `True` until the last iteration.
  - Or, if `row2[j]` is `'>'` at any point where `reachable_first_row` is `False` and `j < n-1`.
  - Or, if `row2[n-1]` is `'>'` and `reachable_second_row` becomes `True` at any point before the last iteration.

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop checks each character in `row1` and `row2` from left to right.
- If `reachable_first_row` is `True` and encounters a `'>'` in `row1`, it continues to the next character.
- If it encounters a non-`'>'` character in `row1`, `reachable_first_row` becomes `False`.
- If `reachable_first_row` is `False` and encounters a `'>'` in `row2` before the last character, `reachable_second_row` becomes `True`.
- If `reachable_first_row` is `True` and reaches the last character in `row1` which is `'>'`, `reachable_second_row` becomes `True`.
- If `reachable_second_row` is `True` and encounters a `'>'` in `row2` at any point, it remains `True`.

### Final Output State Based on Analysis:
- After all iterations, `reachable_first_row` will be `False` if any non-`'>'` character is found in `row1` before the last character.
- `reachable_second_row` will be `True` if any of the conditions mentioned above are met.

### Conclusion:
Given the loop's behavior and the provided initial state, the final state will be:

Output State: **t is 1, test_cases is a list containing at least two tuples, n is the first element of the first tuple in test_cases, row1 is the first element of the second tuple in test_cases, row2 is the second element of the second tuple in test_cases, reachable_first_row is False if any non-'>'' in row1 before last, reachable_second_row is True if any of the conditions mentioned above are met, and results is a list containing the string 'NO'.**

However, without specific values of `row1` and `row2`, we can only describe the general conditions under which `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` will be set. If `row1` and `row2` are such that `reachable_first_row` remains `True` until the end and `row1[n-1]` is `'>'`, then `reachable_second_row` will be `True`.

For a concrete example, if `row1` is `'>>>'` and `row2` is `'<<<'`, then:
- `reachable_first_row` will remain `True` until the end.
- `reachable_second_row` will be set to `True` at the last iteration since `row1[n-1]` is `'>'`.

Thus, the final output state would be:

Output State: **t is 1, test_cases is a list containing at least two tuples, n is the first element of the first tuple in test_cases, row1 is the first element of the second tuple in test_cases, row2 is the second element of the second tuple in test_cases, reachable_first_row is True, reachable_second_row is True, and results is a list containing the string 'NO'.**
