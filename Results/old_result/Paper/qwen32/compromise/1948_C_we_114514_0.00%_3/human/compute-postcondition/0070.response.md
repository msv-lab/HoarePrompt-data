Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least two tuples, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, and `results` is a list containing the string 'NO'. If `row1[j]` is equal to `'>'`, then `reachable_second_row` is True if `j` is equal to `n - 1`. If `row1[j]` is not equal to `'>'`, then `reachable_first_row` is False, and `reachable_second_row` is True if `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` is equal to `'>'`, otherwise `reachable_second_row` remains False.**
