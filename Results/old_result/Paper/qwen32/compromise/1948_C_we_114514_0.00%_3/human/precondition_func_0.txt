t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n and two strings of length n, where n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the strings consist only of the characters '<' and '>'. The sum of all n values in test_cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
