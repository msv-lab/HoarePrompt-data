Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to determine if a robot can reach the cell (2, n) from the starting cell (1, 1) by following the arrows in the grid. The logic in `func_1` is intended to simulate the robot's movement based on the rules provided. However, there is a critical flaw in the logic that prevents it from correctly determining the reachability of the target cell.

Here is a breakdown of the issues in the current logic:
1. The program only considers whether the robot can reach the last column (n) in the second row by following '>' characters.
2. It does not account for the possibility of the robot moving up or down between rows based on the arrow directions.
3. The program does not correctly update the state of the robot's position. It only tracks whether the robot can reach the last column in the first row (`reachable_first_row`) and the second row (`reachable_second_row`), but it does not handle the movement between the rows properly.

For example, consider the third test case in the problem statement:
```
4
>>><
>><<
```
The robot can move from (1, 1) to (1, 2) to (1, 3) to (2, 3) and then to (2, 4). However, the current logic would incorrectly determine that the robot cannot reach (2, 4) because it does not correctly handle the down move from (1, 3) to (2, 3).

To fix this, the program needs to correctly simulate the robot's movement, taking into account both the arrow directions and the possibility of moving between rows. The current logic does not do this correctly, resulting in incorrect outputs for some test cases.

Correctness: **False**
