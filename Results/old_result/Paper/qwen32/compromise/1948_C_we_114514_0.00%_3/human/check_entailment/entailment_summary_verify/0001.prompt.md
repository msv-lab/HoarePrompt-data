You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a list of test cases, each consisting of two strings of equal even length containing only '<' and '>'. It determines for each test case whether it is possible to reach the end of the second string starting from the beginning of the first string by following the '>' characters, and returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given Python program is correct, we need to analyze its logic against the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Grid Layout**: The grid has 2 rows and `n` columns.
2. **Robot Movement**: 
   - The robot starts at (1,1).
   - Every second, the robot moves in one of the four cardinal directions (left, right, down, up) and then follows the arrow in the current cell.
   - The robot cannot move outside the grid and cannot skip a move.
3. **Objective**: Determine if the robot can reach the cell (2,n).

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the grid dimensions, the first row, and the second row. It then processes each test case using the `func_1` function.

#### `func_1` Function Breakdown:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `reachable_first_row` is set to `True` because the robot starts on the first row.
   - `reachable_second_row` is set to `False` initially.
2. **Processing Each Column**:
   - For each column `j` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - If `reachable_first_row` is `True`:
       - If the arrow in the first row points to the right (`>`):
         - If `j` is the last column (`n-1`), set `reachable_second_row` to `True` because the robot can reach the destination.
       - If the arrow in the first row points to the left (`<`):
         - Set `reachable_first_row` to `False` because the robot cannot move left from the first column.
         - If `j` is not the last column and the arrow in the second row points to the right (`>`), set `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
     - If `reachable_second_row` is `True`:
       - If the arrow in the second row points to the right (`>`):
         - If `j` is the last column (`n-1`), keep `reachable_second_row` as `True` because the robot has reached the destination.
3. **Result**:
   - If `reachable_second_row` is `True` after processing all columns, append 'YES' to the results list.
   - Otherwise, append 'NO'.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The logic in `func_1` is flawed. The program only considers moving right from the first row to the second row and does not account for the robot's ability to move left, up, or down. It also assumes that the robot can only move right in the second row, which is incorrect. The robot can potentially move left or right in the second row as well.

For example, in the third test case:
- `n = 4`
- `row1 = >>><`
- `row2 = >><<`
The robot can move from (1,1) to (2,1), then to (2,2), then to (1,2), then to (1,3), and finally to (2,3) and (2,4). However, the program will incorrectly output 'NO' because it does not consider the possibility of moving left in the second row.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all possible movements of the robot and thus does not always produce the correct result.

Correctness: **False**
