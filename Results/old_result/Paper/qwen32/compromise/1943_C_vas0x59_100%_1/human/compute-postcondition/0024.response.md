Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that tracks the path taken to reach each vertex from vertex `a`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`.**

In this output state, the variable `b` has been assigned the value returned by `func_1(d)`, which is the same value as `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
