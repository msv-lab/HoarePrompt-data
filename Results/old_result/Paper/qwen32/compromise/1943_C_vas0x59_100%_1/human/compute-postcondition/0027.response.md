The code snippet `n = previous[path_ba[-1]]` updates the variable `n` to be the value of `previous` at the index specified by the last element of `path_ba`. Given that `path_ba` contains the single element `b`, this means `n` is updated to `previous[b]`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that tracks the path taken to reach each vertex from vertex `a`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`; `n` is `previous[b]`.**
