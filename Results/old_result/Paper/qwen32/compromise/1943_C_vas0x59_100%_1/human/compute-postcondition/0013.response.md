The code snippet `u2vs[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list at index `v` in the list `u2vs`. Given the initial state, the list at index `v` originally contains the values `[v, v]`. After appending `u`, the list at index `v` will be `[v, v, u]`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` contains the values `[v, v]`, the list at index `v` contains the values `[v, v, u]`, and the list at index `w` (for all other `w` not equal to `u` or `v`) contains the values `[w, w]`; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `u` is the input integer decremented by 1; `v` is the input integer decremented by 2 such that `0 <= v - 1 < n-1`.**
