The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. The initial state describes `u` and `v` as integers representing vertices connected by an edge with specific constraints. After executing the code, the values of `u` and `v` are updated to the integers provided by the input.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` contains the value `v`, and the list at index `v` contains two values `u`, and all other lists remain empty; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `u` and `v` are the integers read from the input such that `0 <= u < n` (after decrementing by 1) and `0 <= v < n-1`.**
