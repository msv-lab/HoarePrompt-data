The given initial state specifies that `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers within the range [0, n-1], where `n` is the length of a secret permutation `p`. The `print` statement will output a string starting with `'?'` followed by the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not provided, we can only describe them in terms of the given constraints. Therefore, the output will be a string with the question mark followed by these four integers, each of which is within the range [0, n-1].

Output: **? [a] [b] [c] [d] (where a, b, c, and d are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n)**
