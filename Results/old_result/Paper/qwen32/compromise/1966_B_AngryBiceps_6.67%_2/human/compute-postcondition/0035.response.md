The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last string in the list `a` to the `last_row` string. Initially, `last_row` is an empty string, and `a` contains one element, which is an input string. Therefore, `a[-1][-1]` refers to the last character of this input string. After executing the code, `last_row` will hold this last character.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing one element (the input string), `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a`, `i` is `n-1`.**
