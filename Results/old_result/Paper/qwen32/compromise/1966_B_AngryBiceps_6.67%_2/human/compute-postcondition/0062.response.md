The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last string in the list `a` to `last_row`. Given that `a` is a list containing one input string, `a[-1]` refers to that single string, and `a[-1][-1]` refers to the last character of that string. Therefore, `last_row` will now hold this last character.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing one input string, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a`, `i` is 0**.
