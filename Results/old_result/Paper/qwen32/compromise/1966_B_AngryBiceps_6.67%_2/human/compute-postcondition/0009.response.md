The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing one input string, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a`, `i` is 1**
