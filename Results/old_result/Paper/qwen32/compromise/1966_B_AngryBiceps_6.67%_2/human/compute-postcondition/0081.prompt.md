Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 500. The grid is represented by n lines, each containing m characters which are either 'W' or 'B'. The sum of n*m over all test cases does not exceed 3*10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = []
    first_row = ''
    last_row = ''
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(input())
        first_row += a[-1][0]
        last_row += a[-1][-1]
    if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
        print('NO')
    elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings, `first_row` is a string containing the first characters of each of the `n` strings in `a` concatenated together, `last_row` is a string containing the last characters of each of the `n` strings in `a` concatenated together, `i` is `n-1`. If the first string in `a` consists of identical characters and is not equal to the last string in `a`, then the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, either the length of the set of characters in `a[0]` is not equal to 1, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`. Additionally, either the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not equal to 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is an input string), `first_row` is the concatenation of the first characters of each string in `a`, and `last_row` is the concatenation of the last characters of each string in `a`. `i` is `n-1`. If the first string in `a` consists of identical characters and is not the same as the last string in `a`, then the condition in the if part holds. Otherwise, either the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not equal to 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings, `first_row` is a string of length `n` consisting of the first characters of each string in `a`, and `last_row` is a string of length `n` consisting of the last characters of each string in `a`. `i` is `n-1`. If the first string in `a` consists of identical characters and is not equal to the last string in `a`, then the condition is met as specified in the if part. Otherwise, either the first string in `a` does not consist of identical characters or it is equal to the last string in `a`. Additionally, if the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is 1, then `first_row` is equal to `last_row`. Otherwise, the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not equal to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
