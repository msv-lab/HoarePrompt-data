The code snippet `n //= 2` modifies the value of `n` by performing integer division by 2. This means `n` is updated to be the floor division of its current value by 2.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 5 * 10^4 - 1
- `n` must be a non-zero integer
- `k` is the second input integer
- `s` is 0
- `m` is 1
- `_` is 1
- `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`

After the execution of `n //= 2`, the value of `n` changes, but all other variables remain the same. Specifically, `n` is now `n // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 5 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is `n // 2`; `k` is the second input integer; `s` is 0; `m` is 1; `_` is 1; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
