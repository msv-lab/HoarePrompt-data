Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 5 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is `n // 2`; `k` is the second input integer; `s` is 0; `m` is 1; `_` is 1; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`. If `s` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `s + x`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
