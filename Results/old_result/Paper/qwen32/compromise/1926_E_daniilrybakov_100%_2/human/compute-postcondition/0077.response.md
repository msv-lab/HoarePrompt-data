The code snippet `x = (n + 1) // 2` reassigns the value of `x` to `(n + 1) // 2`. Given the initial state, `x` is already defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, so the value of `x` remains unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 5 * 10^4 - 1; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is the second input integer; `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 2`; `m` is 4; `_` is 1; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
