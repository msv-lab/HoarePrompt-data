To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head. The given `while` loop is:

```python
while n:
    # the loop body is omit
```

In Python, a non-zero integer is considered `True` in a boolean context, and a zero is considered `False`. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `n` is not zero.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `s` is 0
- `m` is 1

To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must not be zero. Since `n` is an input integer, we need to specify that `n` should be a non-zero value.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n` is a non-zero integer; `k` is an input integer; `s` is 0; `m` is 1**
