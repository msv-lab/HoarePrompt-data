The code snippet `m *= 2` multiplies the current value of `m` by 2. Given that the initial value of `m` is 4, after executing the code, `m` will be 8. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n` is `n // 2`; `k` is an input integer; `s` is `2*((n // 2) + 1) // 2 + ((n // 2) + 1) // 2`; `m` is 8; `x` is `((n // 2) + 1) // 2`.**
