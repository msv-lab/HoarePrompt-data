To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the initial state and understand how the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `m` are defined and used in the context provided.

Given:
- `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 5 * 10^4 - 1.
- `n` is initialized to 0.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `s` is the sum of all `(n_i + 1) // 2` values where `n_i` is the value of `n` at each iteration.
- `m` is 2 raised to the power of the number of iterations the loop executed.

However, the code snippet provided does not include a loop, so we need to infer the loop structure from the description of `s` and `m`.

Let's assume there is a loop that runs `t` times, and in each iteration:
- `n` is incremented by some value (not specified).
- `s` accumulates the value of `(n_i + 1) // 2` where `n_i` is the value of `n` at the start of each iteration.
- `m` is calculated as 2 raised to the power of the number of iterations, which is `t`.

So, after `t` iterations:
- `s` will be the sum of `(n_i + 1) // 2` for each `n_i` from the initial value of `n` (which is 0) to the value of `n` at the end of each iteration.
- `m` will be `2^t`.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:
```
print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)
```

To determine the output, we need to know the values of `k`, `s`, and `m`:
- `k` is an input integer.
- `s` is the sum of `(n_i + 1) // 2` for each iteration.
- `m` is `2^t`.

Since the exact values of `n_i` at each iteration are not provided, we can't compute the exact value of `s`. However, we can express the output in terms of `k`, `s`, and `m`.

The final output will be:
Output: **(2 * (k - s) - 1) * 2^t (where s is the sum of (n_i + 1) // 2 for each iteration from 0 to t-1, and m is 2^t)**
