Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n` is a non-zero integer and was previously updated to `n // 2`; `k` is an input integer; `s` is `x`; `m` is 1; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` was updated. If `s` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `s + x`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables after the if-else block.**

In simple terms, the value of `s` is now equal to `x`, and all other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
