Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the k-th card Vladislav lays down based on the described process. It efficiently handles the large input constraints by leveraging the properties of odd numbers and multiples, ensuring that it can compute the result within acceptable time limits even for the maximum input size.
