You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 0
        m = 1
        while n:
            x = (n + 1) // 2
            n //= 2
            if s < k and k <= s + x:
                break
            s += x
            m *= 2
        print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k` (where `1 <= k <= n <= 10^9`). For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific integer value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
Vladislav lays down cards in a specific sequence:
1. First, all odd-numbered cards in ascending order.
2. Then, all cards that are twice an odd number in ascending order.
3. Then, all cards that are three times an odd number in ascending order.
4. This pattern continues until all cards are laid down.

The task is to find the k-th card in this sequence.

### Program Analysis
The program reads t test cases, each containing n (the total number of cards) and k (the position of the card to find). It then calculates the k-th card using the following logic:

1. Initialize `s` (sum of cards laid so far) to 0 and `m` (multiplier for the current group) to 1.
2. In a loop, calculate `x`, the number of cards in the current group (odd numbers, then twice odd numbers, etc.).
3. Reduce `n` by half (since half of the cards are odd, then half of the remaining are twice odd, and so on).
4. Check if `k` falls within the range of the current group (`s < k <= s + x`). If it does, break the loop.
5. If not, add `x` to `s` and multiply `m` by 2 to move to the next group.
6. Once the correct group is found, calculate the k-th card using the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.

### Verification
Let's verify this logic with the example provided:

For `n = 7` and `k = 1` to `7`:
- Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7 (4 cards)
- Twice odd numbers: 2, 6 (2 cards)
- Four times odd numbers: 4 (1 card)

The sequence is: 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4.

Let's check the program's output for these cases:
- For `k = 1`, the program outputs `1` (correct).
- For `k = 2`, the program outputs `3` (correct).
- For `k = 3`, the program outputs `5` (correct).
- For `k = 4`, the program outputs `7` (correct).
- For `k = 5`, the program outputs `2` (correct).
- For `k = 6`, the program outputs `6` (correct).
- For `k = 7`, the program outputs `4` (correct).

For other test cases, the program seems to follow the same logic and produces the correct output.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to find the k-th card in the sequence as described in the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
