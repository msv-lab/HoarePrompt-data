Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to simulate a game where Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to an array `c`. Alice aims to maximize the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it. The goal is to determine the MEX of `c` when both players play optimally.

### Key Points:
1. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
2. **Optimal Play**: Alice and Bob play optimally, meaning they make moves that maximize or minimize the MEX, respectively.
3. **Game Dynamics**: Alice starts by picking an element, appends it to `c`, and removes it from `a`. Bob then picks an element and removes it from `a`. This continues until `a` is empty.

### Strategy:
- The optimal strategy for Alice is to try to include as many unique elements as possible in `c` to maximize the MEX.
- Bob's strategy is to prevent Alice from adding unique elements, thus minimizing the MEX.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve the problem as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
3. It then calls the function `func_1(arr)` which calculates the MEX of the array `arr` based on the frequencies of elements.

#### Function `func_1(arr)`:
1. It initializes a frequency array `freq` of size `n+1` to count occurrences of each element in `arr`.
2. It counts the frequency of each element in `arr`.
3. It iterates through the frequency array to find the smallest index `i` such that `freq[i]` is either 0 or 1 (indicating that `i` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `arr` or appears only once).
4. It prints this index `i` as the MEX.

### Correctness Check:
- The program correctly counts the frequency of each element in `arr`.
- The program correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer that is either not present in `arr` or appears only once, which is the MEX.
- The program assumes that the optimal play strategy is inherently handled by the MEX calculation, which is correct because the MEX is a direct result of the unique elements and their frequencies in `arr`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the MEX of the array `arr` based on the frequencies of elements, which is the optimal result for the game when both players play optimally.

**Correctness: True**
