The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` where each integer is between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), with `n` being the length of the list. It prints the smallest integer that either appears exactly once in `arr` or does not appear at all, stopping after finding the second unique element or encountering a zero frequency element.
