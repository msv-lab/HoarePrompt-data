The code snippet provided modifies the value of `ans[i + 1]` by adding the value of `ans[i]` to it. This means that the value of `ans[i + 1]` will be updated to its previous value plus the value of `ans[i]`.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 500.
- The length of `arr` is `n-1`.
- `t` is the number of test cases where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- The sum of all `n` across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
- `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is `arr[i] + 3 * ans[i]`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`.
- `arr[i + 2]` is at least `ans[i + 2]`.

The code snippet provided modifies `ans[i + 1]` by adding `ans[i]` to it. Therefore, the new value of `ans[i + 1]` will be `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 500, the length of `arr` is `n-1`, `t` is the number of test cases where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, the sum of all `n` across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]` (previously `arr[i] + 3 * ans[i]`), `i` is `i + 1`, `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`, and `arr[i + 2]` is at least `ans[i + 2]`.**
