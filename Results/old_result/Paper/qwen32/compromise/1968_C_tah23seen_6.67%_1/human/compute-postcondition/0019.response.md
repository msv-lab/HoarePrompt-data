To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop: `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`. The loop will continue to execute as long as this condition is true.

Given the current state:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 500.
- The length of `arr` is `n-1`.
- `t` is the number of test cases where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- The sum of all `n` across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
- `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is `arr[i] + 3 * ans[i]`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`.
- `arr[i + 1]` is at least `ans[i + 1]`.

The loop condition is `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`. For the loop to execute one more time, this condition must be true. Therefore, we need to ensure that `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

Given that `arr[i + 1]` is at least `ans[i + 1]` (from the problem statement), the condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` is already satisfied. No further adjustment is needed to ensure the loop condition holds true.

However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the next iteration where `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `ans[i + 2] <= arr[i + 2]` for the next iteration.

To satisfy this, we can adjust `arr[i + 2]` to be at least `ans[i + 2]`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 500, the length of `arr` is `n-1`, `t` is the number of test cases where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, the sum of all `n` across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is `arr[i] + 3 * ans[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`, and `arr[i + 2]` is at least `ans[i + 2]`**.
