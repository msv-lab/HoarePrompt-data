The given code snippet updates the `ans` list by adding the value of `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1]`. Let's break down the impact of this operation on the initial state.

Initial State:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 500.
- The length of `arr` is `n-1`.
- `t` is the number of test cases where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- The sum of all `n` across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
- `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and `ans[i + 1]` is the cumulative sum of `arr[i] + ans[i]` for i in the range from 0 to `n-2`.
- `arr[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `ans[i + 1]`.

The code snippet provided is:
```
ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
```

This line of code modifies `ans[i + 1]` by adding `ans[i]` to it. This means that the value of `ans[i + 1]` will be updated to `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 500; the length of `arr` is `n-1`; `t` is the number of test cases where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; the sum of all `n` across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and `ans[i + 1]` is the cumulative sum of `arr[i] + ans[i]` for i in the range from 0 to `n-2`, and `ans[i + 1]` has been updated to `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`; `arr[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to the updated `ans[i + 1]`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans[i + 1]` has been increased by adding `ans[i]` to it, while all other conditions and values remain the same.
