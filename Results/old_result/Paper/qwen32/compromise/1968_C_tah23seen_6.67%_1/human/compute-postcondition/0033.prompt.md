Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500, `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the resulting array a_1, ..., a_n such that 2 <= n <= 500, the length of `arr` is n-1, `t` is the number of test cases where 1 <= t <= 10^4, and the sum of all n across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros where the first element `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2):
    ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
    if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
        while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
            ans[i + 1] += ans[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 500, the length of `arr` is `n-1`, `t` is the number of test cases where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, and the sum of all `n` across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]` of the form `arr[i] + k * ans[i]` where `k` is a positive integer. If `ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]`, then `ans[i + 1]` is updated to the smallest integer greater than `arr[i + 1]` of the form `arr[i] + k * ans[i]`. Otherwise, `ans[i + 1]` remains as `arr[i] + ans[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]` that can be expressed as `arr[i] + k * ans[i]` for some integer `k`. If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, it is updated to the smallest value greater than `arr[i + 1]` that can be expressed as `arr[i] + k * ans[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and if `ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]`, then `ans[1]` is the smallest value greater than `arr[1]` that can be expressed as `2 * arr[0] + 1 + k * (arr[0] + 1)` for some integer `k`. Otherwise, `ans[i + 1]` remains as `arr[i] + ans[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
