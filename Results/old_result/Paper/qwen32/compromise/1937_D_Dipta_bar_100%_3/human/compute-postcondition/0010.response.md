The code snippet calculates the length of the list `B` and assigns it to the variable `r`. The length of `B` is 2 because `B` is `[0, 2]`. The other variables (`s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, `idx_B`, and `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` remains unchanged; `n` remains unchanged; `A` contains the cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '>' characters; `idx_A` contains the indices of '>' characters; `B = [0, 2]`; `idx_B = [4, 2]`; `l = 0`; `r = 2`.**
