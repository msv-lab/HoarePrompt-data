The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The current state of `s`, `A`, and `idx_A` does not affect whether the loop will execute, so we do not need to adjust those.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be initialized to 0, which is the starting point of the range in the loop.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is an empty list, `idx_A` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
