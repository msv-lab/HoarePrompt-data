Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are the main problems:

1. **Function Definition and Usage**: The function `func_1(s)` is defined but never actually used correctly. Instead, the code directly calls `func_1(s)` without handling its return value or output format properly. The function `func_1(s)` should be designed to return the results for each query and then printed in the main loop.

2. **Logic for Pinball Movement**: The logic within `func_1(s)` is complex and seems to be attempting to optimize the calculation of the number of steps for each pinball by using precomputed arrays `A` and `B`. However, the logic is not straightforward and may contain errors or edge cases that are not handled correctly.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases such as:
   - A grid with all '<' or all '>'.
   - A grid where the pinball might immediately leave the grid (e.g., a single character grid with '>' or '<').

4. **Output Formatting**: The code uses `print()` statements without proper formatting, which may lead to incorrect output formatting as required by the problem description.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
3
><<
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3 6 5
```

The provided code might not handle this test case correctly due to the issues mentioned above. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To fix the program, one would need to ensure that:
- The function `func_1(s)` correctly computes the number of steps for each pinball and returns the results.
- The main loop correctly handles the input and output formatting.
- The logic within `func_1(s)` is correct and handles all edge cases properly.
