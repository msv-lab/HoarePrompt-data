To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem described. The problem involves simulating the movement of a pinball on a grid with specific rules and calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid and the grid itself.
   - The program then calls `func_1(s)` for each test case to compute the time for each starting position.

2. **Logic in `func_1(s)`:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - Two lists, `A` and `B`, are initialized to store cumulative times for pinballs moving right and left, respectively.
     - Two index lists, `idx_A` and `idx_B`, are used to keep track of positions where '>' and '<' are encountered.
   
   - **Processing Right Movements:**
     - It iterates over the grid to find all '>' characters.
     - For each '>', it calculates the cumulative time it would take for a pinball to reach this position from the previous '>' and adds this to list `A`.
     - The position of the '>' is stored in `idx_A`.
   
   - **Processing Left Movements:**
     - It iterates over the grid in reverse to find all '<' characters.
     - For each '<', it calculates the cumulative time it would take for a pinball to reach this position from the previous '<' and adds this to list `B`.
     - The position of the '<' is stored in `idx_B`.
   
   - **Calculating Output:**
     - For each position in the grid:
       - If the character is '>', it calculates the total time to leave the grid considering both right and left movements.
       - If the character is '<', it similarly calculates the total time to leave the grid.
     - The results are printed for each starting position.

### Correctness Verification:
- The logic for calculating cumulative times and handling the inversion of characters after each move seems complex and potentially incorrect. The provided code does not seem to account for the inversion of characters correctly and does not correctly handle the movement of the pinball in a way that matches the problem's rules.
- The program's approach of using cumulative times and indices might not correctly simulate the exact movement and inversion process described in the problem statement.
- The code does not provide a clear and straightforward simulation of the pinball's movement and inversion process, which is crucial for solving the problem.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity and the way the program attempts to simulate the pinball's movement and inversion, it is likely that the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic seems flawed, and the program does not provide a clear, step-by-step simulation of the pinball's movement and the inversion of characters.

**Correctness: False**
