Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of times the substrings 'map' or 'pie' appear in `s`, excluding the occurrences where 'mapie' appears as a substring.**
