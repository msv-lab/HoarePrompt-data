The code snippet updates the `residue_map` dictionary by incrementing the count for the key `(arr[0] % x, arr[0] % y)` by 1. Since this is the first time the key is being added, it will be set to 1.

Here are the variables that remain unchanged:
- `test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must contain at least one test case.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `count` is 0.
- `arr` is the list of integers from the first test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least one integer.
- `r_x` is `-arr[0] % x`.
- `r_y` is `arr[0] % y`.
- `current_key` is `(arr[0] % x, arr[0] % y)`.

The only variable that changes is `residue_map`, which now contains the key `(arr[0] % x, arr[0] % y)` with a value of 1.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must contain at least one test case; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `arr` is the list of integers from the first test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least one integer; `r_x` is `-arr[0] % x`; `r_y` is `arr[0] % y`; `current_key` is `(arr[0] % x, arr[0] % y)`; `residue_map` is `{(arr[0] % x, arr[0] % y): 1}`.**
