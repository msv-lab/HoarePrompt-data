The provided Python code snippet updates the `residue_map` dictionary by incrementing the count for the `current_key`. Here's the breakdown of the changes:

- `residue_map[current_key]` is incremented by 1. If `current_key` does not exist in `residue_map`, it is initialized to 0 before incrementing.

The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `r_x`, `r_y`, `num`) remain unchanged by this specific line of code.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must contain at least one more test case, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is updated to `count + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next test case in `test_cases` with `arr` containing at least two elements, `residue_map` is updated with `current_key` incremented by 1, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, `num` is the next element in `arr`.**
