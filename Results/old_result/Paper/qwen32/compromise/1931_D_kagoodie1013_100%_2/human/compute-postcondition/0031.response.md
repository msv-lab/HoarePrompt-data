The code snippet assigns the value of the tuple `(num % x, num % y)` to the variable `current_key`. The values of `test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `residue_map` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must contain at least one more test case, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is `count + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next test case in `test_cases` with `arr` containing at least one element, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`**.
