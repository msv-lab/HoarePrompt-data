To ensure the for loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is `num` and `arr`. The loop will execute if `arr` contains at least one element. 

Let's break down the state and identify the necessary adjustments:

- `test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must contain at least one more test case.
- `results` is a list containing the value of `count`.
- `count` is 0.
- `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next test case in `test_cases`.
- `residue_map` is an empty dictionary.

The loop `for num in arr:` will execute if `arr` has at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `arr` is not empty.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must contain at least one more test case, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is 0, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next test case in `test_cases` with `arr` containing at least one element, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary**

This ensures that the for loop will execute as `arr` has at least one element to iterate over.
