The code snippet provided updates the `residue_map` dictionary by incrementing the count of the `current_key` by 1. The `current_key` is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)`, which is used as a key in the `residue_map` dictionary. If the `current_key` does not exist in the dictionary, it is added with a value of 1. If it already exists, its value is incremented by 1.

Given the initial state, the only variable that is explicitly updated by the code is `residue_map`. The values of `test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `r_x`, `r_y`, and `num` remain unchanged in terms of their specific values or expressions as provided in the initial state.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions containing at least one more test case; `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `count` is updated to `count + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next test case in `test_cases` with `arr` containing at least one more element; `residue_map` is updated with `current_key` incremented by 1; `r_x` is `-num % x`; `r_y` is `num % y`; `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`; `num` is the next element in `arr`.**
