The code snippet assigns the value of the tuple `(num % x, num % y)` to the variable `current_key`. The values of `num`, `x`, and `y` are used to compute the elements of the tuple, but these values do not change. The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `n`, `arr`, `residue_map`, `r_x`, and `r_y`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions containing at least one more test case; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` from the current test case; `count` is `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next test case in `test_cases` with `arr` containing at least one element; `residue_map` is an empty dictionary; `r_x` is `-num % x`; `r_y` is `num % y`; `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`**.
