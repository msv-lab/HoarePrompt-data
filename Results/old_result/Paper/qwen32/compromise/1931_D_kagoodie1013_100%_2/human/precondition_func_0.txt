test_cases is a list of test case descriptions. Each test case description is a tuple containing three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers (a). Here, n is the size of the array (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), x and y are Polycarp's favorite integers (1 <= x, y <= 10^9), and a is the list of integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The length of the test_cases list is t (1 <= t <= 10^4), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
