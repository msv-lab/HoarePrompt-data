You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of integers \( n \), \( x \), \( y \), and a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). For each test case, it calculates a count based on specific residue conditions related to \( x \) and \( y \) and the elements in \( a \). The function returns a list of these counts, one for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
We need to find pairs of indices (i, j) in the array such that:
1. \( a_i + a_j \) is divisible by \( x \).
2. \( a_i - a_j \) is divisible by \( y \).

### Conditions Analysis:
Let's restate the conditions in terms of modular arithmetic:
1. \( a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \ (\text{mod} \ x) \) which implies \( a_i \equiv -a_j \ (\text{mod} \ x) \).
2. \( a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \ (\text{mod} \ y) \) which implies \( a_i \equiv a_j \ (\text{mod} \ y) \).

This means for a pair (i, j) to be beautiful:
- \( a_i \equiv -a_j \ (\text{mod} \ x) \)
- \( a_i \equiv a_j \ (\text{mod} \ y) \)

### Program Analysis:
The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of pairs of residues:
- `r_x` is the residue of `-num` modulo `x`.
- `r_y` is the residue of `num` modulo `y`.

For each number `num` in the array:
- It calculates `r_x` and `r_y`.
- It checks how many pairs `(r_x, r_y)` have been seen before and adds this count to the total number of beautiful pairs.
- It then updates the `residue_map` with the current residue pair `(num % x, num % y)`.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs. Here's why:
- It correctly calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y` for each number.
- It uses a dictionary to keep track of the counts of these residue pairs, which allows it to efficiently count the number of beautiful pairs as it iterates through the array.
- The program handles multiple test cases correctly by iterating through the test cases and processing each one independently.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
