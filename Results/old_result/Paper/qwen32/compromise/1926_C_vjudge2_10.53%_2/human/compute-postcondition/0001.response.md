The code snippet initializes an empty list named `numbers`. The variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases, remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is that `t` still holds its initial value, and `numbers` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numbers` is an empty list.**
