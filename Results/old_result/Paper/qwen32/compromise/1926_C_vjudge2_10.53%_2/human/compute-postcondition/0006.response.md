The code snippet provided initializes a variable `total` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `numbers`, `values`, or `sum_values`. Therefore, the Output State remains with `total` being 0, and all other variables retaining their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each read from the input; `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with all elements initialized to 0; `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with all elements initialized to 0; `total` is 0.**
