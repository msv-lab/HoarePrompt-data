### Reasoning:

The given Python program is intended to solve the problem by calculating the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n` for multiple test cases. The program uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the sum of the digits for each integer up to the maximum `n` encountered in the test cases.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then reads `t` integers `n`, each representing the upper limit of the range for a test case.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - `values` array is initialized to store the sum of the digits for each integer from 0 to the maximum `n` encountered.
   - `sum_values` array is initialized to store the cumulative sum of the `values` array up to each integer.
   - `total` is initialized to keep track of the cumulative sum of the digits for integers from 1 to 9.

3. **Base Case:**
   - For integers from 0 to 9, the sum of the digits is the integer itself. This is correctly handled by initializing `values[i] = i` for `i` from 0 to 9.
   - The cumulative sum `sum_values` is also initialized accordingly.

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - For integers from 10 to `n`, the sum of the digits is calculated using the previously computed values.
   - For an integer `i`, it is split into its last digit `last` and the remaining part `remainder`.
   - The sum of the digits of `i` is then `values[last] + values[remainder]`.
   - The cumulative sum `sum_values` is updated accordingly.

5. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the cumulative sum of the digits from 1 to `n` using the `sum_values` array.

### Issues in the Provided Code:
- The loop `for i in range(10, n + 1):` should iterate up to the maximum `n` encountered, not a fixed `n`. This should be `for i in range(10, max(numbers) + 1):`.
- The variable `n` in the dynamic programming loop is not defined in that scope. It should be replaced with `max(numbers)`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        numbers.append(n)
    max_n = max(numbers)
    values = [0 for _ in range(max_n + 1)]
    sum_values = [0 for _ in range(max_n + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        total += i
        sum_values[i] = total
    for i in range(10, max_n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])

func_1()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided code has a small issue with the loop range and variable scope. Once corrected, the program should work as intended. Therefore, the original code is incorrect due to these issues.

Correctness: **False**
