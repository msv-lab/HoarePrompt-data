Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for certain cases. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the `sum_values` array, which is supposed to store the cumulative sum of the digit sums up to each number. The main issues are:

1. **Incorrect Loop Range**: The loop that calculates `values` and `sum_values` runs only up to `n`, which is the maximum number in the input list. However, this `n` is not defined outside the loop, and `n` inside the loop is the current test case number. This means the loop only runs up to the first test case number, which is incorrect if the subsequent test case numbers are larger.

2. **Incorrect `sum_total` Calculation**: The variable `sum_total` is used incorrectly. It should be `sum_values[i]` instead of `sum_total`.

3. **Incorrect Loop Range for Test Cases**: The loop that calculates `values` and `sum_values` should run up to the maximum number across all test cases, not just the first one.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        numbers.append(n)
    max_n = max(numbers)
    values = [0 for _ in range(max_n + 1)]
    sum_values = [0 for _ in range(max_n + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        total += i
        sum_values[i] = total
    for i in range(10, max_n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        last = int(word[-1])
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        sum_values[i] = sum_values[i - 1] + values[i]
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])

func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that the `values` and `sum_values` arrays are computed correctly for the maximum number across all test cases, ensuring that the program works correctly for every potential case.
