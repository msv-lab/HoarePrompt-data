Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program includes a function `func_1()` that is called at the beginning, but the function itself is not properly defined to handle the input and output for all test cases correctly. Specifically, the variable `n` in the second loop is not defined in the scope of that loop, which will lead to a `NameError`. It should use `max(numbers)` instead of `n` in the range of the second loop.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        numbers.append(n)
    max_n = max(numbers)
    values = [0 for _ in range(max_n + 1)]
    sum_values = [0 for _ in range(max_n + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        total += i
        sum_values[i] = total
    for i in range(10, max_n + 1):  # Use max_n instead of n
        word = str(i)
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])

func_1()
```

This corrected version should work as intended.
