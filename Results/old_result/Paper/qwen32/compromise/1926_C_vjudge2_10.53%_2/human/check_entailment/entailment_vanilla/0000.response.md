Let's carefully examine the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input:**
   - The first line contains the number of test cases, `t`.
   - Each of the next `t` lines contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5).
   
2. **Process:**
   - For each integer `n`, replace each integer from 1 to `n` with the sum of its digits.
   - Calculate the sum of these new values.
   
3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output the sum of the numbers after the replacement.

### Program Analysis
The program follows these steps:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then reads each of the `t` integers `n` and stores them in a list `numbers`.

2. **Pre-computation:**
   - It creates two lists: `values` and `sum_values`, both of size `max(numbers) + 1`.
   - `values[i]` will store the sum of the digits of the number `i`.
   - `sum_values[i]` will store the cumulative sum of `values[j]` for `j` from 1 to `i`.

3. **Initialization:**
   - For numbers 0 to 9, it initializes `values[i]` to `i` (since the sum of the digits of a single-digit number is the number itself).
   - It also initializes `sum_values[i]` to the cumulative sum of `values[j]` up to `i`.

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - For numbers 10 to `n`, it calculates `values[i]` by splitting `i` into its last digit and the remainder, and then summing the `values` of these two parts.
   - It updates `sum_values[i]` to be the cumulative sum up to `i`.

5. **Output:**
   - For each `n` in the list `numbers`, it prints `sum_values[n]`, which is the sum of the digit sums from 1 to `n`.

### Issues in the Program
- The program initializes `sum_values` and `values` up to `max(numbers) + 1`, but it uses `n` in the loop `for i in range(10, n + 1):`, which could lead to an `IndexError` if `n` is larger than the maximum value in `numbers` for some test cases.
- The program should use `max(numbers)` instead of `n` in the loop to ensure it doesn't go out of bounds.
- The function `func_1()` is defined but not used correctly. The program should call `func_1()` after defining it, or the code should be moved outside the function definition.

### Correctness
Despite the issues mentioned, the logic of the program is correct, and with the necessary corrections, it would produce the correct output. However, as it stands, the program is incorrect due to the potential `IndexError` and the improper function call.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
