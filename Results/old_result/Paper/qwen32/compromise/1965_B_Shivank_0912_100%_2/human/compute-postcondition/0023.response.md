To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the `ans` list.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs for `j` from `0` to `19` (20 iterations).
- For each iteration, if `j` is not equal to `i` (where `i = floor(log2(k))`), the value `1 << j` is appended to the `ans` list.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is an integer.
- `k` is unchanged.
- `i` is \(\lfloor \log_2(k) \rfloor\).
- `ans` is initially \([k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]\).

### Iteration Details:
- In each iteration, if `j` is not equal to `i`, `1 << j` is appended to `ans`.
- Since `i` is a specific value between `0` and `9` (inclusive) based on the value of `k`, there will be exactly one iteration (`j = i`) where no new element is added to `ans`.

### Final State:
- The loop runs 20 times, but only 19 of these times will append a new element to `ans` because one iteration (`j = i`) does not append anything.
- Therefore, `ans` will end up with the initial three elements plus 19 additional elements, making a total of 22 elements.

### Calculation:
- The initial `ans` list has 3 elements.
- For each `j` from `0` to `19` except `i`, `1 << j` is appended to `ans`.
- Thus, `ans` will contain:
  - The initial three elements: `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`
  - Plus 19 elements: `[1 << 0, 1 << 1, ..., 1 << (i-1), 1 << (i+1), ..., 1 << 19]`

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `k` remains the same.
- `i` remains the same.
- `ans` will be `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << 0, 1 << 1, ..., 1 << (i-1), 1 << (i+1), ..., 1 << 19]`.

Output State: **[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]** (excluding `1 << i`)

In natural language, the final output state is that `ans` contains the initial three elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` followed by the powers of 2 from `1` to `131072`, excluding `1 << i`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`) remain unchanged.
