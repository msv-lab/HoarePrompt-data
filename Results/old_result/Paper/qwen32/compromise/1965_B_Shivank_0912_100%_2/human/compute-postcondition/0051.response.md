The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means the values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the input provided. The initial state mentions a list of values excluding \(2^i\) and the variable `tc` which is set to 1. Since `n` and `k` are being reassigned, their values in the initial state are irrelevant and will be replaced by the new input values.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, the list [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072] excluding \(2^i\) remains unchanged, `tc` is 1**.
