To determine the output of the `print(*ans)` statement, we need to understand the context and the variables involved. The initial state provides us with a list of specific values:

\[ \text{List} = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072] \]

However, the variable `ans` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, we must assume that `ans` is intended to refer to this list or some subset of it. Given the format of the `print(*ans)` statement, it suggests that `ans` is a list or iterable that will be unpacked and printed with spaces between the elements.

Let's assume `ans` is indeed the list provided in the initial state. We'll break down the elements of the list:

1. \( k - (1 << i) \): This represents \( k \) minus \( 2^i \).
2. \( k + 1 \): This is simply \( k \) plus one.
3. \( k + 1 + (1 << i) \): This represents \( k + 1 \) plus \( 2^i \).
4. The remaining elements are powers of 2 starting from \( 2^0 \) up to \( 2^{20} \).

Since the exact values of \( k \) and \( i \) are not specified, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of the first three elements. However, we can describe them precisely based on the given formulae.

Thus, the output will be a series of numbers where the first three are described by the formulas above, and the rest are explicit powers of 2.

Output: **k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072 (where k - (1 << i) is k minus 2 raised to the power of i, k + 1 is k plus one, and k + 1 + (1 << i) is k plus one plus 2 raised to the power of i)**
