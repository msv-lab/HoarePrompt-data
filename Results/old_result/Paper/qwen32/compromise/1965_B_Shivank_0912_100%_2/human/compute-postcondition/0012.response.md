Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an integer; `k` is unchanged; `i` is \(\lfloor \log_2(k) \rfloor\); `ans` is \([k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]\).**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is calculated as a list containing three elements: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.
