The code appends the value of `1 << j` to the list `ans`. Given that `j` is 0, `1 << j` evaluates to `1 << 0`, which is 1. Therefore, the list `ans` now includes an additional element, which is 1.

The other variables (`tc`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1]`, `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is the second integer from input, `i` is the largest integer such that \(1 \ll (i + 1) \leq k\), `j` is 0, and `j` is not equal to `i`.**
