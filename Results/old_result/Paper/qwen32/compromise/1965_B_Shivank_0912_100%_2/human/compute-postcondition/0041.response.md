To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is only `j`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 19 (inclusive), meaning `j` will take values from 0 to 19.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` if `j` equals `i`; otherwise, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1]`.
- `tc` is 2.
- `n` is the first integer from input.
- `k` is the second integer from input.
- `i` is the largest integer such that \(1 \ll (i + 1) \leq k\).
- `j` is 0.

Since the loop increments `j` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1. The other variables (`ans`, `tc`, `n`, `k`, `i`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` if `j` equals `i`; otherwise, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1]`, `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is the second integer from input, `i` is the largest integer such that \(1 \ll (i + 1) \leq k\), and `j` is 1**.
