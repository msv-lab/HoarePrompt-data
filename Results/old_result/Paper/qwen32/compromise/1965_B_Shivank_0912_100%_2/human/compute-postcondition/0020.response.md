To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is just `j`. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to 19.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is an integer.
- `k` is unchanged.
- `i` is \(\lfloor \log_2(k) \rfloor\).
- `ans` is \([k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]\) if `j` equals `i`, otherwise `ans` is \([k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j]\).
- `j` is `x + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `x + 1`. For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the new value of `j` will be `(x + 1) + 1 = x + 2`.

No other variables in the loop head (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `ans`) need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop's control structure.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an integer; `k` is unchanged; `i` is \(\lfloor \log_2(k) \rfloor\); `ans` is \([k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]\) if `j` equals `i`, otherwise `ans` is \([k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j]\); `j` is \(x + 2\)**
