To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given conditions. The loop increments `i` as long as `1 << (i + 1)` (which is equivalent to \(2^{i+1}\)) is less than or equal to `k`.

From the provided output states after the first 3 iterations, we can see that:
- After 1 iteration, `k` must be at least 2.
- After 2 iterations, `k` must be at least 4.
- After 3 iterations, `k` must be at least 8.

This pattern suggests that after `i` iterations, `k` must be at least \(2^{i+1}\). The loop will terminate when \(2^{i+1} > k\).

The maximum value of `i` can be determined by finding the largest `i` such that \(2^{i+1} \leq k\). This is equivalent to finding the floor of the base-2 logarithm of `k`, which is `int(log2(k))`.

Let's denote the final value of `i` as `i_final`. Then, `i_final` is the largest integer such that \(2^{i_{final} + 1} \leq k\), or equivalently, `i_final = int(log2(k))`.

Therefore, the final state of `i` will be `int(log2(k))`.

Since the problem specifies that `t` and `n` are not affected by the loop, their values remain unchanged.

**Output State:** `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `i` is `int(log2(k))`.

In natural language, the final output state is: `t` remains the same input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` remains the same integer, `k` remains the same integer, and `i` becomes the integer part of the base-2 logarithm of `k`.
