To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ans))` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and identify the value of `ans`.

### Initial State Analysis:

- The initial state provides a list with specific elements: `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]`.
- The variable `ans` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, we need to infer if `ans` is related to this list or if it's defined elsewhere in the code snippet provided.

### Code Snippet Analysis:

- The provided code snippet only contains the `print(len(ans))` statement.
- There is no assignment or definition of `ans` within the given snippet.

### Conclusion:

Given the information provided, it appears that `ans` is not defined within the snippet or the initial state. Therefore, it's impossible to determine the length of `ans` based solely on the provided information.

However, if we assume that `ans` is intended to be the list provided in the initial state, then `ans` would have 21 elements.

### Output:

Since `ans` is not explicitly defined in the provided information, we cannot provide a precise output. But based on the assumption that `ans` is the list provided in the initial state, the output would be:

Output: **21 (assuming ans is the list provided in the initial state)**

If `ans` is not the list provided in the initial state, then the output cannot be determined from the given information.
