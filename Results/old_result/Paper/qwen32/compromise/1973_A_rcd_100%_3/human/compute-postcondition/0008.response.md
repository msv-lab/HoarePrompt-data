Given the initial state, we know the following:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing the scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- The current value of `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

We need to determine the output of the `print` statement: `print(p1 + p2)`.

From the conditions, we know:
1. `p1 + p2 + p3` is odd.
2. `p3 >= p1 + p2`.

Since `p1 + p2 + p3` is odd and `p3 >= p1 + p2`, let's analyze the implications:
- If `p1 + p2` is even, then `p3` must be odd to make the total sum odd.
- If `p1 + p2` is odd, then `p3` must be even to make the total sum odd.

However, since `p3 >= p1 + p2` and `p3` must be an integer, the value of `p1 + p2` doesn't directly affect the parity of `p3` but does affect the sum's parity.

The specific values of `p1` and `p2` are not provided, but we know their sum will be printed.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement will be the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 and p2 are integers read from the input and their sum is part of an odd total with p3)**
