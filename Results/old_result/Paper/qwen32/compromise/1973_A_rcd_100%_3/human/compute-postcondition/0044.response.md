Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 1 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it's part of the precondition).
- `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `x` is 0.
- `y` is `p3`.
- `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`.

### Variables and Their Values:
- `x` is explicitly given as 0.
- `y` is explicitly given as `p3`.
- `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, which translates to `p1 <= p2 - p3` due to `x` being 0 and `y` being `p3`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(p1 - x + p3)
```

### Calculation:
- `x` is 0, so `p1 - x` simplifies to `p1`.
- The expression `p1 - x + p3` simplifies to `p1 + p3`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the sum of `p1` and `p3`.

### Final Output:
Output: **p1 + p3 (where p1 and p3 are the integers read from the input and p1 + p3 is the sum of p1 and p3)**
