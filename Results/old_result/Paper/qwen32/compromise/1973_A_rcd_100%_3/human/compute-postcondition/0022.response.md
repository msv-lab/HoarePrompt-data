The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables. It simply terminates the most internal loop or if statement it is inside. Therefore, none of the variables `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `x`, or `y` change their values.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, then `x` remains 0 and `y` remains `p3`. Otherwise, `x` becomes 1 and `y` becomes `p3 - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
