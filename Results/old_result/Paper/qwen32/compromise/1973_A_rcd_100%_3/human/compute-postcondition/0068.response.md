Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the loop will print either `p1 - x + p3` where `p1 - x <= p2 - y` or `p3` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking.**

Given the provided precondition and the structure of the if-else block, the postcondition essentially reflects the same conditions and behaviors as described in the if part since there is no else part. Therefore, the postcondition summarizes that `t` remains greater than 0, the scores `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are still sorted in non-decreasing order, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. Additionally, it specifies the behavior of the program based on the condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` and the described loop behavior when this condition is not met.
