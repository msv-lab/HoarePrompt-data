To determine what will be printed by the `print(p1 - x + p3)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `t` is greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it's part of the initial state).
   - `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `p3` is non-negative.
   - `x` is 0.
   - `y` is `p3`.
   - `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`.

2. **Substituting Values in the Print Statement:**
   - Since `x` is 0, the expression `p1 - x` simplifies to `p1`.
   - The expression `p1 - x + p3` thus simplifies to `p1 + p3`.

3. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `p1 + p3`.

Given the information, we can't determine the exact numerical values of `p1` and `p3` because they are read from the input. However, we know the expression that will be evaluated and printed.

Output: **p1 + p3 (where p1 and p3 are integers read from the input)**
