To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute its first iteration, we need to focus on the variables `x` and `y` as they are the only ones mentioned in the loop condition `y >= x`.

Given:
- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input, and their sum is odd.
- `x` is 0.
- `y` is `p3`.

The loop condition is `y >= x`. Since `x` is 0 and `y` is `p3`, the loop will execute if `p3 >= 0`.

Let's analyze the given conditions:
- `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are sorted in non-decreasing order, so `p3` is the largest of the three scores.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. This condition does not directly affect the loop condition but ensures that the scores have a specific parity.

Since `p3` is the largest score and the scores are sorted in non-decreasing order, `p3` must be at least 0 for the loop to execute. Given that `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers and their sum is odd, `p3` being 0 or greater is a valid state.

Therefore, no further adjustment is needed for `y` (which is `p3`) as long as it is 0 or greater, which it already is by the problem's constraints.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. `x` is 0; `y` is `p3`.**
