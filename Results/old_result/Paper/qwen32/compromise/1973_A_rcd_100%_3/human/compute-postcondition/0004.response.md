The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1`. The initial state provides some context about the variables `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is simply outputting the integer `-1`.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   - The `print` statement is `print(-1)`.

Since the `print` statement directly outputs `-1` and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state, the output will be `-1`.

Output: **-1**
