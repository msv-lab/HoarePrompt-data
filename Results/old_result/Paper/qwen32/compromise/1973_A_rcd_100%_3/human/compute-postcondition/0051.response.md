To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `t` must be greater than 1, but `t` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
2. `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input.
4. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
5. `p3` must be at least 1.

### Print Statement:
```
print(p1 - x + p3)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement depends on the values of `p1`, `p3`, and `x`.
- `p1` and `p3` are directly given as input values.
- `x` is not defined in the initial state or the print statement. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `x` from the given information.

### Conclusion:
Since `x` is not defined, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of the expression `p1 - x + p3`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the variables provided.

Output: **p1 - x + p3 (where p1 is the first input value, p3 is the third input value, and x is an undefined variable)**
