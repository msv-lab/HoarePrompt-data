Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. `x` is 1; `y` is `p3`. Additionally, `p1 - x` is greater than `p2 - y`.**

In simple terms, the value of `x` has been incremented by 1, changing it from 0 to 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
