Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `p3` is non-negative, `x` is either 1 or 2. If `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is either 2 or 3, and `y` is at least `x - 1`.**
