The code snippet reads three integers from the input, which are then assigned to the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, and `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order. However, the code snippet does not affect `t` or the initial `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`. Instead, it introduces new variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` with the values from the input.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input.**
