To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior based on the given code and the provided states.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - The loop runs `t` times.
   - For each iteration, three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are read from the input.
   - These integers represent scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order: `0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30`.

2. **Loop Body:**
   - If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the loop prints `-1` and continues to the next iteration.
   - If the sum is even:
     - If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, it prints `p1 + p2`.
     - Otherwise, it enters a while loop where it tries to find values of `x` and `y` such that `p1 - x <= p2 - y` and prints `p1 - x + p3`. If no such values are found, it prints `p3`.

### Output State after All Iterations:
- The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will output either `-1` (if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd) or a calculated value based on the conditions provided.
- The output state after all iterations is a sequence of `t` outputs, each corresponding to the result of one iteration of the loop.

### Final Output State:
- The output state is a list of `t` values, each being either `-1` or a calculated value based on the conditions in the loop.

Since the exact values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` for each iteration are not provided, we can only describe the output state in terms of the possible values that could be printed for each iteration.

### Conclusion:
The output state after all executions of the loop will be a sequence of `t` outputs, each being either `-1` or a calculated value based on the conditions in the loop.

Output State: **A sequence of `t` outputs, each being either `-1` or a calculated value based on the conditions in the loop.**
