Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `p3` is non-negative, `x` is 0, `y` is `p3`, `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms: The values of `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
