### Reasoning:
Let's systematically evaluate the program using the annotated version and the provided test cases to ensure its correctness.

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - The number of test cases \( t \) is between 1 and 500.
   - Each test case consists of three integers \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \) where \( 0 \leq p_1, p_2, p_3 \leq 30 \).

2. **Logic for Maximum Draws:**
   - **Sum of Scores Check:** The program first checks if the total sum of scores \((p_1 + p_2 + p_3)\) is even. If not, it prints `-1` because an odd total score is impossible since each game results in an even total score (either 0+2, 2+0, or 1+1).
   - **Maximum Draws Calculation:**
     - If \( p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2 \), the maximum number of draws is \( p_1 + p_2 \). This is because the third player's score could be entirely from wins against the other two players, and the remaining points could be from draws among the three.
     - Otherwise, the program uses a loop to find the maximum number of draws. It iterates over possible values of \( x \) (points from wins by the first player) and \( y \) (points from wins by the second player) such that \( p1 - x \leq p2 - y \). The maximum number of draws is then calculated as \( p1 - x + p3 \).

### Verification Against Test Cases

Let's verify the program against the provided example input:

1. **Test Case: 0 0 0**
   - Total score is 0, which is even.
   - Since \( p_3 < p_1 + p_2 \), it enters the loop but finds that \( p1 - x \leq p2 - y \) is satisfied with \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \).
   - The maximum number of draws is \( p1 - 0 + p3 = 0 \).
   - **Output:** 0 (Correct)

2. **Test Case: 0 1 1**
   - Total score is 2, which is even.
   - Since \( p_3 < p_1 + p_2 \), it enters the loop and finds that \( p1 - x \leq p2 - y \) is satisfied with \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 1 \).
   - The maximum number of draws is \( p1 - 0 + p3 = 1 \).
   - **Output:** 1 (Correct)

3. **Test Case: 1 1 1**
   - Total score is 3, which is odd.
   - The program correctly outputs `-1`.
   - **Output:** -1 (Correct)

4. **Test Case: 1 1 2**
   - Total score is 4, which is even.
   - Since \( p_3 < p_1 + p_2 \), it enters the loop and finds that \( p1 - x \leq p2 - y \) is satisfied with \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \).
   - The maximum number of draws is \( p1 - 0 + p3 = 2 \).
   - **Output:** 2 (Correct)

5. **Test Case: 3 3 3**
   - Total score is 9, which is odd.
   - The program correctly outputs `-1`.
   - **Output:** -1 (Correct)

6. **Test Case: 3 4 5**
   - Total score is 12, which is even.
   - Since \( p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2 \), the maximum number of draws is \( p_1 + p_2 = 7 \).
   - **Output:** 7 (Incorrect, should be 6)
     - The correct logic should be recalculated. The maximum number of draws should be recalculated to ensure the correct maximum number of draws is found.
     - The correct calculation should be:
       - If \( p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2 \), the maximum number of draws is \( p_1 + p_2 - \text{min}(p_3 - p_2, p_3 - p_1) \).
       - For this case, \( p_3 - p_2 = 1 \) and \( p_3 - p_1 = 2 \), so the minimum is 1. Thus, the maximum number of draws is \( 3 + 4 - 1 = 6 \).

7. **Test Case: 1 1 10**
   - Total score is 12, which is even.
   - Since \( p_3 < p_1 + p_2 \), it enters the loop and finds that \( p1 - x \leq p2 - y \) is satisfied with \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \).
   - The maximum number of draws is \( p1 - 0 + p3 = 2 \).
   - **Output:** 2 (Correct)

### Conclusion

Upon re-evaluation, the program is incorrect for the test case `3 4 5`. The maximum number of draws should be 6, not 7. The logic for calculating the maximum number of draws when \( p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2 \) needs to be adjusted.

**Correctness: False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all edge cases, specifically the test case `3 4 5` where the maximum number of draws should be 6, not 7. The logic for calculating the maximum number of draws when \( p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2 \) needs to be adjusted to correctly account for the minimum difference between \( p_3 \) and the other scores.

Final: **False**
