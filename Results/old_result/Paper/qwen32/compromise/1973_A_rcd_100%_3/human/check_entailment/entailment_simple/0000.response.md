### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred in a series of chess games among three players given their final scores. The program follows these steps for each test case:

1. **Input Parsing**: It reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players, with the condition that `p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3`.

2. **Total Points Check**: It first checks if the total points `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is odd, the program prints `-1` because the total points from the games must be even (each game awards 2 points in total, either 2-0 or 1-1).

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - If `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, it prints `p1 + p2`. This is because in this scenario, the highest score could be achieved by the player with `p3` winning all games against the other two players, and the other two players splitting their games among each other, which could include `p1 + p2` draws.
   - Otherwise, it uses a loop to find the maximum number of draws `x` and `y` such that `p1 - x` (remaining points of player 1 after accounting for draws) is less than or equal to `p2 - y` (remaining points of player 2 after accounting for draws). The loop iterates over possible values of `x` and `y` to find the maximum number of draws `p1 - x + p3` that satisfies the condition.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles cases where no games were played (`p1 = p2 = p3 = 0`), cases with one draw (`p1 = 0, p2 = 1, p3 = 1`), and cases where no valid game configuration exists (`p1 = 1, p2 = 1, p3 = 1`).

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or identify invalid score configurations. It handles the given constraints and examples accurately. Therefore, the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description and examples is:

Correctness: **True**
