### Reasoning:

The given problem requires us to determine if it's possible to redistribute the water in such a way that all containers end up with the same amount of water. The key observation here is that the sum of water in all containers is divisible by `n` (the number of containers), which means it's theoretically possible to distribute the water evenly.

The program uses a greedy approach to solve this problem. Here's how it works:

1. **Calculate the Mean**: The program first calculates the mean amount of water each container should have, which is `total / n`.

2. **Check Balance**: It then iterates through the list of containers, maintaining a running balance (`curr`). This balance keeps track of the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the mean up to that point.
   
3. **Condition Check**: If at any point the balance (`curr`) becomes negative, it means there's not enough water in the previous containers to balance out the deficit in the current container, making it impossible to redistribute the water evenly. In such a case, the program returns 'NO'.

4. **Return 'YES'**: If the loop completes without the balance ever going negative, it means the water can be redistributed evenly, and the program returns 'YES'.

### Correctness:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the water can be evenly distributed. The condition that ensures correctness is the check for the running balance (`curr`). If `curr` becomes negative at any point, it indicates an imbalance that cannot be corrected by subsequent operations (since water can only be transferred from earlier containers to later ones).

Therefore, the program correctly determines whether the water can be evenly distributed based on the given constraints and the problem description.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
