Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`. For each test case, it determines if `n` is even and less than or equal to 100. If both conditions are met, it outputs 'YES' followed by a string of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. If `n` is odd or greater than 100, it outputs 'NO'.**
