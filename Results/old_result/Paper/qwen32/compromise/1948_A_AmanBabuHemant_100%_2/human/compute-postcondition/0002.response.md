Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and `n` holds the value of the last integer input within the loop. The program will have printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on whether the input `n` is even and less than or equal to 100, and if 'YES', it will have printed a string of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.**
