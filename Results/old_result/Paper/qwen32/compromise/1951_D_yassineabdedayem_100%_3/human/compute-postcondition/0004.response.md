Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` (coins Alice has) and `k` (jewels Bob wants). For each test case, it determines if Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels with her `n` coins under specific conditions and prints 'YES' followed by two integers if possible, otherwise prints 'NO'.**
