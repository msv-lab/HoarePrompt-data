### Reasoning:

The given program is not correct based on the problem description. The logic implemented in the program is overly simplistic and does not cover all possible scenarios for setting up the stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Let's break down the logic and the scenarios:

1. **Case 1: `n == k`**
   - The program correctly identifies this case and outputs "YES" with a single stall priced at 1 coin per jewel. This is correct because Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels if `n == k` and the price per jewel is 1.

2. **Case 2: `n + 2 > k * 2`**
   - The program checks this condition and provides a solution with two stalls. The first stall is priced at `n - k + 1` and the second stall at 1 coin per jewel.
   - This logic is flawed. For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 3`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` (12 > 6) is true, but the solution provided (`p1 = 8`, `p2 = 1`) is incorrect. Alice will buy 1 jewel from the first stall, leaving her with `2` coins, and then she can buy 2 more jewels from the second stall, resulting in a total of 3 jewels bought. However, the condition does not guarantee this for all values of `n` and `k`. It is too simplistic and does not cover all cases where a valid setup of stalls is possible.

3. **Case 3: All other cases**
   - The program outputs "NO" for all other cases, which is incorrect. There are many scenarios where it is possible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, even if `n + 2 <= k * 2`.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, Bob should be able to set up stalls such that the sum of the maximum number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall equals `k`. This can be achieved by using a greedy approach to set up the stalls with prices that allow Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.

For example, one possible approach is to use binary representation to determine the number of stalls and their prices. If `k` can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2, then Bob can set up stalls with prices corresponding to these powers of 2. This ensures that Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by buying one jewel from each stall corresponding to the powers of 2 in the binary representation of `k`.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the provided program is not correct for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
