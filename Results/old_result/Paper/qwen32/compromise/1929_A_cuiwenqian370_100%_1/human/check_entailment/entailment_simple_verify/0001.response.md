### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the core logic of the problem and the solution. The key to maximizing the beauty of the array is indeed sorting the array. When the array is sorted, the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements is maximized because the largest possible differences occur between the smallest and largest elements in the sorted array.

Let's break down the annotated version to ensure everything aligns with this understanding:

1. **Function `func_1(array)`**:
   - The array is sorted, which is correct for maximizing the beauty.
   - The beauty is calculated by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. The annotation correctly states that the beauty is the difference between the last and first elements of the sorted array, but this is an oversimplification. The beauty is actually the sum of all differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, not just the difference between the first and last elements.
   - The annotation correctly states the final state of the array and the beauty value.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - The function reads input, processes multiple test cases, and correctly uses `func_1` to compute the beauty for each test case.
   - The state annotations correctly describe the state of the program throughout the execution of `func_2`.

### Validation:
- The logic in `func_1` is correct: sorting the array and summing the differences between consecutive elements maximizes the beauty.
- The logic in `func_2` is correct: it handles multiple test cases and correctly processes each one.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic needed to find the maximum beauty of the array for each test case.

Final: **True**
