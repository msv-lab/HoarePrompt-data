The code reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, which are the individual components of the input separated by whitespace. This list of strings is assigned to the variable `data`.

Given the initial state where `array` is a list of integers and `input` is `sys.stdin.read`, after executing the code, `data` will be a list of strings corresponding to the integers in the input.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers with length n where 2 <= n <= 100 and each integer a_i in array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `data` is a list of strings, each string representing an integer from the input.**
