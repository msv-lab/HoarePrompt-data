Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to determine if Rudolf can make all elements of the array equal to zero using the specified operation. However, there are several issues with the implementation of `func_2` that make the program incorrect.

1. **Incorrect Decrement Logic**: The lines inside the `while` loop in `func_2` are incorrect. The operation described in the problem statement should decrement `a_{i-1}` by 1, `a_i` by 2, and `a_{i+1}` by 1. However, the current code incorrectly multiplies these decrements by `list[i - 1]`:
   ```python
   list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
   list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
   list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
   ```
   This should be:
   ```python
   list[i + 1] -= 1
   list[i] -= 2
   list[i - 1] -= 1
   ```

2. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The condition `while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0` is not sufficient to ensure that the operation can be applied. The correct condition should only check if `list[i] >= 2` and `list[i - 1] >= 1` and `list[i + 1] >= 1` because the operation requires `a_i` to be at least 2, and `a_{i-1}` and `a_{i+1}` to be at least 1.

3. **Early Termination**: The code prints 'no' and returns immediately if `list[i - 1]` is not zero after processing the `i`-th element. However, this is incorrect because the operation might be able to reduce the values of subsequent elements to zero. The correct approach is to process the entire array and then check if all elements are zero using `func_1`.

4. **Case Insensitivity in Output**: The problem statement specifies that the output can be in any case (uppercase or lowercase). The current implementation prints 'no' and 'YES'/'NO', which is inconsistent. It should consistently print in the same case or allow for both cases.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine if Rudolf can make all elements of the array equal to zero.

Correctness: **False**
