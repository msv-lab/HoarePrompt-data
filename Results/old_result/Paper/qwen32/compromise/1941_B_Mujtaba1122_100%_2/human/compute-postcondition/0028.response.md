The code `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` modifies the list by subtracting the value of `list[i - 1]` from `list[i + 1]`. Here, `i` is 1, so `list[i - 1]` is `list[0]` which is 1, and `list[i + 1]` is `list[2]` which is also 1. After the operation, `list[2]` becomes `1 - 1 = 0`.

Output State: **The list is [1, 2, 0, 0, 0, ...] and `i` is 1.**
