Postcondition: **The list consists of zeros, `i` is 1, and the element at index 0 of the list is not 0.** 

(Note: The precondition states that the list initially consists of zeros, but the if condition implies that the element at index 0 is not zero, which seems contradictory. However, based on the given if condition, we must include it in the postcondition as a requirement for entering the if statement.)
