Given the initial state, the list is `[1, 2, 0, 0, 0, ...]` and `i` is `1`.

The code snippet:
```
list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
```

This means the element at index `i` in the list will be updated by subtracting twice the element at index `i - 1`.

Let's perform the calculation:
- `list[i]` is `list[1]`, which is `2`.
- `list[i - 1]` is `list[0]`, which is `1`.
- `2 * list[0]` is `2 * 1`, which is `2`.
- `list[1] -= 2` means `list[1]` is updated to `2 - 2`, which is `0`.

After this operation, the list becomes `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]` and `i` remains `1`.

Output State: **The list is [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...] and `i` is 1.**
