The code snippet `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` modifies the element at index `i - 1` in the list. Given that `i` is 1, the element at index `0` (which is `list[i - 1]`) will be updated. The operation `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` is equivalent to setting `list[i - 1]` to `0` because any number minus itself is `0`.

Output State: **The list is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...] and `i` is 1.**
