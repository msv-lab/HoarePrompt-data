The code snippet `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` modifies the value at the index `i - 1` of the list. Given that `i` is 1, `list[i - 1]` refers to `list[0]`, which initially has a value of 1. The operation `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` effectively sets `list[0]` to 0 because `1 * 1` is 1, and `1 - 1` is 0.

The rest of the list and the value of `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **The list is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...] and `i` is 1.**
