The code `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` modifies the element at index `i + 1` of the list by subtracting the value of the element at index `i - 1`. The other elements of the list and the value of `n` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `list` is `[1, 2, 1, ...]` (where the rest of the list can be any non-negative integers)
- `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3` and `n` equals the length of the list

After executing the code, the element at index `i + 1` will be updated. Specifically, if we denote the original value at `list[i + 1]` as `list[i + 1]_original`, then the new value at `list[i + 1]` will be `list[i + 1]_original - list[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`list` is `[1, 2, 1 - list[0], ...]` (where the rest of the list can be any non-negative integers except the element at index `i + 1` which is updated as described), `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3` and `n` equals the length of the list.**

In simpler terms, the element at index `i + 1` in the list is reduced by the value of the element at index `i - 1`. The rest of the list remains unchanged, and `n` retains its original value.
