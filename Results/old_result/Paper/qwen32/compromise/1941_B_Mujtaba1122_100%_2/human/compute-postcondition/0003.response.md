The code snippet `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` modifies the element at index `i` of the list by subtracting twice the value of the element at index `i - 1` from it.

Given the initial state:
- `list` is `[1, 2, 1 - list[0], ...]` (where the rest of the list can be any non-negative integers except the element at index `i + 1` which is updated as described).
- `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3` and `n` equals the length of the list.

Let's calculate the output state:

1. The element at index `i` is updated as `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`.
2. Since `list[0]` is `1`, the third element `list[2]` is initially `1 - list[0]`, which simplifies to `1 - 1 = 0`.
3. If `i` is `2`, then `list[2]` is updated to `list[2] - 2 * list[1]`, which is `0 - 2 * 2 = -4`.

Other parts of the list remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list` is `[1, 2, -4, ...]` (where the rest of the list can be any non-negative integers except the element at index `i + 1` which is updated as described), `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3` and `n` equals the length of the list.**

Note: The specific values of elements other than `list[i]` remain as per the initial state, and `n` remains unchanged.
