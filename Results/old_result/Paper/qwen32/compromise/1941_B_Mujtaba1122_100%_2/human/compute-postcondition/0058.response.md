The given initial state describes a list that is initialized with all elements as 0, and a function `func_1` that takes the list and an integer `n` as arguments and returns `False`. However, the print statement provided does not depend on the function `func_1` or the list directly; it simply prints the string 'NO'.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The list is initialized with all elements as 0, but this detail is not relevant to what is printed in the provided `print` statement.
2. The function `func_1` is mentioned to return `False` when called with the list and `n` as arguments, but this function is not used in the provided `print` statement.
3. The `print` statement directly outputs the string 'NO'.

Given these points, the output of the print statement is simply 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
