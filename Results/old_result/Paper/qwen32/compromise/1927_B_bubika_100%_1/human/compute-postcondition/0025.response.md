The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the elements of the list `s`. For the loop to execute, the list `s` must have at least one element. The other variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `r` are not directly involved in the loop's execution and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted so that `s` contains at least one element.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `b` is a list of 26 integers where each integer is 0; `s` is a list of integers with at least one element; `r` is an empty string**
