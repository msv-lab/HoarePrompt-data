Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. The logic in the program is flawed, especially in how it calculates the number of fireworks that can be seen at the same time, especially when the visibility period `m` is large compared to the launch intervals `a` and `b`.

Here is a more detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Overlaps**: The program does not correctly account for the overlaps in the visibility periods of fireworks from both installations. It simply adds the number of fireworks from each installation and adds 2, which is incorrect.

2. **Incorrect Condition**: The condition `if m < a or m < b` is not sufficient to determine the correct number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. It simply assumes that if the visibility period is less than the launch interval, the maximum number is 2, which is not always true.

3. **Lack of Consideration for Common Multiples**: The program does not consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the correct number of fireworks that can be seen at the same time.

A correct approach would involve calculating the number of fireworks visible from each installation separately and then considering the overlaps using the LCM of `a` and `b`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        
        # Number of fireworks from installation 1
        count_a = m // a + 1
        # Number of fireworks from installation 2
        count_b = m // b + 1
        # Number of fireworks from both installations (overlap)
        count_ab = m // lcm_ab + 1
        
        # Total number of fireworks seen at the same time
        total = count_a + count_b - count_ab
        print(total)

func()
```

This corrected program calculates the number of fireworks from each installation and subtracts the overlaps correctly using the LCM.
