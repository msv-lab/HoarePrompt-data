Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to count the minimum number of operations needed to gather all chips into a single contiguous block by moving each chip to the leftmost available free cell. However, the current implementation does not correctly calculate this.

The program's current logic is to remove leading and trailing zeros and then count the remaining zeros. This does not actually solve the problem because it does not consider the optimal way to move chips to form a contiguous block. The number of operations needed is not simply the number of zeros between the first and last chip.

For example, in the first test case of the problem statement:
```
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```
The output should be `1` because you can move the chip from position 7 to position 5. However, the program will count `3` zeros between the first and last chip (positions 2 to 8), which is incorrect.

A correct approach would involve calculating the cost of moving each chip to the leftmost possible position to form a contiguous block. This involves more complex logic than simply counting zeros.

Therefore, the given program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
