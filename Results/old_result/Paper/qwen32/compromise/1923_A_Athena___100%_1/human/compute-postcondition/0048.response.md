Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 999, `a` is a list with all trailing zeros removed, `n` is the integer input by the user, `res` is 0.**

In simple terms, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `a` will no longer contain any trailing zeros. The integer `t`, the integer `n`, and the integer `res` will remain unchanged from their initial states.
