The code snippet `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that `a` contains at least one element which is 0, after the `pop` operation, the list `a` will have one less element than it originally had. The values of `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 999, `a` is a list with one less element than it originally had, `n` is the integer input by the user, `res` is 0.**
