The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Given that `res` is initially either 0 or 1 (depending on whether the current element `a[i]` is 0 or not), after the operation, `res` will be either 1 or 2.

The other variables `t`, `a`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 999, `a` is a list with at least one element, `n` is the integer input by the user, `res` is either 1 or 2, `i` is incremented by 1**.
