The code removes the last element from the list `a` using `a.pop()`. Given that the last element of `a` is `0`, after executing this line, the list `a` will no longer contain that `0` at the end. The values of `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 999, `a` is a non-empty list (without the last element which was 0), `n` is the integer input by the user, and `res` is 0.**
