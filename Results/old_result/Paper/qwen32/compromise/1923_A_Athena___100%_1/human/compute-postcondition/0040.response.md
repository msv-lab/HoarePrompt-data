The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Given that `a` starts with `0`, after the execution of this line, the first element `0` will be removed from the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 999, `a` is the original list with the first element `0` removed, `n` is the integer input by the user, `res` is 0.**
