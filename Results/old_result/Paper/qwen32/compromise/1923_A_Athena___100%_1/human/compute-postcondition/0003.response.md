The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each of these components to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `a`.

Given the initial state, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `n` is an input integer. The value of `n` indicates the number of integers to be read from the input for the list `a`.

After the execution of the code, `a` will be a list of integers derived from the input. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from the input.**
