Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description in all cases. Let's analyze the code and find a potential issue.

The main logic of the program is inside the loop that iterates through the list elements. It attempts to split an element if it is greater than 10 and the list is not sorted. However, the logic is flawed in several ways:

1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**: The program splits the number into two digits by integer division and modulo operations, but this approach does not correctly split numbers with more than two digits. For example, the number 123 should be split into [1, 2, 3], but the code will only split it into [12, 3].

2. **Inefficient and Incomplete Check**: The program checks if the list is sorted using the `func_1` function. If the list is not sorted, it attempts to split the previous element. However, this approach is not sufficient to guarantee that the list will become sorted. The program does not consider all possible splits and does not handle cases where multiple splits are needed.

3. **Incorrect Loop Logic**: The loop iterates from the second element to the end of the list. If an element needs to be split, it modifies the list, but the loop index does not account for the new elements that are inserted. This can lead to skipping elements or incorrect comparisons.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the list is already sorted or where the list cannot be sorted by any number of splits.

Let's consider a specific example to demonstrate the failure:

**Example:**

Input:
```
1
4
123 4 5 6
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Explanation:
- The number 123 can be split into [1, 2, 3].
- The resulting list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] is sorted.

However, the provided program will not handle this case correctly because it cannot split 123 into [1, 2, 3] using the current logic.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
