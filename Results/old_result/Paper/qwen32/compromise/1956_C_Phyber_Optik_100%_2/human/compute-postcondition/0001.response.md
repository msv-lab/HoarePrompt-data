The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since the loop will execute based on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be initialized before the loop starts.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
