To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's first understand the loop structure and the initial state provided.

### Loop Structure:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
    print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Initial State:
- The sum is calculated as 1 plus the sum of \((2i^2 - i)\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

### Observations:
- The loop runs from \(j = 1\) to \(j = n\).
- For each iteration, the loop prints two lines:
  1. The first line prints `1`, followed by \(n - j + 1\), and then all integers from 1 to \(n\).
  2. The second line prints `2`, followed by \(n - j + 1\), and then all integers from 1 to \(n\).

### Output States After Iterations:
- **After 1 iteration:** `n` must be at least 1, and `j` is 1.
- **After 2 iterations:** `n` must be at least 2, and `j` is 2.
- **After 3 iterations:** `n` must be at least 3, and `j` is 3.

### Final State:
- The loop will run `n` times, with `j` taking values from 1 to \(n\).
- After all iterations, `j` will be \(n + 1\).

### Sum Calculation:
- The sum is calculated as 1 plus the sum of \((2i^2 - i)\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). This part of the state does not change with each iteration of the loop.

### Final Output State:
- The sum remains the same as initially calculated.
- The loop variable `j` will be \(n + 1\) after the loop finishes.

### Conclusion:
Output State: **the sum is calculated as 1 plus the sum of (2i^2 - i) for i from 2 to n, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is n + 1.**

In natural language, the final output state is that the sum remains the same as initially calculated, and the loop variable `j` will be \(n + 1\) after the loop has completed all its iterations.
