The code snippet modifies the variable `sum` by adding the result of the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to it. Let's break down the expression:

- `i * i` computes the square of `i`.
- `(i - 1) * (i - 1)` computes the square of `i - 1`.
- Subtracting the second result from the first gives the difference of squares between `i` and `i - 1`, which simplifies to `2*i - 1`.
- Multiplying this result by `i` gives `i * (2*i - 1)`.

Therefore, the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` simplifies to `i * (2*i - 1)`. This value is added to `sum`.

The value of `n` is not affected by this code snippet, and it is still required to be greater than 1.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `sum` is increased by `i * (2*i - 1)`**.
