The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, the loop variable `i` starts at 2 and increments by 1 in each iteration. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` must have been some value, and `n` must be greater than 1. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration. The value of `n` remains unchanged as long as it is greater than 1.

Given that `sum` is increased by `i * (2*i - 1)` in each iteration, we do not need to adjust `sum` because it is not part of the loop head and its value is derived from the loop variable `i`.

Let's assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`. Since `n` must be greater than 1 and we do not have a specific value for `n` other than it being greater than 1, we keep that condition as is.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more specific, if `i` was 2 at the start of the loop and was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`. Since we do not have a specific value for `k` other than it being the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**.

If we assume `i` was 2 at the start and was 3 at the end of the first iteration, then at the start of the second iteration, `i` should be 4. So, let's assume `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration for concreteness:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 4**. 

However, to be completely general without assuming specific values:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**.
