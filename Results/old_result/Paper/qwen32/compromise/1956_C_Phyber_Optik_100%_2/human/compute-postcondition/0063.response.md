To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables. The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = n`, and in each iteration, it prints two lines of output but does not modify `n`, `t`, or `sum` directly. Here's the loop for reference:

```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
    print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `j` is an input integer + 1, but this value of `j` is not relevant for the loop as `j` is reassigned in the loop header.
- `t` is `t - 1`, but `t` is not affected by the loop.
- `sum` is \(\frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6}\), and it is also not affected by the loop.

After the loop completes, the value of `j` will be `n + 1` because the loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`, and after the last iteration, `j` is incremented to `n + 1`.

The values of `n`, `t`, and `sum` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop is:
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `j` is `n + 1`, `t` is `t - 1`, `sum` is \(\frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6}\)**.

In natural language, after the loop finishes executing all iterations, `j` will be `n + 1`, while `n`, `t`, and `sum` will retain their initial values.
