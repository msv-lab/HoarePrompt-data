The code snippet modifies the value of `sum` by adding the result of the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to it. Given that `i` is not defined in the initial state, we will assume `i` is a known integer variable for the purpose of this calculation.

The expression simplifies as follows:
- `i * i` is the square of `i`.
- `(i - 1) * (i - 1)` is the square of `i - 1`.
- The difference between these two squares is `(i^2 - (i - 1)^2)`, which simplifies to `(i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1))` and further simplifies to `2i - 1`.
- Multiplying this result by `i` gives `(2i - 1) * i`, which is `2i^2 - i`.

Thus, the new value of `sum` is `sum + (2i^2 - i)`.

The values of `n`, `j`, and `t` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `j` is an input integer + 1, `t` is t - 1, `sum` is `1 + (2i^2 - i)`**.
