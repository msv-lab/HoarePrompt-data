To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop and the given initial state.

The initial state is:
- `n` is the integer input provided.
- `j` is `n + 1`.
- `t` is decremented by 1 (but `t` is not part of the loop body, so it remains unchanged).
- `sum` is 1.

The loop runs from `i = 2` to `i = n` (inclusive). The loop body modifies only the `sum` variable, incrementing it by `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` in each iteration.

Let's simplify the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`:
- `i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)` simplifies to `i * i - (i^2 - 2*i + 1)` which further simplifies to `2*i - 1`.
- Therefore, the increment in `sum` in each iteration is `(2*i - 1) * i`.

The loop effectively calculates the sum of the series: `sum = 1 + Î£(i * (2*i - 1)) for i from 2 to n`.

The sum of the series can be simplified to `n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/6` (which is the sum of cubes formula) minus the first term (since the loop starts from 2, not 1).

The final value of `sum` after all iterations can be calculated as:
\[ \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i * (2*i - 1)) = 1 + \left(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1\right) = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \]

The variables `n` and `j` remain unchanged throughout the loop, and `t` is not affected by the loop.

Thus, the final output state is:
- `n` remains the same.
- `j` remains `n + 1`.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `sum` becomes \(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\).

Output State: **`n` remains the same, `j` remains `n + 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `sum` is \(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\).**

In natural language: After all iterations, the value of `n` remains the same, `j` remains `n + 1`, `t` remains unchanged, and `sum` is the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers, which is \(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\).
