The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n`.

To execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` should remain the same, provided `j` is still within the range (i.e., `j` should be less than or equal to `n`).

Since the last iteration had `j` equal to `n`, the loop cannot execute again because `j` would exceed `n` if incremented. However, if we consider the state just before the last iteration, `j` would be `n-1`, and we need to adjust it to `n` for the last iteration to happen.

Given the task is to adjust for the start of the next iteration, and assuming we are at the start of the last iteration (where `j` is `n-1`), we increment `j` to `n`.

State: **`sum` is calculated as 1 plus the sum of (2i^2 - i) for i from 2 to n, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is n**
