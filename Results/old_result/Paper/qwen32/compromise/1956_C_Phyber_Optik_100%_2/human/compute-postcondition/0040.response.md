Let's break down the `print` statement and determine the values of the variables and expressions involved.

Given:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` is 2.
- `t` remains unchanged (though `t` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this purpose).
- `sum` is \(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\) (though `sum` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this purpose).

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's analyze each part of the print statement:
1. The first argument is the integer `1`.
2. The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given that `j` is 2, this simplifies to `n - 2 + 1`, which further simplifies to `n - 1`.
3. The third part is `*range(1, n + 1)`. The `*` operator unpacks the range into individual elements. The `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Putting it all together:
- The first value printed is `1`.
- The second value printed is `n - 1`.
- The subsequent values printed are the numbers from `1` to `n`.

Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the output will always start with `1`, followed by `n - 1`, and then the numbers from `1` to `n`.

Output: **1, n - 1, 1, 2, ..., n (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 1)**
