Let's break down the given task step-by-step:

### Initial State:
1. `sum` is calculated as \(1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)\) where \(n \geq 1\).
2. `n` is a variable that must be greater than or equal to 1.
3. `j` is set to the value of `n`.

### Code to Execute:
```python
print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **First Argument (`2`)**:
   - The first argument is a literal integer `2`, so it will print `2`.

2. **Second Argument (`n - j + 1`)**:
   - According to the initial state, `j` is set to the value of `n`.
   - Therefore, `n - j + 1` simplifies to `n - n + 1`, which equals `1`.
   - So, the second argument will print `1`.

3. **Third Argument (`*range(1, n + 1)`)**:
   - The `*` operator is used to unpack the result of `range(1, n + 1)`.
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of integers from `1` to `n` inclusive.
   - Therefore, `*range(1, n + 1)` will print all integers from `1` to `n`.

### Final Output:
Combining all the above points, the print statement will output `2`, followed by `1`, and then all integers from `1` to `n`.

### Formatting the Output:
Given the format requirement, we need to describe the output based on the value of `n`. Since `n` is not explicitly given, we will represent the output in a way that reflects its dependency on `n`.

Output: **2, 1, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 1)**
