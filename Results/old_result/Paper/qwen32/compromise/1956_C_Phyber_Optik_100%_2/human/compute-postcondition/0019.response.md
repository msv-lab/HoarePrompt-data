Let's break down the given code snippet and initial state to determine the output.

### Given:
- `sum` is calculated as 1 plus the sum of (2i^2 - i) for i from 2 to n. However, the value of `sum` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore this definition for the purpose of determining the output.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` is defined as `n + 1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **First Argument: `1`**
   - This is a constant value and will be printed as `1`.

2. **Second Argument: `n - j + 1`**
   - Given that `j = n + 1`, we can substitute `j` in the expression:
     \[
     n - j + 1 = n - (n + 1) + 1 = n - n - 1 + 1 = 0
     \]
   - Therefore, `n - j + 1` evaluates to `0`.

3. **Third Argument: `*range(1, n + 1)`**
   - The `*range(1, n + 1)` will unpack the range of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
   - For example, if `n = 5`, `range(1, 6)` will produce the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
   - If `n = 1`, `range(1, 2)` will produce the number 1.

### Combining the Outputs:
- The first argument is `1`.
- The second argument is `0`.
- The third argument is the unpacked range of numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Final Output:
- If `n = 1`, the output will be: `1, 0, 1`.
- If `n = 2`, the output will be: `1, 0, 1, 2`.
- If `n = 3`, the output will be: `1, 0, 1, 2, 3`.
- And so on...

Since `n` is a variable, the exact numbers in the output will depend on the value of `n`. However, the pattern will always be `1, 0, 1, 2, ..., n`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **1, 0, 1, 2, ..., n (where n is a given integer greater than or equal to 1)**
