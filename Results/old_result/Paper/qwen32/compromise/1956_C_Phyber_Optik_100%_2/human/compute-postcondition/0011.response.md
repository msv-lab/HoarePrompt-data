To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to understand the values of the variables `sum` and `n + n` based on the initial state provided.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `sum`:**
   - The `sum` is calculated as 1 plus the sum of the expression \(2i^2 - i\) for \(i\) ranging from 2 to \(n\).
   - Mathematically, this can be written as:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)
     \]
   - This expression can be further simplified or evaluated based on the value of \(n\). However, since \(n\) is not explicitly given, we will describe the `sum` in terms of \(n\).

2. **Expression `n + n`:**
   - This expression simplifies to \(2n\).

### Output Description:
- The `print` statement will output the value of `sum` and `2n`.
- Since the exact value of \(n\) is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `sum`. However, we can describe `sum` in terms of \(n\).

### Final Output:
Output: **1 + sum(2i^2 - i for i in range(2, n+1)), 2n (where n is the given integer)**

This describes the output in terms of the given integer \(n\), providing the most precise description possible based on the initial state.
