The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `j` is `an input integer + 1`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `sum` is \(\frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6}\)

For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `an input integer + 2`. The value of `n` remains the same as it is the upper limit of the range.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is an input integer + 2, `t` is t - 1, `sum` is \(\frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6}\)**
