To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop iterates and the state of the variables at the end of the loop.

The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `n` inclusive. For each iteration, it prints two lines of output, but it does not modify the values of `n`, `t`, or `sum`. The variable `j` is the loop variable and is updated with each iteration.

Here's the loop again for clarity:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
    print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

After the loop completes, `j` will have taken on all values from 1 to `n`, and then the loop will terminate. The final value of `j` after the loop will be `n + 1` because the loop variable `j` is incremented until it reaches `n + 1`, at which point the loop condition `j < n + 1` fails and the loop exits.

The values of `n`, `t`, and `sum` remain unchanged throughout the loop as per the problem statement.

Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is:
- `n` remains the same.
- `j` is `n + 1`.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `sum` remains \(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\).

Output State: **`n` remains the same, `j` is `n + 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `sum` is \(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\).**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes, `j` will be one more than `n`, and the values of `n`, `t`, and `sum` will be the same as they were initially.
