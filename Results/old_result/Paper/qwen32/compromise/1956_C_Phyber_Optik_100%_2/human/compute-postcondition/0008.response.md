The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these two variables. The loop iterates from `2` to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `3`.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by `1` (since the loop increments `i` by `1` in each iteration), and it must still be less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `3`, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `4`.

The state of `n` must be at least `4` for the loop to execute again since `i` is now `4`.

The other variables (`t`, `sum`) are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be at least 4, `i` is 4, `sum` is increased by 15**
