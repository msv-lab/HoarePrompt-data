Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` is defined as `n + 1`.
- `t` remains unchanged, but it is not referenced in the print statement.
- `sum` is defined as \(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\), but it is also not referenced in the print statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **First Argument (`1`):**
   - The first argument in the print statement is the integer `1`.

2. **Second Argument (`n - j + 1`):**
   - `j` is defined as `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, `n - j + 1` simplifies to `n - (n + 1) + 1`, which equals `0`.

3. **Third Argument (`*range(1, n + 1)`):**
   - The `*range(1, n + 1)` part of the print statement unpacks the range of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
   - For example, if `n` is 5, `range(1, n + 1)` would be `range(1, 6)`, which is equivalent to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

### Final Output:
- The print statement will output `1`, followed by `0`, and then the numbers from `1` to `n`.

### Example:
If `n` is 5:
- `1` is printed first.
- `n - j + 1` is `0`.
- The numbers from `1` to `5` are printed next.

Thus, the output for `n = 5` would be: `1 0 1 2 3 4 5`.

### General Output:
For any `n` greater than or equal to 1, the output will be:
- `1` (first argument)
- `0` (second argument, `n - (n + 1) + 1`)
- Followed by the numbers from `1` to `n` (third argument, unpacked range)

Output: **1 0 1 2 3 ... n (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 1)**
