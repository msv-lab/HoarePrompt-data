To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the operations performed within the loop for each test case. The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the following operations are performed:

1. **Calculate the Sum:**
   - The variable `sum` is initialized to 1.
   - For each `i` from 2 to `n`, the value of `sum` is updated by adding `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`, which simplifies to `i^3 - (i - 1)^3`.
   - This effectively sums the cubes of integers from 1 to `n`, which is known to be \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\)^2 or \(\frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4}\).

2. **Print Statements:**
   - The sum and `n + n` (which is `2n`) are printed.
   - For each `j` from 1 to `n`, two lines are printed:
     - The first line prints `1`, `n - j + 1`, and the numbers from `1` to `n`.
     - The second line prints `2`, `n - j + 1`, and the numbers from `1` to `n`.

Given this understanding, after all iterations, the state of the variables will be as follows:

- `t` will be 0 because all test cases have been processed.
- `n` will be the value of the last test case processed.
- The `sum` will be the sum of cubes of integers from 1 to `n` for the last test case.
- `j` will be `n + 1` after the inner loop finishes for the last test case.

The output state after all iterations will be:

Output State: **t is 0, n is the value of the last test case, sum is the sum of cubes of integers from 1 to n for the last test case, j is n + 1.**

In simpler terms, after all test cases are processed, the loop counter `t` will be zero, `n` will hold the value from the last test case, `sum` will be the sum of cubes of integers from 1 to `n` for the last test case, and `j` will be `n + 1` as the inner loop completes for the last test case.
