Output State: **t is an input integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the n × n matrix a. The sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.**

In simple terms: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of the number of test cases, which is an integer. The other conditions about the test cases and the matrices remain unchanged.
