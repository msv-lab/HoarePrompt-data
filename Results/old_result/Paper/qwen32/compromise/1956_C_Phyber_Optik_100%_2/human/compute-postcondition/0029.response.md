Let's analyze the given task step by step.

The for loop is defined as:
```
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop starts with `i` initialized to 2 and continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.
- `sum` is increased by `i`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` and ensure that `n` is still valid for the loop to continue.

1. **Adjust `i`:** At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. However, the loop head already takes care of this increment, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration.

2. **Check `n`:** The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Since `i` is incremented at the end of each iteration, `n` must still be greater than the current value of `i` for the loop to execute again.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` must be greater than `i` for the loop to continue.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we will denote it as `i` (which is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be greater than `i`, `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, `sum` is increased by `i`**

However, since `i` is incremented at the start of the next iteration in the loop context, the correct state should reflect the value `i` will take at the start of the next iteration, which is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. But according to the problem statement, we only adjust based on the loop head, so we keep `i` as it is at the start of the next iteration in the loop context.

So the final state is:
State: **`n` must be greater than `i`, `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**
