To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the components step by step based on the initial state:

1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `n` is a variable that must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `j` is explicitly set to 1.
   - `t` remains unchanged (its value is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output).
   - `sum` is calculated using the formula \(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\), but it is not used in the print statement.

2. **The print statement:**
   - `print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))`
     - `2` is a literal integer.
     - `n - j + 1` is an expression that simplifies to `n - 1 + 1`, which further simplifies to `n`.
     - `*range(1, n + 1)` unpacks the range of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

3. **Output breakdown:**
   - The first value printed is the literal integer `2`.
   - The second value printed is `n`.
   - The third and subsequent values printed are the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Given that `n` is a variable greater than or equal to 1, the exact numerical values of `n` and the range depend on the specific value of `n`. However, we can describe the output in a general form.

For example, if `n` were 5:
- The output would be: `2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

Therefore, the most precise description of the printed output, given the initial state, is:

Output: **2, n, 1, 2, ..., n (where n is a variable greater than or equal to 1)**
