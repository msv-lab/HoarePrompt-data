To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly maximizes the sum of all elements in the matrix and whether it adheres to the constraint of using no more than 2n operations.

### Analysis:

1. **Maximizing the Sum:**
   - The program calculates the maximum sum of the matrix using the formula:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2
     \]
     This is the correct formula for the maximum sum because, for each row/column, we can place the numbers from 1 to n in such a way that each number appears exactly once in each row and each column, maximizing the sum of the matrix elements.

2. **Operations:**
   - The program generates exactly 2n operations.
   - For each row `i` from 1 to `n`, it performs two operations:
     - One Type 1 operation to fill the row with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
     - One Type 2 operation to fill the column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - These operations ensure that each row and each column is filled with the numbers from 1 to n, achieving the maximum possible sum.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program outputs the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - It then outputs the operations in the required format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and generates the required operations without exceeding the 2n operations limit. Therefore, it is a correct solution to the problem.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
