Let's carefully analyze the provided solution and the problem requirements to verify its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the sum of an `n x n` matrix using no more than `2n` operations. The operations consist of filling a row or a column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution calculates the maximum sum for the matrix and then describes a sequence of operations to achieve this sum.

#### Maximum Sum Calculation

The provided code calculates the sum as follows:
```python
sum = 1
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
```
This loop can be simplified. The term `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1))` simplifies to `2i - 1`, so the loop effectively computes:
```python
sum = 1
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    sum += (2 * i - 1) * i
```
This can be further simplified to:
```python
sum = 1
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    sum += 2 * i * i - i
```
This sum can be expressed as:
\[ \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i) \]

The correct maximum sum of the matrix, when filled with the largest possible numbers in each row and column, is the sum of the first `n` squares, which is:
\[ \text{max\_sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6} \]

However, the provided code does not directly compute this. Instead, it computes a different sum, which does not match the expected maximum sum for the matrix.

#### Operations

The solution performs `2n` operations:
1. For each row `j` from `1` to `n`, it performs:
   - Type 1 operation on row `n - j + 1` with permutation `1, 2, ..., n`.
   - Type 2 operation on column `n - j + 1` with permutation `1, 2, ..., n`.

This ensures that each row and column is filled with the permutation `1, 2, ..., n`, but the sum calculated does not match the expected maximum sum.

### Verification

1. **Maximum Sum Calculation**:
   - The maximum sum for an `n x n` matrix, where each row and column is filled with a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`, is the sum of the first `n` squares, which is:
     \[ \text{max\_sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6} \]
   - The provided code calculates a different sum, which does not match this expected value.

2. **Operations**:
   - The operations described in the code ensure that each row and column is filled with the permutation `1, 2, ..., n`, which is correct in terms of filling the matrix with the largest possible numbers.
   - However, the sum calculated does not match the expected maximum sum.

### Conclusion

The provided solution performs the correct operations to fill the matrix with the largest possible numbers, but it incorrectly calculates the maximum sum of the matrix. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Reasoning: The solution correctly performs the operations to fill the matrix with the largest possible numbers, but it incorrectly calculates the maximum sum of the matrix.
Final: **False**
