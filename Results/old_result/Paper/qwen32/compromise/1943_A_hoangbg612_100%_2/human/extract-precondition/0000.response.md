Precondition: **Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the size of the array a. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the elements of the array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.**
