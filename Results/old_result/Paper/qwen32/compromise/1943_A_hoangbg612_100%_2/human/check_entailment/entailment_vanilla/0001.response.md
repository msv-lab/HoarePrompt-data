Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to an array `c` (Alice starts first).
- Alice aims to maximize the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it.
- The game ends when `a` is empty, and the final MEX of `c` is the game's score.

### Analysis of the Program:
The given program attempts to determine the final score of the game by following these steps:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - It reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `N` is sorted to facilitate the process of finding the MEX.

3. **Tracking Elements and Their Counts:**
   - It initializes `cur` to `-1` and an empty dictionary `M` to track the counts of each element in `N`.
   - It iterates through the sorted array `N`:
     - If the current element `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if it's greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it breaks the loop, indicating that `cur + 1` is the MEX.
     - Otherwise, it updates `cur` to `num` and increments its count in `M`.
   - If all elements in `N` are accounted for up to the maximum element, it increments `cur` by 1 to find the MEX.

4. **Adjustments for MEX Calculation:**
   - It calculates the sum of counts in `M` and checks if it equals `S`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It creates a list `cnt` of keys from `M` where the count is 1.
   - If there are at least two such keys, it sets `cur` to the second smallest key in `cnt`.

5. **Output:**
   - It prints the final value of `cur`, which is supposed to be the MEX of `c` after the game ends.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not correctly simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns.
- It assumes that the MEX can be determined solely based on the sorted array and the counts of elements, without considering the strategic moves by Alice and Bob.
- The logic for adjusting `cur` based on the counts and the presence of elements with count 1 is flawed and does not correctly reflect the optimal play by Alice and Bob.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the game where:
- Alice always picks the smallest available number that maximizes the MEX.
- Bob always picks the smallest available number that minimizes the MEX.

A correct approach would involve:
- Using a frequency array or dictionary to keep track of the counts of each number.
- Simulating the turns of Alice and Bob, updating the counts and the MEX after each move.
- Ensuring that the MEX is recalculated after each player's move.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the provided program, it is incorrect for solving the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
