Let's analyze the provided code and the problem statement to determine if the code is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns to pick elements from an array `a`, with Alice aiming to maximize the MEX of the resulting array `c` while Bob aims to minimize it. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Code Analysis:
The code provided is as follows:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        cur = -1
        M = {}
        for num in N:
            if num > cur:
                if num > cur + 1:
                    cur += 1
                    break
                cur = num
                M[cur] = 1
            else:
                M[cur] += 1
        if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
            cur += 1
        cnt = []
        for k in M.keys():
            if M[k] == 1:
                cnt.append(k)
        if len(cnt) >= 2:
            cur = cnt[1]
        print(cur)
```

#### Step-by-Step Code Explanation:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `T` is read.
   - For each test case, the size of the array `S` and the array `N` are read.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The array `N` is sorted.

3. **Tracking MEX:**
   - `cur` is initialized to `-1`.
   - `M` is a dictionary to count occurrences of each number.
   - The code iterates through the sorted array `N`:
     - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it sets `cur` to `cur + 1` and breaks the loop.
     - Otherwise, it sets `cur` to `num` and initializes its count in `M`.
     - If `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in `M`.

4. **Adjusting `cur`:**
   - If the sum of the counts in `M` equals `S`, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then creates a list `cnt` of numbers that appear exactly once in `M`.
   - If `cnt` has at least two elements, it sets `cur` to the second element of `cnt`.

5. **Output:**
   - The value of `cur` is printed for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:
The logic in the code does not correctly determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally. Here are some issues:
- The code does not correctly simulate the turns between Alice and Bob.
- The logic for adjusting `cur` based on the counts in `M` and the list `cnt` does not align with the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob.
- The code does not account for the fact that Alice wants to maximize the MEX while Bob wants to minimize it.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the final score of the game when both players play optimally. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
