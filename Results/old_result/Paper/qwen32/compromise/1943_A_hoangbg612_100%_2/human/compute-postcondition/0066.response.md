The value of `cur` is updated to the value of `num`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `num` is greater than `cur`, the condition `num > cur + 1` or `num > cur` will determine the new value of `cur`. However, the code snippet only sets `cur` to `num`, so we do not need to consider the additional conditions for updating `cur` to 0 or keeping it as -1 after this assignment.

Output State: **`cur` is `num`, `M` is an empty dictionary, `S` is an input integer, `cnt` is an empty set, `T` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input and must have at least one integer, and `num` is greater than `cur`.** 

Since `cur` is now equal to `num`, the condition `num > cur` is no longer valid, and the condition `num > cur + 1` is also not relevant in this output state.
