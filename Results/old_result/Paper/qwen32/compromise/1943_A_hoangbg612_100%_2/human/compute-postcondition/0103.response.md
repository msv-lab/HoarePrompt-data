Postcondition: **`cur` is the last number in `N` plus 1 if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`; otherwise, `cur` remains the last number in `N`. `M` is a dictionary with keys as numbers from `N` and values as their respective counts. `S` is the input integer. `cnt` is a list containing all keys from `M` that have a value of 1, and the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2. `T` remains unchanged. `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input.**
