The code snippet `M[cur] = 1` updates the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M` to 1. Given that `cur` is `num`, the value associated with the key `num` in the dictionary `M` is now set to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is `num`; `M` is `{num: 1}`; `S` is an input integer; `cnt` is an empty set; `T` remains unchanged; `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input with at least two integers; `num` is the next integer in the list `N`.**
