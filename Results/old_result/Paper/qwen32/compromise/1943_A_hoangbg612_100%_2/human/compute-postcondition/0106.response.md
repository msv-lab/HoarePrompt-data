Let's break down the given initial state and determine the value of `cur` that will be printed.

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `cur` is the second element in `cnt` if the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2; otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.
   - `M` is a dictionary with keys as numbers from `N` and values as their respective counts.
   - `S` is the input integer.
   - `cnt` is a list containing all keys from `M` that have a value of 1.
   - `T` remains unchanged.
   - `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input.

2. **Determining `cnt`:**
   - `cnt` is a list of keys from `M` that have a count of 1.
   - This means `cnt` contains numbers from `N` that appear exactly once in the input.

3. **Determining `cur`:**
   - If the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `cur` is the second element of `cnt`.
   - If the length of `cnt` is less than 2, `cur` remains unchanged. However, the problem does not specify the initial value of `cur`, so we assume `cur` is not defined in this context unless `cnt` has at least two elements.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - **Scenario 1:** If `cnt` has at least two elements, `cur` will be the second element of `cnt`.
   - **Scenario 2:** If `cnt` has fewer than two elements, the problem does not specify `cur`'s value, but since we are asked to determine the printed value, we will consider the scenario where `cnt` has at least two elements for a precise answer.

Given the problem statement, we need to assume that `cnt` has at least two elements for `cur` to be defined by the second element of `cnt`.

**Conclusion:**
- The output of the print statement will be the second element of `cnt` if `cnt` has at least two elements.

Output: **cnt[1] (where cnt is a list of numbers from N that appear exactly once in the input, and cnt has at least two elements)**
