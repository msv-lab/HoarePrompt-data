The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `N`. If there are more elements in `N`, the loop will execute again, and `num` will take the value of the next element in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the last element of `N` that was processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `N` must have at least one more element. The new `num` will be the next element in the list `N`.

State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `a` is an array of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is set to `num` and `M[cur] = 1`. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1 and `M` is a dictionary with the key -1 having a value of 1.**

Since `num` was the last element processed, the new `num` will be the next element in `N`. Let's denote this next element as `num_next`.

State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `a` is an array of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is `num_next`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is set to `num` and `M[cur] = 1`. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1 and `M` is a dictionary with the key -1 having a value of 1.**
