Output State: **`cur` is either `num + 1` or `0`, `M` is a dictionary where if `num > cur`, `M` is `{num: 1}`; if `cur` is `num` after the else, `M` is `{num: 2}`; if `cur` is `-1` after the else, `M` is `{-1: 2}`, `S` is an input integer, `cnt` is an empty set, `T` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input with at least two integers, and `num` is the next integer in the list `N`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, all variables retain their initial values and states.
