The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is contained within. Therefore, the values of `cur`, `M`, `S`, `cnt`, `T`, `N`, and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is 0, `M` is an empty dictionary, `S` is an input integer, `cnt` is an empty set, `T` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input and must have at least one integer, `num` is greater than `cur + 1` and therefore greater than 1.**
