To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for num in N:`, which means we only need to adjust the state of `num` and `N`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Current State Analysis**:
   - `T` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 ⋅ 10^5.
   - `a` is an array of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n-1`.
   - `S` is an input integer.
   - `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements.
   - `num` is `num_next`.
   - Depending on the condition `if num > cur`, `cur` is updated and `M` is modified accordingly.

2. **Loop Head Variables**:
   - `num`: This variable is the current element being iterated over in the list `N`.
   - `N`: This is the list being iterated over. It remains unchanged during each iteration.

3. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `num` was `num_next`, and the loop has just finished processing this value.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `num` should be the next element in the list `N` after `num_next`.
   - Since `N` is a sorted list with at least 2 elements, we know that there is at least one more element after `num_next`.

Therefore, the next value of `num` will be the next element in the list `N` after `num_next`. Since `N` is sorted and has at least 2 elements, we can denote this next element as `N[N.index(num_next) + 1]`.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- `T` must still be greater than 0.
- `n` remains the same.
- `a` remains the same.
- `S` remains the same.
- `N` remains the same.
- `num` will be the next element in the list `N` after `num_next`.

State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `a` is an array of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is `N[N.index(num_next) + 1]`**.
