The code snippet `M = {}` reassigns the variable `M` to be an empty dictionary, discarding its previous value which was a dictionary with keys as numbers from `N` and values as their respective counts.

Output State: **`N` is sorted in ascending order; `cur` is -1; `M` is {}; `S` is the input integer; `cnt` is a list containing all keys from `M` that have a value of 1; `T` remains unchanged.**

In natural language: The list `N` remains sorted in ascending order, `cur` remains -1, `M` is now an empty dictionary, `S` remains the input integer, `cnt` is a list containing all keys from the new `M` (which is empty, so `cnt` is also empty), and `T` remains unchanged.
