Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an integer read from input, representing the size of the array `a`; `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the size of the array `a`; `a` is an array of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the elements of the array `a`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    S = int(input())
    N = list(map(int, input().split()))
    N.sort()
    cur = -1
    M = {}
    for num in N:
        if num > cur:
            if num > cur + 1:
                cur += 1
                break
            cur = num
            M[cur] = 1
        else:
            M[cur] += 1
    if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
        cur += 1
    cnt = []
    for k in M.keys():
        if M[k] == 1:
            cnt.append(k)
    if len(cnt) >= 2:
        cur = cnt[1]
    print(cur)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cur` remains the highest value in `N` that does not cause a break condition. `M` remains unchanged. `S` remains the sum of all values in `M`. `cnt` contains all keys `k` from `M` where `M[k] == 1`. If the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `cur` is set to `cnt[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cur` is the second element in `cnt` if the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2; otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. `M` is a dictionary with keys as numbers from `N` and values as their respective counts, `S` is the input integer, `cnt` is a list containing all keys from `M` that have a value of 1, `T` remains unchanged, and `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `N` is [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]; `cur` is `cnt[1]` if the length of `cnt` is at least 2, otherwise `cur` is 3 if the sum of the values in `M` is equal to `S`, otherwise `cur` remains 2; `M` is {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1}; `cnt` is a list of integers; `S` is the input integer; `T` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
