Output State: **`cur` is the highest value in `N` that does not cause a break condition, incremented by 1; `M` is a dictionary with counts of how many times each value of `cur` was encountered or incremented; the sum of all values in `M` is equal to `S`.**

Natural Language: The value of `cur` has been incremented by 1. The dictionary `M` and the sum `S` remain unchanged as the code snippet does not affect them.
