The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `N`. If `N` has at least one more integer to process, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the last integer that was processed from the list `N`.

Since `N` is a sorted list of integers and must have at least one integer, for the loop to execute one more time, `N` must have at least one more integer to process. Therefore, `num` should be the next integer in the list `N`.

State: **`cur` is either `num` or -1, `M` is a dictionary with either `{num: 1}` if `num` is greater than `cur`, or `{-1: 1}` if `num` is less than or equal to `cur`. `S` is an input integer, `cnt` is an empty set, `T` remains unchanged, and `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input and must have at least two integers. `num` is the next integer in the list `N`.**
