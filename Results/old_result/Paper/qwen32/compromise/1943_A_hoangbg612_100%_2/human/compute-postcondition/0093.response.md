Postcondition: **`M[k]` is equal to 1. `cur` is the last number in `N` plus 1 if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`; otherwise, `cur` remains the last number in `N`. `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `S` is the input integer, `cnt` is an empty list, and `T` remains unchanged. `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input and must have at least one integer.**
