The `break` statement in the provided code does not change the values of any variables; it only terminates the current loop or conditional block it is in. Given the initial state, none of the variables `cur`, `M`, `S`, `cnt`, `T`, `N`, or `num` are modified by the `break` statement.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State with the addition of the fact that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`cur` is `cur + 1`, `M` is a dictionary with either `{num: 1}` if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, or `{-1: 1}` if `num` is less than or equal to `cur + 1`. `S` is an input integer, `cnt` is an empty set, `T` remains unchanged, and `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input and must have at least two integers. `num` is the next integer in the list `N` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
