To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables `cur`, `M`, and `cnt` based on the input list `N`.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is sorted in ascending order.
- `cur` is -1.
- `M` is an empty dictionary.
- `S` is the input integer (remains unchanged).
- `cnt` is a list containing all keys from `M` that have a value of 1.
- `T` remains unchanged.

The loop iterates over each element `num` in `N`. Here's what happens in each iteration:
- If `num` is greater than `cur`:
  - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, the loop breaks.
  - Otherwise, `cur` is updated to `num`, `M[cur]` is set to 1, and `cnt` is updated to include `num` (and possibly other keys from `M` that have a value of 1).
- If `num` is less than or equal to `cur`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.

Since `N` is sorted in ascending order, the loop will update `cur` to each unique element in `N` as long as the difference between consecutive elements is at most 1. If the difference is greater than 1, the loop breaks.

### Final Output State Analysis:
1. **`cur`**: This will be the last element in `N` that was processed before the loop breaks. If the loop completes without breaking, `cur` will be the last element in `N`.
2. **`M`**: This dictionary will contain keys that are the unique elements in `N` that were processed before the loop breaks. Each key will have a value of 1 if that element was encountered for the first time, or the value will be incremented if the element was encountered multiple times.
3. **`cnt`**: This list will contain all keys from `M` that have a value of 1. Since `M` will only have keys with a value of 1 if each element in `N` was unique and processed before the loop breaks, `cnt` will be a list of these unique elements.
4. **`S`**: This remains unchanged as per the precondition.
5. **`T`**: This remains unchanged as per the precondition.

### Output State:
Let's assume `N` is `[0, 1, 2, 4, 5]` as an example. The loop will process `0`, `1`, and `2` and then break when it encounters `4` because `4` is greater than `cur + 1` (which is `3`).

Output State: **N is [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]; cur is 2; M is {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1}; cnt is [0, 1, 2]; S is the input integer; T remains unchanged.**

In natural language:
- `cur` is the last element processed before the loop breaks, which in this case is `2`.
- `M` contains the unique elements processed before the loop breaks, each with a value of 1.
- `cnt` is a list of these unique elements.
- `S` and `T` remain unchanged as per the initial state.

If the loop completes without breaking, `cur` will be the last element in `N`, and `M` and `cnt` will reflect all unique elements in `N` with a value of 1.
