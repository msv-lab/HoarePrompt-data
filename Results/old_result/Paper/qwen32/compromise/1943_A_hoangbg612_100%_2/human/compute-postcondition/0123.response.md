Postcondition: **`N` is a list containing at least one element, `T` remains unchanged, and `S` is the input integer. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num`, `M` is a dictionary with `num` as a key having the value `1`, and `cnt` is a list containing `num` (and possibly other keys from `M` that have a value of `1`). If `num` is less than or equal to `cur`, then `cur` remains -1, `M` is {-1: 1}, and `cnt` is [-1].**
