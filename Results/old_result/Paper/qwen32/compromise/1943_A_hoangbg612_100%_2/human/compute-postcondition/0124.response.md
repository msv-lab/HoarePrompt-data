The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `N`. If `N` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is a list containing at least one element, `T` remains unchanged, and `S` is the input integer. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `N` must still have at least one element. The variable `num` will be assigned the next element in the list `N`.

State: **`N` is a list containing at least one element, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is the input integer, `num` is the next element in `N`**
