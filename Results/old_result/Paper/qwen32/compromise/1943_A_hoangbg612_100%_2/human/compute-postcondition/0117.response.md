Output State: **`N` is a list containing at least one element, `cur` is 0, `M` is {}, `S` is the input integer, `cnt` is a list containing all keys from `M` that have a value of 1, `T` remains unchanged, `num` is greater than `cur`, and the current value of `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The values of the variables do not change, but the program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
