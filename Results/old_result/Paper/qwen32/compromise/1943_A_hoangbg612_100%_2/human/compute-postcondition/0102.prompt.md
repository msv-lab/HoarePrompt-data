Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur` is the last number in `N` plus 1 if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`. Otherwise, `cur` remains the last number in `N`. `M` is a dictionary with keys as numbers from `N` and values as their respective counts. `S` is the input integer, `cnt` is an empty list, and `T` remains unchanged. `N` is the sorted list of integers from the input.
Code of the loop:
for k in M.keys():
    if M[k] == 1:
        cnt.append(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cur` is the last number in `N` plus 1 if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`; otherwise, `cur` remains the last number in `N`. `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `S` is the input integer. If `M[k]` is equal to 1, `cnt` is a list containing the key `k`; otherwise, `cnt` remains an empty list. `T` remains unchanged, and `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input and must have at least one integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cur` is the last number in `N` plus 1 if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`; otherwise, `cur` remains the last number in `N`. `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `S` is the input integer, `cnt` is a list containing `k` if `M[k] == 1`; otherwise, `cnt` remains an empty list, `T` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input and must have at least one integer, `k` is the next key in `M.keys()`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cur` is the last number in `N` plus 1 if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`; otherwise, `cur` remains the last number in `N`. `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `S` is the input integer, `cnt` is a list containing `k` if `M[k] == 1`; otherwise, `cnt` includes `k` if `M[k] == 1`. `T` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input and must have at least one integer, `k` is the next key in `M.keys()` after the current `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
