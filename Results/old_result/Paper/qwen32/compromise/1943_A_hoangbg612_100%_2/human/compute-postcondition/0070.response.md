Postcondition: **`cur` is either `num` or -1, `M` is a dictionary with either `{num: 1}` if `num` is greater than `cur`, or `{-1: 1}` if `num` is less than or equal to `cur`. `S` is an input integer, `cnt` is an empty set, `T` remains unchanged, and `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input and must have at least one integer.**
