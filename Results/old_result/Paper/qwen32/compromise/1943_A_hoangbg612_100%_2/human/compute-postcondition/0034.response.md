To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes the sorted list `N` and modifies the variables `cur` and `M`.

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `cur` is initialized to -1.
   - `M` is an empty dictionary.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `num` in the sorted list `N`.
   - If `num` is greater than `cur`:
     - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is incremented by 1 and the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, `cur` is set to `num` and `M[cur]` is set to 1.
   - If `num` is not greater than `cur`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop continues until it either processes all elements in `N` or breaks when `num` is greater than `cur + 1`.

### Final Output State:

- **`cur`**: The highest integer in `N` that is less than or equal to the maximum possible value that can be reached by incrementing `cur` by 1 until `num` is greater than `cur + 1`.
- **`M`**: A dictionary where the keys are the values of `cur` encountered during the loop, and the values are the counts of how many times each `cur` was set or incremented.

### Conclusion:

After all iterations, `cur` will be the highest value in `N` that does not cause a break condition (`num > cur + 1`). The dictionary `M` will contain the counts of how many times each value of `cur` was encountered or incremented.

### Output State:

Given the above logic, the final output state is:

Output State: **`cur` is the highest value in `N` that does not cause a break condition, and `M` is a dictionary with counts of how many times each value of `cur` was encountered or incremented.**

In simpler terms, `cur` will be the highest value in `N` that is part of a continuous sequence starting from -1, and `M` will have the counts of these values.
