In this case, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely until a `break` statement is encountered within the loop body. Since there is no condition in the loop head to evaluate, we do not need to adjust any variables based on the loop condition.

Given that the loop will always execute one more time, we simply repeat the program state as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained from the input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `n` is not equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `temp * 2` is less than `k` or not; `ans` is an empty list; `temp` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `temp * 2` is less than `k` or not. If `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `i` is 1 and `temp` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 0 and `temp` is 1.**
