The given code appends zeros to the `ans` list until its length matches `n`. Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `l1` remains a new list of substrings obtained from the new input line split by whitespace.
- `n` remains the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`.
- `k` remains the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`.
- If `n` equals 1, no additional changes are made to `arr`, `k0`, `ans`, `i`, or `temp`.
- Otherwise, `arr` remains an empty list.
- `k0` remains equal to `k`.
- `ans` is updated to include additional zeros such that its length is `n`.
- `i` remains the number of times `temp` was doubled before the loop terminated.
- `temp` remains the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings obtained from the new input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; If `n` equals 1, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, `[(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1)]`, followed by `0` repeated `(n - len(ans))` times; `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before the loop terminated; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.**
