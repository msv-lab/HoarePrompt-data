In this case, the `while` loop is defined as `while True:`, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely until a `break` statement is encountered within the loop body. Since there is no condition specified in the loop head to evaluate, no adjustments to the program state are necessary to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

Therefore, the state remains the same as at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings obtained from the new input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; If `n` equals 1, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `temp * 2` is less than `k` or not; `temp` is either `temp * 2` (if `temp * 2` is less than `k`) or 1 (if `temp * 2` is greater than or equal to `k`).**
