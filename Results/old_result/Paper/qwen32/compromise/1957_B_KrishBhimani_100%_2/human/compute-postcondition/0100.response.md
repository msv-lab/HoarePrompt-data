To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and accumulates results based on the given inputs.

### Loop Execution Breakdown:
1. **Initialization**: The loop starts with reading the integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is 1, it directly prints `k` and moves to the next test case.
   - If `n` is greater than 1, it calculates the largest power of 2 (`temp`) that is less than `k`.
   - It then constructs a list `ans` of length `n` where:
     - The first element is `(1 << i) - 1` (which is `2^i - 1`), where `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before reaching the largest power of 2 less than `k`.
     - The second element is `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`.
     - The remaining elements (if any) are filled with zeros.
   - Finally, it prints the list `ans`.

### Final Output State:
After processing all `t` test cases, the program will have printed the results for each test case. The state of the program after all iterations will be that all test cases have been processed and their respective outputs have been printed. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, `ans`, `i`, and `temp` will reflect the last test case processed, but they are not retained between iterations. The main variable that remains relevant is `t`, which will be decremented to 0 after all iterations.

### Output State:
Output State: **All test cases have been processed and their respective outputs have been printed.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all iterations, the program will have printed the results for each test case, and there will be no more test cases left to process.
