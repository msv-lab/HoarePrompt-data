To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable does not directly affect the value of `k` or the print statement.
   
2. **`l1`**: A list of substrings obtained from a new input line split by whitespace. This list contains at least two elements.

3. **`n`**: The integer value of the first element of `l1`. This determines the length of the `ans` list.

4. **`k`**: The integer value of the second element of `l1`. This is the value that will be printed.

5. **`arr`**: An empty list if `n` is not equal to 1. This list is not used in the print statement.

6. **`k0`**: Equal to `k`. This variable is not used in the print statement.

7. **`ans`**: A list with `n` elements where the first two elements are `[(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1)]` and the remaining `n - 2` elements are `0`. The value of `i` is determined by the largest power of 2 that is still less than `k`.

8. **`i`**: The number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became not less than `k`. This is used to determine the first two elements of the `ans` list.

9. **`temp`**: The largest power of 2 that is still less than `k`. This is used to determine the value of `i`.

### Key Observations:

- The value of `k` is explicitly defined as the second element of the list `l1`.
- None of the subsequent operations involving `arr`, `k0`, `ans`, `i`, or `temp` modify the value of `k`.

### Conclusion:

The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`, which is the second element of the list `l1`.

### Final Output:

Output: **k (where k is the second element of the list `l1`)**
