The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` was either 0 or 1, after the increment, `i` will be either 1 or 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained from the input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `n` is not equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `i` is either 1 or 2; `ans` is an empty list; `temp` is either 2 or 4 depending on its previous value.**
