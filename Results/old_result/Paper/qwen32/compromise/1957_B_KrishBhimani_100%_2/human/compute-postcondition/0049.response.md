Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings obtained from the new input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; If `n` equals 1, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `temp` is 1; and `temp * 2` is greater than or equal to `k`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables. It only causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
