The given code snippet only initializes the variable `i` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`) are modified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained from the input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `n` is not equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `i` is 0.**
