The code snippet `n, k = list(map(int, l1))` updates the values of `n` and `k` by converting the first two elements of the list `l1` to integers. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained from the input line split by whitespace, and `n` and `k` are initially derived from the first two elements of `l1`.

After executing the code, `n` and `k` will hold the integer values of the first and second elements of `l1`, respectively. All other variables (`t`, `arr`, `k0`, `ans`, `i`, `temp`) retain their original values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings obtained from the new input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; If `n` equals 1, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list of length `n` where the first two elements are `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`, and the remaining elements are zeros; `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became greater than or equal to `k`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.**
