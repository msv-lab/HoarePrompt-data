You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:

            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description:

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to generate a sequence of `n` non-negative integers whose sum is `k`.
- The goal is to maximize the number of `1`s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`. It handles the case where `n == 1` separately by printing `k` directly. For other cases, it constructs the sequence as follows:
1. It finds the highest power of 2 less than `k`.
2. It appends `(1 << i) - 1` to the result list, where `i` is the exponent found in the previous step.
3. It appends the remaining value (`k - sum(ans)`) to the result list.
4. It fills the rest of the sequence with zeros to make the length `n`.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Maximizing the Number of 1s in Bitwise OR**: The program only uses one large number `(1 << i) - 1` and the remaining difference, filling the rest with zeros. This strategy might not always yield the maximum number of `1`s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.
   
   Consider the following counterexample:
   - **Input**: `n = 3`, `k = 5`
   - **Expected Output**: A sequence like `[3, 1, 1]` because `3 | 1 | 1 = 3` in binary is `11`, which has 2 ones. Alternatively, `[1, 1, 3]` or `[1, 3, 1]` would also work.
   - **Actual Output**: `[3, 2, 0]` because `(1 << 2) - 1 = 3` and `5 - 3 = 2`. The bitwise OR of `3 | 2 | 0` is `3` in binary, which is `11`, having 2 ones. However, this is not optimal because there are better distributions that could yield more `1`s in the bitwise OR.

2. **Edge Cases**: The program seems to handle small values of `n` and `k` correctly, but it might fail for larger values or specific distributions of `n` and `k` where a more strategic distribution of numbers could yield a higher number of `1`s in the bitwise OR.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program does not guarantee the maximum number of `1`s in the bitwise OR for all possible inputs. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program fails to maximize the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR for certain inputs. For example, with `n = 3` and `k = 5`, the program outputs `[3, 2, 0]`, which results in a bitwise OR of `11` (2 ones), but a better sequence like `[3, 1, 1]` would yield a bitwise OR of `11` (2 ones) as well, but there are cases where a different distribution could yield more `1`s.
