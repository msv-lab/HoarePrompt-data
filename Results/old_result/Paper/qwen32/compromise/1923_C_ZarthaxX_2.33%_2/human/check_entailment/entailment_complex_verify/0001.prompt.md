You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5. The array c is a list of n integers where each element c_i satisfies 1 <= c_i <= 10^9. For each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]

All other variables remain unchanged.

    #State: `ones` is a list where `ones[i]` is the count of 1's in `nums` from index 0 to `i - 1` for each `i` from 1 to `n`. `sum` is a list where `sum[i]` is the sum of elements in `nums` from index 0 to `i - 1`, with each element decremented by 1, for each `i` from 1 to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and `q`, an array `c` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i`. The function determines for each query whether a specific condition is met within the subarray from index `l_i` to `r_i` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis
We need to determine if a subarray of `c` is "good" based on the conditions:
1. The sum of the subarray equals the sum of another array `b` of the same length.
2. Each element in the subarray is different from the corresponding element in `b`.
3. All elements in `b` are positive.

### Key Observations:
- Since `b_i > 0` for every index `i`, the smallest possible sum of `b` with length `m` is `m` (when all elements are 1).
- For a subarray to be "good", the sum of the subarray must be at least `m` (the length of the subarray) because the sum of `b` must be at least `m`.
- If the subarray contains any element `1`, we can decrease it to `2` in `b` and decrease the sum of `b` by `1` while keeping the sum of `a` unchanged. Thus, we need at least `sum(subarray) - (number of 1s in the subarray) >= length of the subarray`.

### Program Analysis
The provided program follows these observations:
1. It calculates two prefix arrays:
   - `ones[i]` which is the count of `1`s in the subarray from index `1` to `i`.
   - `sum[i]` which is the sum of the subarray from index `1` to `i` minus the number of elements in the subarray (essentially, the sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray).
2. For each query, it calculates the number of `1`s and the adjusted sum for the subarray.
3. It checks if the adjusted sum is at least the length of the subarray minus the number of `1`s. If so, it prints "YES", otherwise "NO".

### Program Correctness
- The program correctly calculates the number of `1`s and the adjusted sum for each subarray.
- The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` simplifies to `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange`, which is equivalent to `sumInRange - onesInRange >= r - l + 1`. This condition ensures that the sum of the subarray minus the number of `1`s is at least the length of the subarray, which is necessary for the subarray to be "good".

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
