You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: The output state consists of printed results for each iteration of the loop, with each result being either 'NO' or 'YES' followed by the sorted or reverse sorted string `s` if 'YES' was printed. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a string of lowercase English letters. For each string, it determines if the string contains more than one unique character. If it does, the function outputs 'YES' followed by the lexicographically smallest or largest version of the string, depending on whether the string is already in lexicographically smallest order. If the string contains only one unique character, it outputs 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always generate a string `r` that is not equal to the input string `s` when possible. Specifically, the program checks if sorting the string in ascending or descending order results in a string different from the original. However, this approach can fail in certain scenarios where the original string is already sorted in ascending or descending order and cannot be rearranged into a different string by just reversing the order.

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
abac
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
bacd  # or any other permutation of "abac" that is not "abac"
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
aabc  # This is correct, but let's consider another case
```

**Another Input:**
```
1
abc
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
bca  # or any other permutation of "abc" that is not "abc"
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
abc  # This is incorrect because the output should not be the same as the input
```

In the second case, the program outputs `abc` which is the same as the input, which violates the problem statement that requires a rearranged string `r` that is not equal to `s`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
