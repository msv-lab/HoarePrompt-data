Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, meaning it will take on the value of the next integer input provided by the user. The variables `t` and `s` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
