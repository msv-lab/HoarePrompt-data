You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem of finding a simple cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge in an undirected weighted graph. However, there are several issues with the implementation that make it incorrect for some cases.

1. **Incorrect Union-Find Implementation**:
   - The code uses a `DSU` (Disjoint Set Union) class to detect cycles, but the implementation details are not provided. Assuming a standard union-find structure, the `union` method should correctly merge sets and keep track of the minimum edge weight in each set. However, the code does not properly handle the merging of sets and the tracking of the minimum edge weight.

2. **Incorrect Cycle Detection**:
   - The code sorts the edges in descending order of weight and then tries to detect a cycle by checking if two vertices are already connected. However, the logic to handle the union and find operations is flawed, and it does not correctly identify the cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge.

3. **DFS for Cycle Extraction**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to extract the cycle once a cycle is detected. However, the `dfs` function does not correctly handle the extraction of the cycle, especially when the cycle involves multiple components or when the cycle is not correctly identified.

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The code does not handle cases where the graph is not fully connected. The union-find operations should correctly handle such cases, but the current implementation does not ensure this.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4 4
1 2 10
2 3 20
3 4 30
4 1 40
```
The correct output should be a cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge, which in this case is:
```
10 4
1 2 3 4
```
However, the provided code might not correctly identify this cycle due to the issues mentioned above.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the union-find implementation, cycle detection, and cycle extraction, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
