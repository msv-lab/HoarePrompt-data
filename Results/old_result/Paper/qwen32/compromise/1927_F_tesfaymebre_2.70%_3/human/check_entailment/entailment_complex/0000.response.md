### Reasoning:

1. **Graph Construction and Edge Processing:**
   - `func_6` reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m`, then constructs the graph using an adjacency list and stores all edges in a list.
   - The edges are sorted in descending order by weight. This is not optimal for finding the minimal weight edge in a cycle, but it doesn't immediately imply incorrectness since the intention seems to be to find a cycle with the minimal weight edge.

2. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU):**
   - The DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure is used to keep track of connected components.
   - The `union` method updates the minimum edge weight for each component.
   - When processing edges, if two vertices are in the same component, the edge is considered a part of a cycle, and the minimum edge weight in the cycle is tracked.

3. **Cycle Detection:**
   - After sorting and processing the edges, the code identifies a cycle by finding the first edge that connects two vertices already in the same component.
   - It then performs a DFS starting from one of the vertices of this edge to find the cycle.

4. **Depth-First Search (DFS):**
   - The DFS function (`dfs`) is designed to find the complete cycle starting from a given vertex.
   - The function uses a `colors` list to keep track of visited nodes and returns the path once it detects a cycle (when it revisits a node that is already marked as visited).

5. **Output:**
   - The code prints the minimum weight of the edge in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It also prints the list of vertices in the cycle.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Sorting Edges in Descending Order:**
   - Sorting edges in descending order by weight is not the optimal approach for finding the cycle with the minimal weight edge. The intention should be to process edges in ascending order to ensure that the first detected cycle includes the minimal weight edge.

2. **DFS Function:**
   - The DFS function (`dfs`) is supposed to find the cycle starting from `node_u` and ending at `node_v`. However, the implementation does not ensure that the cycle includes both `node_u` and `node_v` correctly.
   - The DFS function uses a `set` to check if `node_v` is in the path, but this does not guarantee that the path is a valid cycle including both `node_u` and `node_v`.

3. **Cycle Detection and Output:**
   - The cycle detection logic is flawed because it relies on the first detected cycle, which may not be the one with the minimal weight edge due to the incorrect sorting and DFS implementation.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is not correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided. The sorting of edges in descending order and the DFS implementation are not optimal and do not guarantee the correct cycle with the minimal weight edge.

**Correctness: False**
