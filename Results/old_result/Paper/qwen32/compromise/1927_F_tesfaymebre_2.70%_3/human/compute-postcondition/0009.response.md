Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `curr` (an integer representing the current vertex), `parent` (an integer representing the parent vertex), and `path` (a list of integers representing the current path in the depth-first search). The function returns the list `path` representing the current path in the depth-first search. In some cases, it returns an empty list.**
