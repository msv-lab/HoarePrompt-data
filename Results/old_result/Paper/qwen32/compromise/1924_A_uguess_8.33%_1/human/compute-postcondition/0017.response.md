The code snippet `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments the value of `cur` by a value that is `1` shifted left by `cur_ss` positions. This means `cur` will be updated to its current value plus `2^cur_ss`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty input string; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is set to 1 and `cur` is set to 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `cur` remains unchanged. `ss` is the next character in the string `s`. `cur` is now `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`.**

In natural language: The value of `cur` is updated to its current value plus `2` raised to the power of `cur_ss`. All other variables retain their previous values.
