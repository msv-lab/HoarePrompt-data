The code snippet `ans += tmp` appends the value of `tmp` to the string `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` is a string of length `cnt` consisting of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times. After appending `tmp` to `ans`, the length of `ans` increases by 1, and the new character at the end of `ans` is `tmp`.

Output State: **`cnt` is the number of times a subset of `k` distinct characters has been encountered in `s`; `cur` is the bitmask of the last set of characters processed before the loop ends; `cnt` is less than `n`; `ans` is a string of length `cnt + 1` consisting of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times followed by `tmp`; `k` is greater than 0; `tmp` is `chr(ord('a') + i)` where `i` is the highest index less than `k` such that the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0.**
