The code snippet `cur += 1 << cur_ss` sets the bit at position `cur_ss` in the variable `cur`. Given that initially `cur` does not have the bit at position `cur_ss` set, after executing the code, the bit at position `cur_ss` will be set to 1.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty input string; `cnt` is 0; `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.**

In simple terms, the value of `cur` is now `1 << cur_ss`, which means the bit at position `cur_ss` is set to 1, and all other bits remain unchanged. All other variables retain their initial values.
