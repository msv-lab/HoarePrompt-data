Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `k` must be greater than 0, `n`, `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the total number of times the first `k` distinct characters (in any order) appear consecutively in `s`, `cur` is the state of the bit mask after processing all characters in `s`, `cnt` is less than `n`. If the i-th bit of `cur` is 0, `tmp` is set to the character 'a' + `i` and `i` is incremented by 1.**
