Postcondition: **`cnt` is the number of times a subset of `k` distinct characters has been encountered in `s`; `cur` is the bitmask of the last set of characters processed before the loop ends; `cnt` is less than `n`; `ans` is a string of length `cnt` consisting of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times; `k` is greater than 0; `i` is 4; if the 4-th bit of `cur` is 0, then `tmp` is `'e'`.**
