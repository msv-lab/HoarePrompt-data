The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`. The values of `t`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, and `i` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is the input string; `cnt` is the total number of times the first `k` distinct characters (in any order) appear consecutively in `s`; `cur` is the state of the bit mask after processing all characters in `s`; `i` is incremented by 1.**
