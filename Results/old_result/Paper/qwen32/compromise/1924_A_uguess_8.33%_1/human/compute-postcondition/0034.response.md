The code snippet provided is:
```python
tmp = ''
```

This line of code initializes a new variable `tmp` and assigns it an empty string. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`) are affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is the input string; `cnt` is the total number of times the first `k` distinct characters (in any order) appear consecutively in `s`; `cur` is the state of the bit mask after processing all characters in `s`; `cnt` is less than `n`; `tmp` is an empty string.**
