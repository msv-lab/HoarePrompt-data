Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, and `cur` are defined with specific conditions and values. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, or `cur`. It directly prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output is straightforward and does not involve any calculations or dependencies on the given variables.

Output: **YES**
