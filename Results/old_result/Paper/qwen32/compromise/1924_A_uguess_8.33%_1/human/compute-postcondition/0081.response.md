The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides some context about the variables `cnt`, `cur`, and `i`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered in sequence, and `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.
   - `cur` is 0 if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters, otherwise it is the bitmask of the last incomplete sequence.
   - `i` is `t + 1`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print('YES')` statement is executed, which simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `cnt`, `cur`, or `i`, we can directly state the output.

Output: **YES**
