Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string; `cnt` is 1; `i` is incremented by 1; `cur_ss` is an integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). The bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is set to 1. The value of `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, indicating that all the first `k` bits in `cur` are set to 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, making it equal to 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
