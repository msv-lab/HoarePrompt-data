The code snippet assigns the character `chr(ord('a') + i)` to the variable `tmp`. 

Given the initial state:
- `cnt` is the number of times a subset of `k` distinct characters has been encountered in `s`
- `cur` is the bitmask of the last set of characters processed before the loop ends
- `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0 (indicating the `i`-th character has not been set in `cur`)
- `cnt` is less than `n`
- `tmp` is an empty string
- `ans` is a string of length `cnt` consisting of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times
- `k` is greater than 0

After executing the code snippet, `tmp` will hold the character `chr(ord('a') + i)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt` is the number of times a subset of `k` distinct characters has been encountered in `s`; `cur` is the bitmask of the last set of characters processed before the loop ends; `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0; `cnt` is less than `n`; `tmp` is `chr(ord('a') + i)`; `ans` is a string of length `cnt` consisting of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times; `k` is greater than 0.**
