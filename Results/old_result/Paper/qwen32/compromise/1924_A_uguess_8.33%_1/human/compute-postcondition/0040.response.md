The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was some value such that the loop just finished executing for that value of `i`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Here is the state at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `k` must be greater than 0, `n`, `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the total number of times the first `k` distinct characters (in any order) appear consecutively in `s`, `cur` is the state of the bit mask after processing all characters in `s`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is the character 'a' + `i` if the i-th bit of `cur` is 0, and `ans` is a string consisting of the k-th letter of the alphabet repeated `cnt` times, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise, if `i` was `x` at the end of the last iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `k` must be greater than 0, `n`, `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the total number of times the first `k` distinct characters (in any order) appear consecutively in `s`, `cur` is the state of the bit mask after processing all characters in `s`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is the character 'a' + `i` if the i-th bit of `cur` is 0, and `ans` is a string consisting of the k-th letter of the alphabet repeated `cnt` times, `i` is `i + 1`**.
