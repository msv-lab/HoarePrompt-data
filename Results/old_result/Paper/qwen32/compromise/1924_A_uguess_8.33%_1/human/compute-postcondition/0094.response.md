The code snippet assigns the value of `chr(ord('a') + i)` to the variable `tmp`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2. Therefore, `tmp` will be `chr(ord('a') + 2)`, which is `chr(ord('a') + 2) = chr(97 + 2) = chr(99) = 'c'`.

The values of `cnt`, `cur`, `i`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered in sequence; `cur` is 0 if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters, otherwise it is the bitmask of the last incomplete sequence; `i` is 2; `cnt` is less than `n`; `ans` is a string of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`; `tmp` is 'c'**.
