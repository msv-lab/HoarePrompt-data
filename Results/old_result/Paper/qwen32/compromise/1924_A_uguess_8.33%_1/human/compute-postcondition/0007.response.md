The code snippet provided calculates the ASCII value difference between the character `ss` and the character 'a'. This difference is stored in the variable `cur_ss`. However, the variable `ss` is not defined in the initial state, which means we need to assume `ss` is a character from the input string `s`.

Given the initial state and the code, the output state will be updated to include the value of `cur_ss`, which is calculated as `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. The other variables remain unchanged unless `ss` is defined in the initial state, which it is not. Therefore, we can only express the output state in terms of `ss`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty input string; `cnt` is 0; `cur` is 0; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`**, where `ss` is a character from the input string `s`.
