The code snippet `s = input()` reads a string from the input and assigns it to the variable `s`. This operation does not affect the values of `cnt`, `cur`, `i`, `n`, `k`, or `m`. Therefore, the output state will include the newly assigned value for `s` and will retain the previous values for the other variables.

Output State: **`cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered in sequence; `cur` is 0 if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters, otherwise it is the bitmask of the last incomplete sequence; `i` is `t - 2`; `n`, `k`, and `m` are the integers read from the input; `s` is the string read from the input.**
