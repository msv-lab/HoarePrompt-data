The code snippet provided increments the value of the variable `ret` by 1. The other variables `t`, `len`, `s`, `i`, and `thorn` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the next character in the list `s`, `thorn` is 0, `ret` is incremented by 1.**
