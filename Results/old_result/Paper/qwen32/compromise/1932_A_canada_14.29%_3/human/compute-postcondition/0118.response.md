To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variables `ret` and `thorn` are updated in each iteration of the loop. 

The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes a string `s` of length `len` and counts the number of '@' characters encountered before encountering two consecutive '*' characters. The variable `ret` keeps track of the count of '@' characters, and `thorn` keeps track of consecutive '*' characters.

The final output state will be the cumulative result of all `t` iterations. Specifically, for each test case, the value of `ret` is printed, and this value is determined by the number of '@' characters encountered before two consecutive '*' characters are seen.

Given the information about the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the output state after all iterations will simply be the results of each individual test case printed one by one.

Since the problem does not provide specific values for `t`, `len`, and `s` for all iterations, we can only describe the final output state in terms of the cumulative results of all iterations.

Output State: **The output state after all iterations is the sequence of values of `ret` printed for each test case, where `ret` is the count of '@' characters encountered in the string `s` before two consecutive '*' characters are seen.**

In simpler terms, the final output will be a series of numbers, each representing the count of '@' characters for each test case before the condition of two consecutive '*' characters is met.
