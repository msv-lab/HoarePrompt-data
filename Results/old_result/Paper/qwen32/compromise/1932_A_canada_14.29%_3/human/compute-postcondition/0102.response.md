Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 1, `i` is the next character in the list `s`. Since `thorn` is not equal to 2, the program does not modify any of the variables and proceeds without any changes.**
