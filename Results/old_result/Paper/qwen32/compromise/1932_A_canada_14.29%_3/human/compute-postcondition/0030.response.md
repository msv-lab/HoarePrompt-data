The code snippet `ret += 1` increments the variable `ret` by 1. The initial state does not specify the initial value of `ret`, but it will be increased by 1 after the execution of the code. The other variables (`t`, `len`, `s`, `thorn`, and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `thorn` is 0, `i` is the next character in the list `s`, `ret` is increased by 1.**
