The `break` statement in the provided code will exit the innermost loop or conditional structure, but it does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `len`, `s`, `thorn`, or `i`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `thorn` is either 1, 2, or 3; `i` is the next character in the list `s` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
