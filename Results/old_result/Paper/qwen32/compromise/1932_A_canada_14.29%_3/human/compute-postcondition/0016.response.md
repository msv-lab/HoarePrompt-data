The provided code snippet `thorn == 0` is a comparison operation and does not assign any value to `thorn`. Therefore, the value of `thorn` remains unchanged. The other variables (`t`, `len`, `s`, `ret`, and `i`) are not affected by this comparison.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `ret` is 0; `thorn` is 0; the character `i` is not equal to '@' and `i` is not equal to '*'**
