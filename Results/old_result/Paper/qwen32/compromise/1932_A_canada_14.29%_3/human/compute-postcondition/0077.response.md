The task is to determine what will be printed by the `print(ret)` statement based on the initial state provided. Let's break down the variables and their roles:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. This variable seems to represent the number of test cases, but it is not directly relevant to the current print statement.
- `len` is an input integer representing the length of the string `s`.
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string.
- `ret` is the count of '@' characters in the list `s`.
- `thorn` is a variable that tracks the loop's termination condition, but it is not used in the `print(ret)` statement.

The `print(ret)` statement will output the count of '@' characters in the list `s`.

Since the exact string `s` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ret`. However, we know that `ret` is the count of '@' characters in the list `s`.

Output: **ret (where ret is the count of '@' characters in the list `s`)**
