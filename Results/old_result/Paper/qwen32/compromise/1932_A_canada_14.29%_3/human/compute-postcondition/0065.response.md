Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `thorn` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3; `i` is the next character in the list `s`. If `i` is '*', and `thorn` is 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `thorn` retains its original value of 0, 1, or 2.**
