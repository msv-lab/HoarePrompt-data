Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is either 0 or 1, and `i` is the next character in the list `s`. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is set to 1. Otherwise, `thorn` remains 0.**
