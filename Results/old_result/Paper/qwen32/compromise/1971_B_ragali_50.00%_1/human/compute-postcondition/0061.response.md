The code `a.add(i)` adds the third character of `s` to the set `a`. Given that `a` initially contains the first and second characters of `s`, after this operation, `a` will contain the first, second, and third characters of `s`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters with no leading or trailing spaces, `a` is a set containing the first, second, and third characters of `s`, `i` is the third character of `s`.**
