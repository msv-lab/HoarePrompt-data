To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the provided initial state and analyze the code step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is greater than 0 (this variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task).
- `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters with no leading or trailing spaces.
- `a` is a set containing all unique characters from `s` and the length of `a` is greater than 1 (this variable is also not used in the print statement).
- `i` is the last character of `s` (this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `newstr` is the string `s` rearranged by moving the second half to the front and the first half to the back.
- `isreverse` is the reverse of `s` (this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `newstr` is not equal to `s`.

### Code Analysis:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
```
This statement is essentially performing the same operation as the description of `newstr`. It takes the second half of the string `s` and concatenates it with the first half of the string `s`.

### Explanation:
1. **Calculate the midpoint of the string `s`**: 
   - `len(s) // 2` gives the integer division of the length of `s` by 2, which is the midpoint. If the length of `s` is odd, the second half will have one more character than the first half.

2. **Extract the second half and the first half of the string `s`**:
   - `s[len(s) // 2:]` gives the substring from the midpoint to the end of the string.
   - `s[:len(s) // 2]` gives the substring from the start of the string to the midpoint (not including the midpoint).

3. **Concatenate the second half with the first half**:
   - The concatenation of these two substrings results in the string `newstr`.

### Example:
Let's consider an example string `s = "abcdefg"`:
- Length of `s` is 7.
- Midpoint is `7 // 2 = 3`.
- Second half: `s[3:]` is `"defg"`.
- First half: `s[:3]` is `"abc"`.
- Concatenation: `"defg" + "abc"` results in `"defgabc"`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `s` rearranged by moving the second half to the front and the first half to the back, which is exactly `newstr`.

### Final Output:
Output: **newstr (where newstr is the string s rearranged by moving the second half to the front and the first half to the back)**
