You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        a = set()
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        
        a = set()
        
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: t iterations have been completed, and for each iteration, the string s was processed according to the specified conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters. It then checks if the string contains more than one unique character. If it does, it prints 'YES' and attempts to print a modified version of the string, which could be a rotated version or the reverse of the string, depending on certain conditions. If the string contains only one unique character, it prints 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, the rearrangement logic used in the program may not always produce a valid rearrangement that is different from the original string `s`.

Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and each string `s`.
2. **Unique Character Check**: The program checks if the string has more than one unique character using a set. If it does, it attempts to rearrange the string.
3. **Rearrangement Logic**:
    - The program tries to rearrange the string by splitting it into two halves and concatenating them in reverse order.
    - If this rearrangement is not different from the original string, it tries the reverse of the original string.
    - If neither of the above works, it tries another rearrangement.

However, there are cases where the program might fail to produce a valid rearrangement:

- **Case with Two Unique Characters**: Consider the string "ab". The program will split it into two halves, which results in "a" and "b". Concatenating these in reverse order gives "ba", which is different from "ab". However, the logic used might not always work for all strings with more than one unique character.
- **Case with More Than Two Unique Characters**: Consider the string "abc". The program might split it into "ab" and "c", and concatenate them in reverse order to get "cab", which is different from "abc". However, the logic might fail for other strings, such as "aabb".

A more robust approach would be to ensure that the rearranged string is different from the original string by swapping characters or using a different rearrangement strategy.

Here is a counterexample where the program might fail:
- Input: `aabb`
- Expected Output: `YES\nabab` or any other valid rearrangement
- Actual Output: The program might output `NO` or an incorrect rearrangement.

Thus, the program is not guaranteed to work for all cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
