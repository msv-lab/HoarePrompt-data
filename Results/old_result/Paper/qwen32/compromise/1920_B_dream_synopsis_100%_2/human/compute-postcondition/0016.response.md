The given code snippet modifies the variable `sums` by adding the element at index `i - 1` from the list `a` to it. Since `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, and `i` is not equal to 0, `a[i - 1]` refers to a valid element in the list.

Given the initial state, `sums` was not defined before this line, so we assume it was initialized to 0 (common practice when accumulating sums). After executing the line, `sums` will be updated to its previous value plus `a[i - 1]`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` (both at least 0), and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is not equal to 0; and `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`; `sums` is the sum of its previous value and `a[i - 1]`.**
