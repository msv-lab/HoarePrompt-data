To determine the new output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
```

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1
- `n`, `x` are integers read from the input
- `k` is an integer read from the input and is at least 0
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`
- `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`
- `i` is `i + 1`

The code modifies the value of `sums` using the elements of the list `a` at specific indices.

Here's the updated value of `sums`:
- `sums` is now equal to its previous value plus `a[i - 1]` minus twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`.

Other variables remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n`, `x` are integers read from the input, `k` is an integer read from the input and is at least 0, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `i` is `i + 1`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
