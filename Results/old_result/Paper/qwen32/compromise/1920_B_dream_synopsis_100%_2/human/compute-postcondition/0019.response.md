Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` (both at least 0), and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing one element, `sums`. If `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, `sums` is updated based on the condition: if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` is the sum of its previous value and `a[i - 1]`.**
