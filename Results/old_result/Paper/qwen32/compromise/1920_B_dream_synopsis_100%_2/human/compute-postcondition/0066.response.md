Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, where the second element is the value of `sums`; `i` is `k + 1`; `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The list `ans` now contains two elements, with the second element being the value of `sums` before the next increment. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
