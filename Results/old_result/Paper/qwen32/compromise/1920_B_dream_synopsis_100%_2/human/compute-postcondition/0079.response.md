To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic used to populate the `ans` list.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1.
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers.
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers.
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, where each element is computed based on specific rules.

### Computation of `ans`:
1. For `i = 0`, `ans[0]` is calculated as:
   \[
   ans[0] = sum1 - 2 \times \text{sum}(a[:x])
   \]
   Here, `sum(a[:x])` is the sum of the first `x` elements of the list `a`.

2. For `i > 0`, the value of `ans[i]` is updated according to the rules specified in the loop. However, the exact rules are not provided in the initial state description. Assuming typical scenarios, this could involve adjusting the sum based on certain conditions or further computations involving elements of `a`.

### Determining the Output:
The `print(max(ans))` statement will print the maximum value from the `ans` list. Since the exact values of `ans` depend on the specific values of `n`, `k`, `x`, and the contents of `a`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value without those details.

However, we can describe the output in terms of the variables and the logic:

- `ans[0]` is explicitly calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- Subsequent elements (`ans[i]` for `i > 0`) are determined by the loop logic, which isn't fully detailed here.

Thus, the output will be the maximum value among these computed elements.

### Final Answer:
Output: **max(ans) (where ans[0] = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]), and subsequent elements are determined by the loop logic)**
