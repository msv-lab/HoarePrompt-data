The code snippet calculates the sum of the elements in the list `a` and assigns this sum to the variable `sum1`. Since `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, the order of elements does not affect the sum calculation.

Given that `sum1` was initially described as "the sum of the elements in the new `a`", executing the line `sum1 = sum(a)` updates `sum1` to reflect the actual sum of the elements in `a`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, where each element is yet to be computed.**
