The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `x` are integers read from the input; `k` is an integer read from the input and is at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`; `i` is not equal to 0 and the current value of `i` satisfies the condition that (i + x - 1) < n; `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
