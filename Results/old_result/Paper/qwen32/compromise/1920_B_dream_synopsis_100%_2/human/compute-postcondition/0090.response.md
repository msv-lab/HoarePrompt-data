The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. No other variables are modified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `x` are integers read from the input; `k` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing one element, `sums`; currently `i` is 0; `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
