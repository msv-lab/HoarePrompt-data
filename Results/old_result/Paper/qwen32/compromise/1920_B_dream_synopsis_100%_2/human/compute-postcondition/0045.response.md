The given code snippet recalculates the sum of the elements in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `sum1`. Since `sum1` was already defined as the sum of the elements in `a`, executing this line does not change the value of `sum1`. Therefore, no changes occur to the state of the variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, where each element is the value of `sums` computed after each iteration of the loop.**
