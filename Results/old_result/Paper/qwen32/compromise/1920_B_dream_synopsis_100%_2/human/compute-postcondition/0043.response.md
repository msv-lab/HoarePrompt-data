The code sorts the list `a`. This means the order of the elements in `a` changes, but the sum of the elements remains the same. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `sum1`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, where each element is the value of `sums` computed after each iteration of the loop.**
