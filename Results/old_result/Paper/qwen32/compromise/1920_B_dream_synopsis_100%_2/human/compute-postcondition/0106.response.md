The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `k`, `a`, `sum1`, `i`, and `sums` remain unchanged except for `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1, `n`, `x` are integers read from the input, `k` is an integer read from the input and is at least 0, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` followed by the newly appended `sums`, `i` is `i + 1`, `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
