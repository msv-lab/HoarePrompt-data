In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the input value `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` (which is a common Python convention for a loop variable when its value is not used inside the loop) and the result of `int(input())`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to guarantee that `t` is at least 1 because the loop will iterate `t` times. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `x`, and the array `a`) are defined within the loop body and do not affect whether the loop itself will execute.

Therefore, the only state we need to adjust is ensuring that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
