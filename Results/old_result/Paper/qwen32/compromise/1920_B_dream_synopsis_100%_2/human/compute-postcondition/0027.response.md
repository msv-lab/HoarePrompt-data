Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` (both at least 0), and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, the first being `sums` and the second being either `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, or `sums` otherwise; `i` is incremented by 1.**
