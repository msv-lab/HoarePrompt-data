Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` (both at least 0), and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing three elements. If `i` was initially 0, the last element of `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, the last element of `ans` is `sums`. `i` is `i + 1`. If `i + x - 1 < n` and `i` was not initially 0, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n` and `i` was not initially 0, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
