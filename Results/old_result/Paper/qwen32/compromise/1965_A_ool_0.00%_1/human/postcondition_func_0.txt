The function `func_1` determines the winner of a game based on the configuration of stone piles provided in the input list `arr`. The list starts with the number of test cases, and for each test case, it contains the number of piles followed by the number of stones in each pile. The function returns 'Alice' if a specific condition related to the differences between the sorted unique stone counts is met, otherwise it returns 'Bob'.
