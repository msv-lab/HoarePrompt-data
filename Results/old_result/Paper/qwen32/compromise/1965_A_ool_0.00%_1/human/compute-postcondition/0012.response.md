Output State: **The program returns 'Alice' if A is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'**

Since `A` is `False` if it was `True` and `True` if it was `False`, the return statement will evaluate to 'Alice' when `A` is `True` and 'Bob' when `A` is `False`. The value of `not_c` does not affect the return value of the given code snippet.
