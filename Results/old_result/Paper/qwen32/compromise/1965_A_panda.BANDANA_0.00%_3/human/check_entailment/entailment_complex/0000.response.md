Reasoning:  
The provided program's logic is incorrect based on the problem description. The program determines the winner of the game based solely on whether the number `1` is present in the list of stones for each test case. However, this is not an accurate strategy to determine the winner when both players play optimally.

The game described is a variant of the Nim game, where the key to determining the winner is to analyze the XOR (exclusive or) of the number of stones in each pile. If the XOR of all pile sizes is zero, the position is losing for the player about to move (Alice in this case). Otherwise, it is a winning position for the player about to move (Alice).

Here's the correct logic:
1. For each test case, read the number of piles and the number of stones in each pile.
2. Compute the XOR of all the pile sizes.
3. If the XOR is zero, print "Bob" (since Alice cannot force a win from this position).
4. If the XOR is non-zero, print "Alice" (since Alice can force a win from this position).

The provided program does not implement this logic and instead incorrectly uses the presence of the number `1` to determine the winner.

Correctness: **False**
