To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it processes each test case.

The provided loop reads multiple test cases from the input, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it computes a value based on the conditions involving `n` and `k` and then prints the result.

Let's break down the logic inside the loop:
- `k // 2 + k % 2` computes the ceiling of `k / 2`.
- `k < 4 * n - 3` evaluates to `1` if true and `0` if false.
- `2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3)` computes `2 * n` if `k >= 4 * n - 3` and `0` otherwise.
- `k == 4 * n - 2` evaluates to `1` if true and `0` if false.

The expression can be interpreted as:
- If `k < 4 * n - 3`, the output is the ceiling of `k / 2`.
- If `k >= 4 * n - 3`, the output is `2 * n`.
- If `k == 4 * n - 2`, an additional `1` is added to the result.

Given the constraints, for each test case, the loop computes and prints a single integer value based on the above logic.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and prints the result immediately, the output state after all iterations will be a series of integers, each corresponding to the result of one test case.

Output State: **a series of integers, each representing the result of one test case based on the provided logic.**
