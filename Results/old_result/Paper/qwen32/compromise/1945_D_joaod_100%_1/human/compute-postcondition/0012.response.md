The code snippet `best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` updates the value of `best` to be the sum of `total` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is 1, `pos_final` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `total` is 0, `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**
