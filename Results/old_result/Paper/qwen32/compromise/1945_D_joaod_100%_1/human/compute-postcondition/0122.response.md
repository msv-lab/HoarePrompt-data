The value of `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Specifically, `t` is still an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is still greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is still at least 0, `pos_final` is still the second integer from the new input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are still lists of integers obtained from the new input, `c` is still `c + 1`, and `v` is still `na_frente - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer from the new input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers obtained from the new input, `c` is `c + 1`, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`**.
