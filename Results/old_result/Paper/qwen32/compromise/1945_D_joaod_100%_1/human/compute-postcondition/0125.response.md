Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer from the new input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers obtained from the new input, `c` is `c + 1`, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best` was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `total` is `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `total` has been updated by adding `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to it. The value of `best` remains unchanged unless it was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, in which case it is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. All other variables retain their previous values.
