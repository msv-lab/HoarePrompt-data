The code snippet assigns the variable `best` the value of `sys.float_info.max`, which is the largest possible positive floating point number in Python. This assignment does not affect any other variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is `na_frente - 1`, `pos_final` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `total` is 0, `best` is `sys.float_info.max`.**
