Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is 1, `pos_final` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, `total` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it was greater than the previous `best`, otherwise `best` remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms, the value of `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The value of `best` is updated to the new `total` if it is greater than the previous `best`; otherwise, `best` stays the same. All other variables retain their previous values.
