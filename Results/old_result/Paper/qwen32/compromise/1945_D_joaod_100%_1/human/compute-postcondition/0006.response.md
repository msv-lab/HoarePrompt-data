The code snippet `pos_final -= 1` decrements the value of `pos_final` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1; `na_frente` is `na_frente - 1`; `pos_final` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
