The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` and two lists `a` and `b` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum total cost required to reach position `m` from position `1`, considering the costs specified in lists `a` (for switching) and `b` (for passing) at each position.
