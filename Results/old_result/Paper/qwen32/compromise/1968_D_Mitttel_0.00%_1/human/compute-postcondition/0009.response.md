Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and array `a`), `k` (a positive integer representing the duration of the game), `PB` (a positive integer representing Bodya's starting position), `PS` (a positive integer representing Sasha's starting position), `p` (a list of `n` integers representing the permutation), and `a` (a list of `n` integers representing the array `a`). The function returns 'Bodya' if Bodya wins the game, 'Sasha' if Sasha wins the game, and 'Draw' if the game ends in a draw after `k` moves.**
