Postcondition: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node to reach within the tree. The tree is an adjacency list where each key is a node and its value is a list of neighboring nodes. The queue is a deque that is now empty. `visited` is a set containing the single element `start`. `current` is equal to `start`. `dist` is 0. The current value of `current` is equal to the `target`.**
