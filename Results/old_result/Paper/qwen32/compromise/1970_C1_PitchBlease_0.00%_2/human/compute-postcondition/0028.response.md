Output State: **`queue` contains at least one tuple of unvisited neighbors with their distances, `visited` contains all visited nodes including `neighbor`, `current` is the first node from the `queue` and `tree[current]` must have at least one neighbor, `dist` is the distance from the `start` to `current`, `start` and `target` remain unchanged, and `queue` has an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`.**

In natural language: The `queue` now includes an additional tuple representing the `neighbor` and its distance (`dist + 1`) from the `start`. All other variables remain unchanged.
