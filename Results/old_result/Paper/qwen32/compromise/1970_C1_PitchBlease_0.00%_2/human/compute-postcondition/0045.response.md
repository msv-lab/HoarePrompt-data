Output State: **`queue` has one less element, `visited` contains all reachable nodes including `neighbor`, `current` is a node that has at least one neighbor, `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`, `start` and `target` remain unchanged, `tree[current]` is a list with at least one element, and `neighbor` is in `visited`.**

In this output state, the only change is that `neighbor` has been added to the `visited` set, so it now contains all reachable nodes including `neighbor`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
