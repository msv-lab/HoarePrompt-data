Output State: **`queue` contains at least one tuple of unvisited neighbors with their distances, `visited` contains all visited nodes including `neighbor`, `current` is the first node from the `queue` and `tree[current]` must have at least one neighbor, `dist` is the distance from the `start` to `current`, `start` and `target` remain unchanged.**

In natural language: The `visited` set now includes the `neighbor` node. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial states.
