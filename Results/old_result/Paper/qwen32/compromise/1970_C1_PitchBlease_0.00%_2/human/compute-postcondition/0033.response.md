Postcondition: **`queue` contains at least one tuple of unvisited neighbors with their distances, including `(neighbor, dist + 1)` if `neighbor` was not in `visited`. `visited` contains all visited nodes, including `neighbor` if `neighbor` was not in `visited`. `current` is the first node from the `queue` and `tree[current]` must have at least two neighbors. `dist` is the distance from the `start` to `current`. `start` and `target` remain unchanged.**
