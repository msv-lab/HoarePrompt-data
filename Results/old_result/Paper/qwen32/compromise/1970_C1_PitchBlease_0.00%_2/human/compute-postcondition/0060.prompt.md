You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, target is an integer representing the target node to reach within the tree. The tree is an adjacency list where each key is a node and its value is a list of neighboring nodes.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: `queue` is empty, `visited` contains all reachable nodes from `start`, `current` is the `target`, `dist` is the distance from `start` to `target`, `start` and `target` remain unchanged.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `bfs` accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`, which are integers representing the starting node and the target node in a tree respectively. The tree is represented as an adjacency list. The function performs a Breadth-First Search to find the shortest path from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `start` node is the same as the `target` node, it returns 0. If the `target` node is found during the search, it returns the distance from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `target` node is not found, it returns -1.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0.

Case_2: The program returns the distance from the `start` to `current`, which is `dist`.

Case_3: The program returns the distance from `start` to `current`.

Case_4: The program returns -1


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
