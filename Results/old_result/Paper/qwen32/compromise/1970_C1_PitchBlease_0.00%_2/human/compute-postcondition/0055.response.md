Postcondition: **`queue` has the same number of elements as initially, with an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` appended if `neighbor` was not in `visited`. `visited` contains all reachable nodes, including `neighbor` if `neighbor` was not in `visited` before. `current` is a node that has at least one neighbor. `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`. `start` and `target` remain unchanged. `tree[current]` is a list with at least two elements. `neighbor` is the second element in `tree[current]`. If `neighbor` was not in `visited` initially, `visited` now includes `neighbor`.**
