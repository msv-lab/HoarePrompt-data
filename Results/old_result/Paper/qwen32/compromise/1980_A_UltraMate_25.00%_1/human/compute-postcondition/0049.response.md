The code snippet `ans += m - hmp[i]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the difference between `m` and the frequency of the character `i` in the `Counter` object `hmp`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `m` is the second integer from the input
- `s` is a non-empty string
- `p` is `'ABCDEF'`
- `hmp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each character in `s`
- `ans` is `4 * m`
- The frequency of the character `i` in `hmp` is less than `m`

After executing the code snippet:
- `ans` is updated to `4 * m + (m - hmp[i])`, which simplifies to `5 * m - hmp[i]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in `s`, `ans` is `5 * m - hmp[i]`**.
