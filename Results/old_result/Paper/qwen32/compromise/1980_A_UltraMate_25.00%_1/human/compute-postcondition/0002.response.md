The code snippet provided updates the values of `n` and `m` based on the input. Initially, `n` and `m` were defined with specific constraints, but these constraints remain valid. The new values of `n` and `m` are obtained from the user input, which are split and converted to integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `m` are integers input by the user such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.**
