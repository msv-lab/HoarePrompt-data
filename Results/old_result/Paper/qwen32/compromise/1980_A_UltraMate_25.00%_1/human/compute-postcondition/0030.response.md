In this case, the loop head only contains the variable `_` and the variable `t`. However, since `_` is a throwaway variable (commonly used in Python when the loop variable is not needed), it does not hold any state that needs to be adjusted between iterations. The loop continues as long as the range generated by `t` has more elements.

Given that the loop iterates `t` times, at the start of each iteration, the loop variable `_` would take on the next value from the range, but since we don't care about its value, we don't need to specify it. The only state that needs adjustment is `t` itself, but `t` remains constant throughout the loop, and it's the number of iterations that gets decremented implicitly.

However, to align with the requirement to specify the state at the start of the next iteration, we recognize that the loop will continue if there are still iterations left, meaning `t` should reflect the remaining count of iterations. Since the loop has just completed an iteration, we decrement `t` by 1.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is some integer greater than 0.
After one iteration, `t` is decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`**
