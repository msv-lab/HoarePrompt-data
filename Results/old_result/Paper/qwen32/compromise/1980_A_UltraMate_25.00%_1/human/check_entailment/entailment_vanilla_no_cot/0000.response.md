Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all scenarios as per the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that there are 7 distinct difficulty levels ('A' through 'G'), but it only considers 'A' through 'F'. This means that the program will not correctly calculate the number of additional problems needed if the required problems include difficulty level 'G'.

Here's the corrected part of the code:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        p = 'ABCDEFG'  # Include 'G' as well
        hmp = Counter(s)
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
            elif hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        print(ans)

func()
```

By including 'G' in the string `p`, the program now correctly checks for all required difficulty levels.
