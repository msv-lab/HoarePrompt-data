Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the stripped input string, `i` is either 0 or 1, and `work` is either True or False. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False. Otherwise, if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the first character of `b`. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` but `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`, `ans` remains the first character of `a` and `work` is True.**
