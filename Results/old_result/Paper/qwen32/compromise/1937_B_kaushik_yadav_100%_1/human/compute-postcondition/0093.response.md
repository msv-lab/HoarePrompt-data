Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is the input integer; `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with `b[0]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains the first character of `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`. The variables `work`, `j`, and `counter` maintain their respective states as described in the precondition.**
