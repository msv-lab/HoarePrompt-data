To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to understand how the variable `ans` is constructed based on the given initial state. Let's break down the information provided:

1. **`t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases)**: This indicates that there are multiple test cases, but the specific value of `t` is not directly relevant to the construction of `ans` in a single test case.

2. **`n` is an input integer**: This is an integer input, but its specific value is not directly described in the context of constructing `ans`.

3. **`a` is a non-empty string**: `a` is a string with at least one character.

4. **`b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace**: `b` is another string, and any leading or trailing spaces in the input are removed.

5. **`ans` is a string of length `len(a)` composed of characters from `a` and `b` based on the value of `work` at each step**: This means that `ans` is constructed character by character, with each character being chosen from either `a` or `b` depending on the value of `work`.

6. **`i` is `len(a)`**: `i` is set to the length of string `a`.

7. **`work` is either `True` or `False`**: The value of `work` determines whether the next character in `ans` is taken from `a` or `b`.

Given the above information, the exact content of `ans` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `a`, `b`, and the sequence of `work` values. However, we can describe `ans` in terms of these variables.

### Construction of `ans`:
- `ans` is constructed by iterating through each index of `a` (since `i` is `len(a)`).
- For each index, if `work` is `True`, the character from `a` at that index is added to `ans`.
- If `work` is `False`, the character from `b` at the same index is added to `ans`.

Since the exact sequence of `work` values is not provided, `ans` will be a string of length `len(a)` where each character is either from `a` or `b` based on the corresponding value of `work`.

### Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the constructed string `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is a string of length len(a) composed of characters from a and b based on the value of work at each step)**
