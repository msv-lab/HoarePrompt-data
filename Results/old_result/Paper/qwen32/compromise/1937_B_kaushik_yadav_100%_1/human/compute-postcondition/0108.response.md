The value of `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables maintain their previous states. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is the input integer; `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `i` is less than the length of `a` but now `i` has been incremented by 1; `work` is a boolean that can be True or False; `ans` is a string that is being constructed and now includes `b[i]` at the end; `j` and `counter` maintain their respective states as described in the precondition.
