The code snippet provided initializes a variable `ans` to an empty string. No other variables are affected by this code. The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` have certain values or properties, but these remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is an input integer; `a` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `ans` is an empty string.**
