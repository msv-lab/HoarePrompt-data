The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the stripped input string, `i` must be less than `len(a)` and `i` is now `i + 1`, `ans` is updated to include `a[i]`**.
