To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which is `i` and `len(a)` in this case.

Given the loop condition `while i < len(a)`, the loop will execute if `i` is less than the length of the string `a`. 

From the provided state:
- `t` is `t - 1`: This state is not relevant to the loop condition.
- `n` is an input integer: This state is not relevant to the loop condition.
- `a` is the stripped input string: The length of `a` is relevant to the loop condition.
- `b` is the stripped input string: This state is not relevant to the loop condition.
- `ans` is an empty string: This state is not relevant to the loop condition.
- `i` is 0: This state is relevant to the loop condition.
- `work` is True: This state is not relevant to the loop condition.

To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to make sure that `i` (which is 0) is less than `len(a)`. Since `i` is 0, `len(a)` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state of `a` needs to be adjusted to ensure it has a length greater than 0.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` must be a non-empty string, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `work` is True**
