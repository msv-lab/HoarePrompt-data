Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is less than the length of `a`. If `work` is `True`, `ans` includes the character `a[i]` appended to it. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, `work` is set to `False`. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `b[i]` is appended to `ans` and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and `work` is set to `False` if `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`. If `work` is `False`, `i` is incremented by 1 and `ans` includes the character `b[i]` appended to it.**
