To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition and the variables involved in it. The loop condition is `i < len(a)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the value of `i` is less than the length of the string `a`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a non-empty string
- `b` is the stripped input string
- `i` is the index being used in the loop
- `work` and `ans` are dependent on the conditions mentioned

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need `i` to be less than `len(a)`. The state of `i` needs to be adjusted accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the critical variable**: The critical variable for the loop condition is `i`.
2. **Determine the condition**: The loop will execute if `i < len(a)`.
3. **Adjust `i`**: To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` should be less than `len(a)`. Since the state at the end of the previous iteration is `t is t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the stripped input string, and `i` is the index being used in the loop, we need to adjust `i` to be less than `len(a)`.

### Conclusion:
The only variable that needs adjustment based on the loop condition is `i`. We need to ensure that `i` is less than `len(a)` for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the stripped input string, `i` must be less than `len(a)`**
