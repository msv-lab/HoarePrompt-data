The code snippet `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `b` to the string `ans`. Therefore, the string `ans` will now include the character `b[i]` at the end of its current value.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is the input integer; `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `i` is less than the length of `a`; `work` is a boolean that can be True or False; `ans` is a string that is being constructed and now includes `b[i]` at the end; `j` and `counter` maintain their respective states as described in the precondition.**
