Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string; `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with `b[0]`; `i` is 0; `work` is True; `i + 1` equals the length of `a`; `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]` (though `a[i + 1]` does not exist since `i + 1` equals the length of `a`); and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `i`, and `work` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
