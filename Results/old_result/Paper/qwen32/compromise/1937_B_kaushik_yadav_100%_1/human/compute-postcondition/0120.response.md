Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is the input integer; `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `work` is set to False. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` is updated to include both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] >= a[i + 1]`, `i` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is its previous value concatenated with `b[i-1]`. In all cases, `ans` is updated to include `a[i]`.**
