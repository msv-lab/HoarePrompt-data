Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is less than the length of `a` and has been incremented by 1, `work` is a boolean value, `ans` is a string that now includes the character `a[i-1]` appended to it.**

In natural language: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, making it point to the next character in the string `a`. All other variables retain their previous values. The string `ans` now includes the character that `i` was previously pointing to.
