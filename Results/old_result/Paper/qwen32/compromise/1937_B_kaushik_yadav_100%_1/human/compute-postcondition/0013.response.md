Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string; `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `ans` is the first character of `a`; `i` is 0; `work` is False; `i + 1` is less than the length of `a`; `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`.**

In this output state, the only change is that the variable `work` has been set to `False`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
