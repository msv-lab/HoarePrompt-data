The code snippet provided resets the variable `ans` to an empty string. All other variables retain their initial values and states as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is the input integer; `a` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `ans` is an empty string; `i` is `len(a)`; `work` is either `True` or `False`; `j` is the last index for which the loop condition was satisfied; `counter` reflects the number of consecutive matching characters from `a` and `b` starting from `a[1]` and `b[0]`, with the special case of resetting when `a[j + 1] == '0'` and `b[j] == '1'`.**
