The code initializes an empty list named `less`. This action does not affect the values of `t` or `loop`. Therefore, the Output State remains with `t` being an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500 and `loop` being greater than 0, with the addition of the new variable `less` which is an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is greater than 0, `less` is an empty list.**
