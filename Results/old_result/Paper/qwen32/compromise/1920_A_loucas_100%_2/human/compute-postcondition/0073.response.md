Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `iterable2` is incremented by 1. If `x` equals 1, `big` contains the value of `a`, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` equals 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` contains the value of `a`, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, and `no` contains the value of `a`.**
