Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is greater than 0, `less` is a list containing all `a` where `x` was 2, `big` is a list containing all `a` where `x` was 1, `no` is a list containing at least one element, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1` if `num` is not less than 1, otherwise `num < 1`, `innerLoop` is greater than 0. If `i` is an integer such that `i <= min(less)` and `i >= max(big)`, then `num` is specifically `min(less) - max(big)`.**
