The given code snippet appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. Based on the initial conditions:

- If `x` equals 1, `big` initially contains the value of `a`.
- If `x` does not equal 1, `big` is initially an empty list.

After executing `big.append(a)`, the list `big` will contain the value of `a` regardless of the initial condition. Here's the updated state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `big` is a list containing the value of `a`, `less` is an empty list if `x` does not equal 2, `less` contains the value of `a` if `x` equals 2, `no` is an empty list if `x` equals 2, `no` contains the value of `a` if `x` does not equal 2, `iterable2` is incremented by 1.**
