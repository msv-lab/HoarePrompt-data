It appears there is a discrepancy between the function definition provided (`def func_2():`) and the parameter constraints mentioned (`x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x <= 99 and 0 <= y <= 99`). Based on the constraints, it seems the function should accept two parameters. I'll assume the correct function definition should be `def func_2(x, y):` for the sake of this task.

Given the corrected function definition and the parameter constraints, here is the functionality:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, which are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x <= 99 and 0 <= y <= 99. The function returns the sum of `x` and `y`.**
