To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the function `func_2()`. The loop is structured as follows:

```python
for _ in range(t):
    func_2()
```

Here, `t` is the number of times the loop will execute. The loop variable `_` is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use within the loop body.

The function `func_2()` is called in each iteration of the loop, but since the function is not defined in the provided code, we can only infer that it performs some operation that does not affect the loop variable `_` or the loop's iteration count `t`.

Since the loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body, and `t` is only used to determine the number of iterations, the value of `t` itself will not change during the execution of the loop. The state of `t` will remain the same as the initial state.

Therefore, the output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**.
