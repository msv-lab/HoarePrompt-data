You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a < b else b

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` processes a number of test cases specified by the user input `t` (where `1 <= t <= 10^4`). For each test case, it calls `func_2` to perform some unspecified processing. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return a value; instead, it outputs results based on the processing of each test case.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
- Each screen is a 5x3 grid.
- There are x applications with 1x1 icons and y applications with 2x2 icons.
- Determine the minimum number of screens needed to place all icons.

### Analysis of the Provided Program
The program consists of three functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function returns the minimum of `a` and `b`. It's not used anywhere in the program.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons and calculates the minimum number of screens needed.
3. `func_3()`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_2()` for each test case.

Let's focus on `func_2()` as it contains the logic for calculating the minimum number of screens.

#### Key Points in `func_2()`
- If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
  - It calculates `bxsfory` (best x slots for y) as the ceiling of `y / 2`.
  - It then adjusts `x` by subtracting `bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` from `x`.
  - It calculates `bxsfory1` as the ceiling of `x / 15` plus 1 if `x` is greater than 0.
  - Finally, it prints `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`.
- If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0:
  - It prints the ceiling of `y / 2`.
- If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0:
  - It prints the ceiling of `x / 15`.
- If both `x` and `y` are 0:
  - It prints 0.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Slots for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The logic for calculating `bxsfory` and adjusting `x` is incorrect. The formula `bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` does not accurately represent the number of cells occupied by `y` 2x2 icons and `x` 1x1 icons.
   - A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell. The program does not correctly account for the arrangement of these icons on a 5x3 grid.

2. **Incorrect Adjustment of `x`**:
   - The adjustment of `x` by subtracting `bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. This formula does not accurately reflect the number of cells occupied by the icons.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of `bxsfory1`**:
   - The calculation of `bxsfory1` is incorrect. The program adds 1 to the ceiling of `x / 15` without considering the actual arrangement of icons on the grid.

### Example Case to Demonstrate Incorrectness
Consider the input:
```
1
15 0
```
The expected output is `1` because 15 1x1 icons can fit on a single 5x3 grid (15 cells).

However, the program calculates:
- `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(15 / 15) + 1 = 2`
- And prints `2`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for the given inputs. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
