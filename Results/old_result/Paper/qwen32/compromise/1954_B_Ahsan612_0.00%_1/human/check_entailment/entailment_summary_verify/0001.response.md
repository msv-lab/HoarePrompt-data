### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness based on the function summary and the original assessment.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Beautiful Array**: An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) (where \(2 \leq i \leq |a| - 1\)) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).
- **Task**: Find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. If it's impossible, output `-1`.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by finding the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in the array. If the array consists entirely of identical elements, it outputs `-1`.

#### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `same` is initialized to 1 to count the number of consecutive identical elements.
   - `num` is initialized to the first element of the array.
   - `minn` is initialized to infinity to keep track of the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.

2. **Iterating Through the Array**:
   - The program iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element is the same as `num`, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element is different from `num`, it updates `minn` to be the minimum of `minn` and `same`, then resets `same` to 1 and updates `num` to the current element.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, it performs a final update of `minn` with the last counted sequence of identical elements.
   - If `minn` is still infinity, it means there was no sequence of identical elements, and the program outputs `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it outputs `minn`.

#### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Logic**: The logic of the program is flawed. The variable `minn` is intended to find the minimum length of sequences of identical elements, but it does not correctly account for all sequences.
- **Edge Cases**: The program fails to handle cases where the entire array is a single sequence of identical elements. In such cases, it should output `-1` because the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.
- **Final Update**: The final update of `minn` is necessary, but the logic around it is flawed. It does not correctly reflect the minimum sequence length in all scenarios.

#### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to handle certain edge cases and does not accurately compute the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
