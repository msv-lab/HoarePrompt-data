Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `num` is `ar[i]`, `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is 1. Additionally, `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**

In the output state, the value of `num` has been updated to the value of `ar[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
