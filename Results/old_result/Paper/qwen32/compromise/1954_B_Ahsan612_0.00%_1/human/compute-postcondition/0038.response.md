Let's analyze the provided initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers.
- `i` is equal to the length of `ar`.
- `num` is the last element in `ar`.
- `minn` is not equal to infinity.
- `same` is the count of the last sequence of identical elements.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(minn)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `minn` is explicitly mentioned to be not equal to infinity. However, its exact value is not provided in the initial state.
- Since `minn` is not further defined or calculated in the provided snippet, we can only conclude that it holds a value that is not infinity.

### Conclusion:
Given that `minn` is not equal to infinity but its exact value is not specified, we can only describe it as a value that is not infinity.

### Output:
Output: **minn (where minn is a value not equal to infinity)**
