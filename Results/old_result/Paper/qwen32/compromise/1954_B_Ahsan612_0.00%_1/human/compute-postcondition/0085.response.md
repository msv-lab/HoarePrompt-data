The code snippet `minn = inf` sets the variable `minn` to the value of `inf`, which represents positive infinity in Python. This change affects only the variable `minn`, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers from the input, `i` is the length of the new `ar`, `num` is the first element of the new `ar`, `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is 1.**
