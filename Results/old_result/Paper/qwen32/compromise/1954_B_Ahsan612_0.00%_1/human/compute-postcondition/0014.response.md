The code snippet provided is `same = 1`. This statement reassigns the variable `same` to the value 1. No other variables are affected by this statement. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[2]`, `minn` is 1, `i` is 2, and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**
