The code snippet provided takes a new input and assigns it to the variable `ar`, which is a list of integers. This means the previous values of `ar`, `i`, `num`, `minn`, and `same` are overwritten or recalculated based on this new input.

- `ar` is updated to be a list of integers from the new input.
- `i` is updated to be the length of the new `ar`.
- `num` is updated to be the last element of the new `ar`.
- `minn` and `same` are not directly impacted by this line of code, so their values remain the same unless they are recalculated in subsequent code (which is not provided here), but based on the given snippet, they retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers from the input, `i` is the length of the new `ar`, `num` is the last element of the new `ar`, `minn` retains its previous value, and `same` retains its previous value.**
