Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `num` is the last element in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`, and `same` is the count of the last sequence of identical elements. The current value of `minn` is `inf`.**
