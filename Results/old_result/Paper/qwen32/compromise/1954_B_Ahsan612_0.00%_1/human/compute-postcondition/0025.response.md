To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition `i < len(ar)`.

Given the provided state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (irrelevant to the loop condition)
- `n` is an input integer (irrelevant to the loop condition)
- `ar` is a list of integers with more than 2 elements (relevant to the loop condition)
- `i` is either 3 or 4 (relevant to the loop condition)
- `num`, `minn`, and `same` are other variables (irrelevant to the loop condition)

The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `ar`.

Given that `ar` has more than 2 elements, the smallest possible length of `ar` is 3. Therefore, `len(ar) >= 3`.

Let's analyze the possible values of `i`:
- If `i` is 3, the loop will execute again if `len(ar) > 3`.
- If `i` is 4, the loop will execute again if `len(ar) > 4`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure `i` is less than `len(ar)`. Since `ar` has more than 2 elements, the smallest possible length is 3, but to ensure the loop executes again, `len(ar)` must be greater than the current value of `i`.

Therefore, the adjustments needed are:
- If `i` is 3, `len(ar)` must be greater than 3.
- If `i` is 4, `len(ar)` must be greater than 4.

Since we need to cover both cases and ensure the loop can definitely execute one more time, we can state that `len(ar)` must be at least 5 (to cover both `i` being 3 and `i` being 4).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with more than 4 elements, `i` is either 3 or 4, `num` is either `ar[0]` or `ar[2]` if `i` is 3, or `ar[3]` if `i` is 4, `minn` is either `inf` or 1 or 2, and `same` is either 2 or 3 if `i` is 3, or 1 if `i` is 4**. 

However, the only necessary adjustment related to the loop condition is the length of `ar`:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with more than 4 elements, `i` is either 3 or 4**.
