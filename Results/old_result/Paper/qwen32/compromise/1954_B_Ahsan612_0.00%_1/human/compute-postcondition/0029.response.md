To determine the output state after the execution of the given code snippet, we need to understand the impact of the statement `minn = min(minn, same)` on the variables. Since the values of `minn` and `same` are not provided in the initial state, we can only describe the general behavior of the code.

The statement `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. This means that if `same` is smaller than `minn`, `minn` will be updated to the value of `same`. If `same` is greater than or equal to `minn`, `minn` will remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers with more than 4 elements
- `i` is either 4 or 5
- `num` is `ar[i]`

The only variable that could be changed by the code snippet is `minn`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with more than 4 elements, `i` is either 4 or 5, `num` is `ar[i]`, `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`.**
