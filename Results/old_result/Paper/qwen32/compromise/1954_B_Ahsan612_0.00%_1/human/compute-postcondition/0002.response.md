The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `ar`. The variables `t` and `n` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
