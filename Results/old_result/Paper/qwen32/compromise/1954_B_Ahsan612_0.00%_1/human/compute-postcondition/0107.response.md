The code snippet increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` can be either 3 or 4. If `i` was 3, it becomes 4. If `i` was 4, it becomes 5. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers from the input with a length greater than 4. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 4, `num` remains the first element of the new `ar`, `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is 3. Otherwise, `i` is 5, `num` is updated to `ar[3]`, `minn` is set to 2, and `same` is set to 1.**
