Postcondition: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers from the input with a length greater than 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 1, `num` remains the first element of the new `ar`, `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 2, `num` becomes `ar[2]`, `minn` is 1, and `same` is 1.**
