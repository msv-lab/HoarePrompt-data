The code snippet `same = 1` sets the variable `same` to 1. This does not affect any other variables in the given initial state.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers from the input with a length greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num` is `ar[2]`, `minn` is 1, and `same` is 1.**
In simple terms, the variable `same` is reset to 1, while all other variables retain their initial values.
