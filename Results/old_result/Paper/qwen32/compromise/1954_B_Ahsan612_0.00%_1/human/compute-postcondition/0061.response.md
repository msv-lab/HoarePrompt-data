The code `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. Given that `minn` is either `inf` or `1`, and `same` is either `1` or `2`, the new value of `minn` will be `1` because `1` is the smallest possible value that `minn` or `same` can take.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 3, `num` is `ar[3]`, `minn` is 1, and `same` is either 1 or 2.**
