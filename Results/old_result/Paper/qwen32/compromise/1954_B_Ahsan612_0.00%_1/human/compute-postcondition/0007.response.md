To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute its first iteration, we need to focus on the condition `i < len(ar)`. Here, `i` is initialized to 1 and `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input.

For the loop to execute, the condition `i < len(ar)` must be true. Given that `i` is initialized to 1, `len(ar)` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Let's analyze the state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (this does not affect the loop condition).
- `n` is an input integer (this does not affect the loop condition).
- `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `same` is 1 (this does not affect the loop condition).
- `num` is `ar[0]` (this does not affect the loop condition).
- `minn` is inf (this does not affect the loop condition).
- `i` is 1.

The only state we can adjust to ensure the loop executes is the length of the list `ar`. Specifically, we need `len(ar)` to be greater than 1.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `ar` has at least 2 elements.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[0]`, `minn` is inf, `i` is 1**
