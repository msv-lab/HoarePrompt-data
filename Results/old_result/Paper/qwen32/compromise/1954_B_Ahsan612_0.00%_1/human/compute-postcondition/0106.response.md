The code snippet `same += 1` increments the value of the variable `same` by 1. Based on the initial state, `same` is either 3 or 1. Therefore, after the increment, `same` will be either 4 or 2.

All other variables remain unchanged. Here's the output state:

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers from the input with a length greater than 4. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 3, `num` remains the first element of the new `ar`, `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is 4. Otherwise, `i` is 4, `num` is updated to `ar[3]`, `minn` is set to 2, and `same` is set to 2.**
