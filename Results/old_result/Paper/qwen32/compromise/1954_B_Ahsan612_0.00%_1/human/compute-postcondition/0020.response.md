Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with more than 2 elements, `i` is 3, `num` is `ar[3]`, `minn` is either `inf` or 1, and `same` is either 1 or 2.**

Explanation: The value of `num` is updated to be `ar[3]`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
