The code snippet updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. Given the initial conditions, `minn` can either be `inf` or `1`, and `same` can either be `2` or `3`.

- If `minn` is `inf` and `same` is `2`, then `minn` will be updated to `2`.
- If `minn` is `inf` and `same` is `3`, then `minn` will be updated to `3`.
- If `minn` is `1` and `same` is `2`, then `minn` will remain `1` because `1` is less than `2`.
- If `minn` is `1` and `same` is `3`, then `minn` will remain `1` because `1` is less than `3`.

Therefore, the updated value of `minn` will be the minimum of its initial value and `same`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 4, `num` is `ar[4]`, `minn` is the minimum of its initial value and `same`, and `same` is either 2 or 3.**
