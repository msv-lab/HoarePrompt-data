### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

This condition can be rewritten as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\).

If we let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\), then \(a = d \cdot x\) and \(b = d \cdot y\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). Substituting these into the equation, we get:
\[ d \cdot x + d \cdot y = k \cdot d \cdot y \cdot d \]
\[ x + y = k \cdot d \cdot y \]
\[ x = (k \cdot d - 1) \cdot y \]

Since \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), \(k \cdot d - 1\) must be coprime with \(y\). This means that for each \(b\), we need to count the valid \(a\) values that satisfy the condition.

#### Provided Solution Analysis:
The provided solution initializes `ans` to `n` and then iterates over possible values of `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`. For each `b`, it adds `(n + b) // (b * b)` to `ans`.

However, this approach does not correctly account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The formula `(n + b) // (b * b)` does not directly relate to the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(b\) and for each \(b\), iterate over possible values of \(a\) to check if the condition is satisfied. This can be optimized using properties of gcd and divisors, but the provided solution does not follow this logic.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided solution does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
