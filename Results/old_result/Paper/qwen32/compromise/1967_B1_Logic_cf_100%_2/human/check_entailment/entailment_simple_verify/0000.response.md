### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem statement and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)
```

#### Annotations:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
- It initializes `ans` to `n`.
- It then iterates over `b` from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\) and updates `ans` by adding \((n + b) // (b * b)\).
- Finally, it prints `ans`.

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Initialization of `ans`**: The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. This is incorrect because it assumes that for every \(b\), there is always at least one valid pair \((a, b)\). However, this is not necessarily true for all values of \(b\).

2. **Logic for Counting Pairs**:
   - The loop iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\).
   - For each \(b\), it adds \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to `ans`. This formula does not correctly account for the condition that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the logic with the provided example:
- Input: \(n = 2\), \(m = 2\)
- Expected Output: 3 (Pairs: (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2))

For \(b = 1\):
- Valid pairs: (1, 1), (2, 1) => 2 pairs

For \(b = 2\):
- Valid pairs: (2, 2) => 1 pair

Total valid pairs: 3

However, the program logic does not correctly compute this. Let's check the logic for \(b = 2\):
- The program adds \((2 + 2) // (2 * 2) = 1\) to `ans`, which is correct for this specific case, but the general logic is flawed.

#### General Case:
The program does not correctly handle the general case where \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The provided formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\) does not guarantee the correct count of valid pairs for all values of \(b\).

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for all possible inputs.

**Correctness: False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
