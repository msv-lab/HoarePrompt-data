To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `b`, `n`, and `m`.

Given:
- The loop iterates over `b` from 2 to `min(n, m) + 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `b` was `b_initial + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be incremented by 1, and it must still satisfy the condition `b <= min(n, m)`.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

1. `b` should be incremented by 1, so `b` becomes `b_initial + 2`.
2. `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are part of the loop's range condition and not modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first positive integer from the input converted to an integer and must be at least 2, `m` is the second positive integer from the input converted to an integer and must be at least 2, `b` is `b_initial + 2`, `ans` is `n + (n + b_initial) // (b_initial * b_initial) + (n + b_initial + 1) // ((b_initial + 1) * (b_initial + 1))`, `T` is `t`**
