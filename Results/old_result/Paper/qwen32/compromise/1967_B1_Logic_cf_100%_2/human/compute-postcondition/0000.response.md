`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`n` and `m`) remain unchanged as they have not been assigned any values yet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer; `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6. The sum of all n and the sum of all m across all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^6.**
