To determine the new state after executing the given code snippet, let's analyze the changes:

The code snippet modifies the value of `ans` using the formula:
```
ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
```
Here, `ans` is updated based on the current value of `ans`, `n`, and `b`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `b`. Therefore, we'll express the new value of `ans` in terms of `ans`, `n`, and `b`.

Given:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `n` must be at least 2
- `m` must be at least 2
- `ans` is the first positive integer from the input

After executing the code, `ans` will be updated to:
```
ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
```

Since the values of `n` and `b` are not specified, we cannot simplify `(n + b) // (b * b)` further without additional information. However, we know that `ans` will be increased by the result of the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)`.

Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `ans` is the original `ans` plus `(n + b) // (b * b)`**
