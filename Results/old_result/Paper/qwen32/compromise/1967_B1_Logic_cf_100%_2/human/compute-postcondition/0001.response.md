To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head contains the variable `T` and the range function parameter `t`.

Given the loop:
```python
for T in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the range function generates at least one value. This happens when `t` is greater than 0. The variable `T` is the loop variable that takes on values from 0 up to `t-1`.

Since `t` is described as an input integer and the loop depends on its value, we need to ensure that `t` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0.
2. The variable `T` is initialized to 0 at the start of the first iteration and increments by 1 in each subsequent iteration until it reaches `t-1`.
3. The initial value of `T` does not need to be specified explicitly since it is controlled by the `range` function.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6**
