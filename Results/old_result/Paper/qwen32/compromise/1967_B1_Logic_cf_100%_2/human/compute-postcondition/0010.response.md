Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `b` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `ans` is updated to `ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`**

Natural Language: The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` to it. The conditions that `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, and `m` must be at least 2 remain unchanged. The variable `b` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value.
