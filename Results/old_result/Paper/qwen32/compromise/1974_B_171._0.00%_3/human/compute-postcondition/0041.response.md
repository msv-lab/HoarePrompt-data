Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `mapping` is either an empty dictionary or a dictionary with `'a'` as the key and `char` as the value, `decoded` includes the appropriate elements based on the mapping rules and now includes `mapping[char]` as its last element, `char` is the next character in the `encoded` string.**

This means that the `decoded` list now has an additional element, which is the value associated with the key `char` in the `mapping` dictionary. All other conditions remain the same.
