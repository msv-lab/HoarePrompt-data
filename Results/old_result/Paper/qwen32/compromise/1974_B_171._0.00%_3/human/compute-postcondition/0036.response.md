Postcondition: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. If `chr(c)` was not in the values of `mapping` initially, `mapping` includes a key-value pair where the key is `'c'` and the value is `char`, and `decoded` is a list containing the value `chr(c)`. If `chr(c)` was already in the values of `mapping`, no changes are made to `mapping` and `decoded`.**
