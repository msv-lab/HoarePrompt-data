Postcondition: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. If `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`, `mapping` is updated to include a new key-value pair where the key is `'a'` and the value is `char`, and an additional key-value pair where the key is `chr(c)` and the value is `char`. `decoded` is a list containing the value `chr(c)` since `chr(c)` was not in `mapping`. If `chr(c)` is already in the values of `mapping`, no changes are made to `mapping` and `decoded` remains unchanged. `char` is the next character in `encoded`.**
