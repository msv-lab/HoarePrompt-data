The only variable in the loop head is `c`, which iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`. This means `c` takes on values from 97 (ASCII for 'a') to 122 (ASCII for 'z').

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `c` is 98 (ASCII for 'b'). To execute the loop one more time, `c` should be incremented to the next value in the range, which is 99 (ASCII for 'c').

The other variables (`encoded`, `mapping`, `decoded`, `char`) are not part of the loop head and therefore should not be adjusted.

State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. `mapping` is either an empty dictionary or a dictionary with `'a'` as the key and `char` as the value. `decoded` includes the appropriate elements based on the mapping rules. `char` is the next character in the `encoded` string. `c` is 99. If `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `chr(c)` is in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` may include `'b'` as a key with `char` as the value.**
