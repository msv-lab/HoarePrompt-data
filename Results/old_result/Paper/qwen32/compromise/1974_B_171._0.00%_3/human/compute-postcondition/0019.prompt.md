Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `decoded` is an empty list, and `char` is not in `mapping`
Code of the loop:
for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
    if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
        mapping[chr(c)] = char
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. `mapping` is a dictionary. If `chr(c)` was not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` now includes the key `chr(c)` with the value `char`, `decoded` remains an empty list, and `char` is now in `mapping`. If `chr(c)` was already in `mapping.values()`, `mapping`, `decoded`, and `char` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `chr(c)` was not in `mapping.values()`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. `mapping` is a dictionary, and if `chr(c)` was not in `mapping.values()`, `chr(c)` is now included as a new key with the value `char`. `decoded` remains an empty list. `char` remains the same. `c` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `chr(c)` was already in `mapping.values()`, `mapping`, `decoded`, and `char` remain unchanged, and `c` is still incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. If `'b'` was not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` is updated to include `'b'` as a key with the value `char`. Otherwise, `mapping` remains unchanged. `decoded` remains an empty list. `char` remains the same. `c` is `ord('b')`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
