Postcondition: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. `mapping` is a dictionary. If `chr(c)` was not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` now includes the key `chr(c)` with the value `char`, `decoded` remains an empty list, and `char` is now in `mapping`. If `chr(c)` was already in `mapping.values()`, `mapping`, `decoded`, and `char` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `chr(c)` was not in `mapping.values()`.**
