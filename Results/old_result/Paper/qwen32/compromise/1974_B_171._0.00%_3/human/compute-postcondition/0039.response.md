Postcondition: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. `mapping` is either an empty dictionary or a dictionary with `'a'` as the key and `char` as the value. If `char` is in `mapping`, `decoded` includes `mapping[char]` as its last element. If `char` is not in `mapping`, `mapping` is updated to include a key-value pair where the key is the first character `chr(c)` not in the values of `mapping` and the value is `char`, and `decoded` includes `char` and `chr(c)`.**
