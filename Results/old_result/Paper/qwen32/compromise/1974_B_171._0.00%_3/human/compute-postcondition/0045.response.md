Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `mapping` is a dictionary with `'a'` as the key and `char` as the value, `decoded` includes the appropriate elements based on the mapping rules, `char` is the next character in the `encoded` string, `c` is 97 (ord('a')) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables `encoded`, `mapping`, `decoded`, `char`, and `c` remain unchanged. The code snippet `break` only affects the control flow by exiting the most internal loop or if statement.
