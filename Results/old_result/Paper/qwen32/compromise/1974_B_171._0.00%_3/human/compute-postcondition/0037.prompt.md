Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `mapping` is either an empty dictionary or a dictionary with `'a'` as the key and `char` as the value, `decoded` is a list containing either the value `mapping[char]` if `char` is in `mapping`, or `chr(c)` if `char` is not in `mapping` and `'a'` is added to `mapping` with `char` as its value, `char` is the next character in `encoded`
Code of the loop:
for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
    if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
        mapping[chr(c)] = char
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. If `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`, `mapping` is updated to include a new key-value pair where the key is `'a'` and the value is `char`, and an additional key-value pair where the key is `chr(c)` and the value is `char`. `decoded` is a list containing the value `chr(c)` since `chr(c)` was not in `mapping`. If `chr(c)` is already in the values of `mapping`, no changes are made to `mapping` and `decoded` remains unchanged. `char` is the next character in `encoded`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. If `chr(c)` was not in the values of `mapping` initially, `mapping` includes a key-value pair where the key is `'b'` and the value is `char`, and `decoded` is a list containing the value `chr(c)`. If `chr(c)` was already in the values of `mapping`, no changes are made to `mapping` and `decoded`. `char` is the next character in `encoded`. `c` is 98.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. If `chr(c)` was not in the values of `mapping` initially, `mapping` includes a key-value pair where the key is `'c'` and the value is `char`, and `decoded` is a list containing the value `chr(c)`. If `chr(c)` was already in the values of `mapping`, no changes are made to `mapping` and `decoded`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
