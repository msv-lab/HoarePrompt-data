The only object in the loop head is the variable `char`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `encoded` string. Since the loop iterates over each character in the `encoded` string, for the loop to execute one more time, `char` should be the next character in the `encoded` string.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `char` is the last character that was processed. Therefore, for the next iteration, `char` should be the next character in the `encoded` string.

Let's denote the last processed character as `encoded[k]`. For the next iteration, `char` should be `encoded[k+1]`.

State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `mapping` is either an empty dictionary or a dictionary with `'a'` as the key and `char` as the value, `decoded` includes the appropriate elements based on the mapping rules, `char` is the next character in the `encoded` string**.

Since we don't have the exact index `k` of the last processed character, we can denote the next character in the `encoded` string as `encoded[k+1]`. However, for the purpose of the state description, we can simply say `char` is the next character in the `encoded` string.
