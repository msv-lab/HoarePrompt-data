The code snippet `mapping[chr(c)] = char` updates the `mapping` dictionary by adding a new key-value pair. Here, `chr(c)` converts the integer `c` (which is 98) to its corresponding character, which is `'b'`. Therefore, the key `'b'` in the `mapping` dictionary is assigned the value of `char`.

The initial state tells us that `mapping` is either empty or contains the key `'a'` with some value `char`. After executing the given code, `mapping` will definitely contain the key `'b'` with the value `char`.

The other variables such as `encoded`, `decoded`, and `char` remain unchanged by this code snippet. The variable `c` is also unchanged.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5; `mapping` is a dictionary with `'a'` as the key and `char` as the value, and also `'b'` as the key with `char` as the value; `decoded` includes the appropriate elements based on the mapping rules; `char` is the next character in the `encoded` string; `c` is 98.**
