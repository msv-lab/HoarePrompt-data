The code appends the value associated with `char` in the `mapping` dictionary to the `decoded` list. Given that `char` is an element of `encoded` that exists in `mapping`, the value of `decoded` will be updated to include this specific value.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `decoded` is a list containing the value `mapping[char]`, and `char` is an element of `encoded` that exists in `mapping`.**
