The code snippet `mapping[chr(c)] = char` adds a new key-value pair to the `mapping` dictionary where the key is `chr(c)` and the value is `char`. Given that `c` is 99, `chr(c)` will be 'c'. Therefore, the key 'c' will be added to the `mapping` dictionary with the value `char`.

Since `char` is the next character in the `encoded` string, the exact value of `char` is not specified, but it will be assigned as the value for the key 'c' in the `mapping` dictionary.

Here is the updated state of the variables after the code execution:

- `encoded` remains a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `mapping` will now include the key-value pair `'c': char` in addition to any existing key-value pairs it had before.
- `decoded` includes the appropriate elements based on the mapping rules and remains unchanged by this specific line of code.
- `char` remains the next character in the `encoded` string.
- `c` remains 99.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5; `mapping` includes the key-value pair `'c': char` and any other previous mappings; `decoded` includes the appropriate elements based on the mapping rules; `char` is the next character in the `encoded` string; `c` is 99.**
