Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5; `mapping` is a dictionary with `chr(c)` as a new key and `char` as its value; `decoded` remains an empty list; `char` remains the same; `c` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the variables `encoded`, `mapping`, `decoded`, `char`, and `c` retain their previous values, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
