The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `ans`. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, and `win` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers where `n` and `k` are between 1 and 26, and `m` is between 1 and 1000; the string `s` is the string provided by the input; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the English alphabet; `win` is an empty set; `ans` is an empty list.**
