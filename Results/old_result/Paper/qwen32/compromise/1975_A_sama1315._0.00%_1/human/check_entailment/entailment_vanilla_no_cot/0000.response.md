Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the described operation any number of times. The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted or if it contains any decreasing pair, which is not sufficient. The key point is that the array can be split into two parts and the parts can be swapped, which means that any rotation of the array should be checked to see if it results in a non-decreasing order.

The correct approach would involve checking if there exists a point in the array where it can be split into two parts such that the second part is less than or equal to the first part and the concatenation of the two parts in reverse order results in a sorted array. This requires checking all possible rotations of the array.
