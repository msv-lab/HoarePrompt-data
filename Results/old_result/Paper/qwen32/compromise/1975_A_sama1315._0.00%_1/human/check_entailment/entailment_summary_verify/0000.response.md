### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided code does not correctly handle the problem's requirement. The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted or if there is any pair of elements that are out of order. It does not consider if swapping any prefix and suffix can result in a non-decreasing array.

The provided code does not attempt to find a valid split point where the array can be rearranged into a non-decreasing order by swapping the prefix and suffix. The correct approach, as suggested in the original assessment, involves checking all possible split points to see if the array can be rearranged into a non-decreasing order by swapping the prefix and suffix.

Let's analyze the corrected version of the function `func_1` provided in the original assessment:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        # Check if the array from i to the end is sorted and
        # the array from the start to i-1 is sorted.
        if all(arr[j] <= arr[j + 1] for j in range(i, n - 1)) and all(arr[j] <= arr[j + 1] for j in range(i - 1)):
            # Check if arr[i-1] <= arr[i] to ensure the two parts can be combined correctly.
            if i == 0 or arr[i - 1] <= arr[i]:
                return 'Yes'
    return 'No'
```

This function iterates over all possible split points `i` and checks:
1. If the subarray from index `i` to the end of the array is sorted.
2. If the subarray from the start of the array to index `i-1` is sorted.
3. If the element at index `i-1` is less than or equal to the element at index `i` (or if `i` is 0, which means there is no element before it).

If all these conditions are satisfied for any `i`, it returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be rearranged into a non-decreasing order by swapping the prefix and suffix. If no such `i` is found, it returns 'No'.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly solve the problem, and the suggested corrected version of `func_1` addresses the issue by checking all possible split points.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
