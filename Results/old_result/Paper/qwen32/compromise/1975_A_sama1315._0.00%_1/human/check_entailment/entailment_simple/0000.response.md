### Reasoning:
The given program is intended to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of prefix-suffix swaps. The logic used in the program is flawed, specifically in the function `func_1`.

Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function first checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the condition `all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`. If true, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, the function then has a redundant check `return 'No' if any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)) else 'Yes'`. This line is incorrect because it will always return 'No' if the array is not sorted, which is not the correct logic for determining if the array can be sorted by prefix-suffix swaps.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the input, processes each test case, and calls `func_1` to determine if the array can be sorted. It then collects the results and prints them.

The critical issue is in `func_1`. The correct logic should determine if the array can be split into two parts such that swapping these parts results in a non-decreasing order. The provided function does not perform this check. Instead, it incorrectly assumes that any unsorted array cannot be sorted by the allowed operation, which is not true.

### Example Analysis:
- For the input `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`, the program should return 'Yes' because it can be sorted by splitting the array into `[3, 1]` and `[4, 1, 5]`, then swapping to get `[4, 1, 5, 3, 1]` and further splitting and swapping to achieve a sorted array.
- For the input `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`, the program correctly returns 'No' because no prefix-suffix swap can sort this array.

However, the provided `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
