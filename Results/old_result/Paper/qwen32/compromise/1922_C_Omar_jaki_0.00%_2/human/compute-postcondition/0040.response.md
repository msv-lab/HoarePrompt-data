In this case, the `while` loop condition is `while t:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `t` evaluates to `True`. However, the state provided does not include the variable `t`. Since the task specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, and `t` is the only object in the loop head, we need to ensure that `t` is `True`.

Given that the state does not provide any information about `t`, we can only assume that `t` should be set to `True` to allow the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state needs to be modified to ensure `t` is `True`.

State: **[0, 0, d_1, d_1, d_1 + d_2, d_1 + d_2, ..., sum(d_1, ..., d_{n-2}), sum(d_1, ..., d_{n-2}) + d_{n-1}], u is 0, t is True**
