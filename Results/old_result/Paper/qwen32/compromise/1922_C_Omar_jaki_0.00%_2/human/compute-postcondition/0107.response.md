To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: This variable is initialized to `0`.
2. **`a`**: This is a tuple with values `(-1000000000.0, 2000000000.0)`.
3. **`b`**: This is a list `[0, 0]`.
4. **`u`**: This variable is mentioned as `u - 1`, but there is no initial value given for `u`. Since it's not used in the print statement, we can ignore it for this task.
5. **`c` and `d`**: These are the values returned by the function `r()`. The condition states that if `c < d`, then `c` is less than `d`; otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

### Code Snippet Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

Let's analyze the expression inside the `print` statement:
- `b[c * 2 - 1]`: This accesses an element in the list `b` at the index `c * 2 - 1`.
- `b[d * 2 - 1]`: This accesses an element in the list `b` at the index `d * 2 - 1`.

Given that `b` is `[0, 0]`, the only valid indices for `b` are `0` and `1`.

### Possible Values for `c` and `d`:
Since `c` and `d` are returned by `r()` and we don't have the definition of `r()`, we need to consider the constraints:
- `c * 2 - 1` must be either `0` or `1` because these are the only valid indices for `b`.
- `d * 2 - 1` must also be either `0` or `1`.

Let's evaluate the possible scenarios:
1. If `c * 2 - 1 = 0`, then `c = 0.5`, which is not an integer, so this is invalid.
2. If `c * 2 - 1 = 1`, then `c = 1`.
3. If `d * 2 - 1 = 0`, then `d = 0.5`, which is not an integer, so this is invalid.
4. If `d * 2 - 1 = 1`, then `d = 1`.

Thus, the only valid integer values for `c` and `d` are `1`.

### Evaluating the Print Statement:
- If `c = 1` and `d = 1`:
  - `b[c * 2 - 1] = b[1] = 0`
  - `b[d * 2 - 1] = b[1] = 0`
  - Therefore, `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1] = 0 - 0 = 0`

### Conclusion:
Given the constraints and the possible values, the print statement will always evaluate to `0`.

Output: **0**
