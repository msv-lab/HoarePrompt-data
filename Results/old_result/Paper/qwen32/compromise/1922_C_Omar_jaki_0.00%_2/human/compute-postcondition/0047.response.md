To determine the new state after executing the given code snippet, let's break down the operations:

The code snippet modifies the list `b` by appending two new elements:
1. `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`
2. `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`

Given the initial state:
- `a` is `[0, 1, 2, 3]`
- `u` is `0`
- `t` is `0`
- `b` is `[0, 0]`
- The list before the loop starts is `[0, 0, d_1, d_1, d_1 + d_2, d_1 + d_2, ..., sum(d_1, ..., d_{n-2}), sum(d_1, ..., d_{n-2}) + d_{n-1}]`
- `v` is `y - x`

Let's analyze the expressions:
1. `b[-2]` refers to the second last element of `b`, which is `0`.
2. `b[-1]` refers to the last element of `b`, which is also `0`.
3. `v ** (v > x - w)` evaluates to `v` if `v > x - w` is `True`, otherwise it evaluates to `1`. Since `w` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of this expression. However, for the sake of this problem, we'll keep it as `v ** (v > x - w)`.
4. `v ** (v > z - y)` evaluates to `v` if `v > z - y` is `True`, otherwise it evaluates to `1`. Similarly, since `z` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of this expression. However, for the sake of this problem, we'll keep it as `v ** (v > z - y)`.

Thus, the new elements added to `b` are:
1. `0 + v ** (v > x - w)`
2. `0 + v ** (v > z - y)`

Therefore, the updated list `b` will be `[0, 0, v ** (v > x - w), v ** (v > z - y)]`.

Output State: **`a` is `[0, 1, 2, 3]`, `u` is `0`, `t` is `0`, `b` is `[0, 0, v ** (v > x - w), v ** (v > z - y)]`, the list before the loop starts is `[0, 0, d_1, d_1, d_1 + d_2, d_1 + d_2, ..., sum(d_1, ..., d_{n-2}), sum(d_1, ..., d_{n-2}) + d_{n-1}]`, `v` is `y - x`**.
