Postcondition: **The list remains [0, 0, d_1, d_1, d_1 + d_2, d_1 + d_2, ..., sum(d_1, ..., d_{n-2}), sum(d_1, ..., d_{n-2}) + d_{n-1}]; `u` is `u - 1`; `c` is the first value returned by `r()`, and `d` is the second value returned by `r()`. The relationship between `c` and `d` is determined by the return values of `r()`: if `c` is less than `d`, then the condition `c < d` holds; otherwise, the condition `c >= d` holds.**
