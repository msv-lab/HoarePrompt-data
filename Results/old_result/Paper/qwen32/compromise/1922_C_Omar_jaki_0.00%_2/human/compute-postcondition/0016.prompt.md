Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value returned by `r()` minus 1, which satisfies \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4-1\); `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `a` is a list of `n+2` integers where the first element is `-1000000000.0`, the last element is `2000000000.0`, and the middle `n` elements are the original integers in increasing order; `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\), and for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that \(1 \leq x_i, y_i \leq n+2\) and \(x_i \neq y_i\); `r` is a lambda function that maps input to integers; `b` is `[0, 0]`.
Code of the loop:
for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    v = y - x
    b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the integer value returned by `r()` minus 1, which satisfies \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4-1\); `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `a` is a list of `n+2` integers where the first element is `-1000000000.0`, the last element is `2000000000.0`, and the middle `n` elements are the original integers in increasing order; `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\), and for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that \(1 \leq x_i, y_i \leq n+2\) and \(x_i \neq y_i\); `r` is a lambda function that maps input to integers; `b` is `[0, 0, v, v

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the integer value returned by `r()` minus 1, which satisfies \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4-1\); `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `a` is a list of `n+2` integers where the first element is `-1000000000.0`, the last element is `2000000000.0`, and the middle `n` elements are the original integers in increasing order; `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\), and for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that \(1 \leq x_i, y_i \leq n+2\) and \(x_i \neq y_i\); `r` is a lambda function that maps input to integers; `b` is `[0, 0, y - x, y - x, (y - x) + v

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the integer value returned by `r()`, satisfying \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4-1\); `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `a` is a list of `n+2` integers where the first element is `-1000000000.0`, the last element is `2000000000.0`, and the middle `n` elements are the original integers in increasing order; `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\), and for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that \(1 \leq x_i, y_i \leq n+2\) and \(x_i \neq y_i\); `r` is a lambda function that maps input to integers; `b` is `[0, 0, y - x, y - x, 2*(y - x), 2*(y - x) + (y - x)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
