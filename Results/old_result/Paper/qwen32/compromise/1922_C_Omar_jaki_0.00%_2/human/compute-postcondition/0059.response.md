The code assigns the values returned by the function `r()` to the variables `c` and `d`. Since the function `r()` and its return values are not specified, we can only denote that `c` and `d` are assigned whatever `r()` returns. The value of `u` is initially a non-zero integer and is decreased by 1 before the function call, so `u` is now one less than its initial value.

Output State: **`u` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `c` and `d` are the values returned by `r()`**.
