To solve this task, we need to understand the function `r()` that is being called. However, the function `r()` is not defined in the given context. Without knowing what `r()` does, it's impossible to determine the exact changes it would make to the variables.

Given the lack of definition for `r()`, we cannot accurately simulate its effects on the initial state. Therefore, we can only assume that `r()` does not modify any of the variables unless explicitly stated otherwise. 

If `r()` does not modify any variables, the output state would be the same as the initial state.

Output State: **[0, 0, d_1, d_1, d_1 + d_2, d_1 + d_2, ..., sum(d_1, ..., d_{n-2}), sum(d_1, ..., d_{n-2}) + d_{n-1}], u is 0, t is 0**.

This means that the list remains unchanged, and both `u` and `t` retain their initial values of 0.
