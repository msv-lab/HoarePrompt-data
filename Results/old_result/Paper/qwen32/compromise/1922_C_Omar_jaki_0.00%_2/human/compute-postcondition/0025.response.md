To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the print statement step-by-step.

### Initial State:
- The list `b` is structured as follows: `[0, 0, d_1, d_1, d_1 + d_2, d_1 + d_2, ..., sum(d_1, ..., d_{n-2}), sum(d_1, ..., d_{n-2}) + d_{n-1}]`.
- `u` is initialized to 0.
- `c` and `d` are values returned by the function `r()`, with `c` being greater than or equal to `d`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

#### Understanding Indices:
- `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` are used to access elements in the list `b`.
- Since `b` contains pairs of identical values starting from the third element, the indices `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` will point to the second occurrence of the cumulative sums `sum(d_1, ..., d_{c-1})` and `sum(d_1, ..., d_{d-1})` respectively.

#### Values at Indices:
- `b[c * 2 - 1]` corresponds to the second occurrence of the cumulative sum up to `d_{c-1}`.
- `b[d * 2 - 1]` corresponds to the second occurrence of the cumulative sum up to `d_{d-1}`.

Given that `c >= d`, the difference `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]` will be the sum of the elements from `d_d` to `d_c` (inclusive).

### Conclusion:
The print statement calculates the difference between the cumulative sums up to `d_{c-1}` and `d_{d-1}`, effectively summing the elements `d_d` through `d_c`.

Thus, the output will be the sum of the elements from `d_d` to `d_c`.

Output: **sum(d_d, ..., d_c)**
