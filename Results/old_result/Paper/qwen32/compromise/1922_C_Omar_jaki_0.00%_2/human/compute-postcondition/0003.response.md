Output State: **`t` is the integer value returned by `r()` minus 1, which satisfies \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4-1\); `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \leq 10^9\); `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\), and for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that \(1 \leq x_i, y_i \leq n\) and \(x_i \neq y_i\); `r` is a lambda function that maps input to integers.**

In simpler terms, the value of `t` has been decreased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
