To determine the Output State, let's break down the given code snippet and apply it to the Initial State.

Initial State: 
- `a` is `[0, 1, 2, 3]`
- `u` is `0`
- `t` is `0`
- `b` is `[0, 0, y - x, v]`
- `v` is `y - x`

Code Snippet:
```python
b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
```

Let's analyze the code:

1. `b[-2]` refers to the second-to-last element of list `b`, which is `y - x`.
2. `b[-1]` refers to the last element of list `b`, which is `v`.
3. `v ** (v > x - w)` evaluates to `v` raised to the power of 1 if `v > x - w` is True, otherwise it evaluates to `v` raised to the power of 0, which is 1.
4. `v ** (v > z - y)` evaluates to `v` raised to the power of 1 if `v > z - y` is True, otherwise it evaluates to `v` raised to the power of 0, which is 1.

So, the new elements being added to `b` are:
- `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w) = (y - x) + v ** (v > x - w)`
- `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y) = v + v ** (v > z - y)`

Since `v` is `y - x`, the new elements become:
- `(y - x) + (y - x) ** (v > x - w)`
- `(y - x) + (y - x) ** (v > z - y)`

Therefore, the updated list `b` will be:
- `[0, 0, y - x, v, (y - x) + (y - x) ** (v > x - w), (y - x) + (y - x) ** (v > z - y)]`

Output State: **`a` is `[0, 1, 2, 3]`, `u` is `0`, `t` is `0`, `b` is `[0, 0, y - x, y - x, (y - x) + (y - x) ** (v > x - w), (y - x) + (y - x) ** (v > z - y)]`, `v` is `y - x`**

This output state reflects the changes made to `b` while keeping other variables unchanged.
