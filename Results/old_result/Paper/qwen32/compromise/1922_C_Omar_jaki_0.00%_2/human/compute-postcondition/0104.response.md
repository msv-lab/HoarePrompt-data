The value of `u` is decremented by 1. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is 0; `a` is (-1000000000.0, 2000000000.0); `b` is [0, 0]; `u` is `u - 1`; `c` and `d` are the values returned by `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.**
