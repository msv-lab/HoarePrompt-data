To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `u` is set to 0.
- `c` and `d` are the values returned by the function `r()`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Function `r()`**: We don't have the definition of the function `r()`, but we know it returns two values, `c` and `d`.
2. **List `b`**: The list `b` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we need to assume that it exists and contains enough elements to be indexed by `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2`.

### Steps to Determine Output:
1. **Determine `c` and `d`**: Since `c` and `d` are returned by `r()`, their specific values depend on the implementation of `r()`. For the sake of explanation, let's denote them as `c` and `d`.
2. **Index Calculation**:
   - The expression `(d - 1) * 2` calculates an index into the list `b`.
   - Similarly, the expression `(c - 1) * 2` calculates another index into the list `b`.
3. **Element Access**:
   - `b[(d - 1) * 2]` accesses the element at the index `(d - 1) * 2` in the list `b`.
   - `b[(c - 1) * 2]` accesses the element at the index `(c - 1) * 2` in the list `b`.
4. **Subtraction**:
   - The print statement subtracts the element at index `(c - 1) * 2` from the element at index `(d - 1) * 2`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `c`, `d`, and the contents of list `b` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical result of the subtraction. However, we can describe the operation precisely.

Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] (where b is a list, c and d are values returned by r(), and the indices are calculated as (d - 1) * 2 and (c - 1) * 2 respectively)**
