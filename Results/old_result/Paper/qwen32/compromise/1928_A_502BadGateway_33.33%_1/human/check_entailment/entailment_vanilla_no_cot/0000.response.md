Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect. The logic in `func_1(a, b)` only checks if `b` is even and returns 'yes' if it is, otherwise 'no'. However, the problem requires a different approach to determine if Bob can form another rectangle after cutting the original rectangle.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to check if the original rectangle can be cut into two rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle. This is possible if at least one of the dimensions of the original rectangle can be evenly divided by 2, allowing it to be cut into two equal parts that can be rearranged into a new rectangle.

The correct logic should be:
- If either `a` or `b` is even, then it's possible to cut the rectangle and form a new one.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, it's not possible to form a new rectangle.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print('yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'no')
```

This version checks if either `a` or `b` is even and returns 'yes' if so, otherwise 'no'.
