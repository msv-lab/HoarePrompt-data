Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether Bob can form another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.

The current implementation only checks if `b % 2 == 0` and returns 'yes' if true, otherwise 'no'. This logic is incorrect because it only considers one possible way of cutting the rectangle (cutting parallel to the side of length `b`). It does not account for cutting parallel to the side of length `a`.

Here are some cases where the program does not work as expected:

1. **Case 1: `a = 2, b = 3`**
   - The program will return 'no' because `3 % 2 != 0`.
   - However, the rectangle can be cut into two `2x1.5` rectangles (which is not possible with integer sides), but if we consider integer sides, we can cut it into two `1x3` rectangles and then rearrange them to form a `2x3` rectangle, which is the same as the original. But we can also cut it into two `2x1` rectangles and rearrange them to form a `1x6` rectangle, which is different from the original.

2. **Case 2: `a = 4, b = 2`**
   - The program will return 'yes' because `2 % 2 == 0`.
   - However, the rectangle can be cut into two `4x1` rectangles and then rearranged to form a `2x4` rectangle, which is different from the original.

3. **Case 3: `a = 6, b = 3`**
   - The program will return 'no' because `3 % 2 != 0`.
   - However, the rectangle can be cut into two `6x1.5` rectangles (which is not possible with integer sides), but if we consider integer sides, we can cut it into two `3x3` rectangles and then rearrange them to form a `6x3` rectangle, which is the same as the original. But we can also cut it into two `6x1` rectangles and rearrange them to form a `1x18` rectangle, which is different from the original.

The correct logic should consider both possible ways of cutting the rectangle (parallel to the side of length `a` and parallel to the side of length `b`) and check if the resulting rectangles can form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This corrected program checks if either `a` or `b` is even, which is the correct condition for Bob to be able to form another rectangle.
