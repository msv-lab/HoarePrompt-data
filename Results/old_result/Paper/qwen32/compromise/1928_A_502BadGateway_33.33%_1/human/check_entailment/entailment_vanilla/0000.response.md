Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step by step.

### Problem Analysis

Bob has a rectangle of size \( a \times b \). He wants to know if he can cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides and then form a new rectangle using those two smaller rectangles. The key points are:
- The cut must be parallel to one of the sides.
- The new rectangle formed should be different from the original rectangle, considering that rotations of the same rectangle are considered identical.

### Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle

From the examples given:
- A \( 1 \times 1 \) rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles.
- A \( 2 \times 1 \) rectangle can only be cut into two \( 1 \times 1 \) rectangles, which can only form a \( 1 \times 2 \) rectangle (identical to \( 2 \times 1 \)).
- A \( 2 \times 6 \) rectangle can be cut into two \( 2 \times 3 \) rectangles, which can form a \( 4 \times 3 \) rectangle (different from \( 2 \times 6 \)).

The general idea is that a new rectangle can be formed if the original rectangle can be split into two parts such that the resulting parts can be rearranged to form a different rectangle. This is possible if at least one of the dimensions is even. Here's why:
- If \( b \) is even, we can split the rectangle into two parts of \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \). These can be rearranged to form a \( \frac{b}{2} \times 2a \) rectangle, which is different from \( a \times b \) unless \( a = \frac{b}{2} \), but in that case, the new rectangle would be the same as the original rotated.
- Similarly, if \( a \) is even, we can split the rectangle into two parts of \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \). These can be rearranged to form a \( b \times \frac{a}{2} \) rectangle, which is different from \( a \times b \) unless \( b = \frac{a}{2} \), but in that case, the new rectangle would be the same as the original rotated.

Thus, the condition for forming a new rectangle is that at least one of the dimensions \( a \) or \( b \) must be even.

### Code Analysis

The provided code checks only if \( b \) is even:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the case where \( a \) is even and \( b \) is odd. For example, a \( 2 \times 3 \) rectangle can be split into two \( 1 \times 3 \) rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a \( 3 \times 2 \) rectangle (which is the same as \( 2 \times 3 \) rotated, but the problem specifies that rotations are considered the same, so this should be considered a different rectangle).

### Correct Condition

The correct condition should be that at least one of the dimensions \( a \) or \( b \) must be even:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

### Conclusion

The provided code does not correctly determine if a new rectangle can be formed. It only checks if \( b \) is even, missing the cases where \( a \) is even and \( b \) is odd.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
