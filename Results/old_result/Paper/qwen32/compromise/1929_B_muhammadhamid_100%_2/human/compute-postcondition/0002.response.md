Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers, `n` and `k`. The integer `n` represents the size of a square grid, and `k` represents the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell. The function returns a value indicating whether it is possible to color at least one cell in the grid such that at least `k` diagonals contain at least one colored cell.**
