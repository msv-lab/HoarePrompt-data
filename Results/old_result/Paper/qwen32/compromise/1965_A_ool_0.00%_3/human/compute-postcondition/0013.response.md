Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The first element `t` of `arr` represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of piles, followed by `n` integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The function returns 'Alice' if either the first condition is met or if the final value of `A` is True. Otherwise, it returns 'Bob'.**
