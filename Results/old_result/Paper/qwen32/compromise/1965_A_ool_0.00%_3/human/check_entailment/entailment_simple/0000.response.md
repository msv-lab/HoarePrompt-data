### Reasoning:

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Input:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t` correctly but then incorrectly reads the rest of the input. It reads a single line for `n` and the next line for `arr`. However, `n` should be an integer representing the number of piles, and `arr` should be the list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile. The current code does not correctly separate `n` and `arr` for each test case.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner:**
   - The function `func_1` contains incorrect logic to determine the winner. The logic provided is not based on the game rules described. Specifically:
     - The function checks if `arr[0]` is not equal to 1 and returns 'Alice' immediately. This is incorrect because the first element of `arr` is not `t` (number of test cases) but rather `n` (number of piles) in the context of each test case.
     - The function then creates a set of unique elements from `arr` and sorts them. It checks the differences between consecutive elements in this sorted set to determine the winner. This logic does not align with the game rules, which involve the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones.

3. **Correct Logic for the Game:**
   - According to the problem statement, the winner can be determined by counting the number of piles with an odd number of stones. If this count is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. This is because the game is a variant of the Nim game, and the winning strategy is based on the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones.

### Correctness:

Given the above issues, the provided code is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
