#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of k distinct integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k ≤ 100; b is a list of q integers where 1 ≤ q ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 100 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ q.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a <= b) :
        return a - 1
        #The program returns a new list where each element is 1 less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`.
    else :
        return b
        #The program returns the list `b` which contains `q` integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 inclusive.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two lists as input: `a`, a list of `k` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, and `b`, a list of `q` integers. It compares the lists `a` and `b`. If `a` is lexicographically less than or equal to `b`, it returns a new list where each element of `a` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, it returns the list `b`.
