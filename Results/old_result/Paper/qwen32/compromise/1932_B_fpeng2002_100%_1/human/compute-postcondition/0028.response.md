The `while` loop condition is `num_tests > 0`. Therefore, the only variable that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute one more time is `num_tests`.

Given that `num_tests` is currently 0, we need to set it to a value greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, we can simply set `num_tests` to 1.

No other variables (`n`, `nums`, `start_year`, or `x`) need to be adjusted because they do not appear in the loop condition.

State: **`num_tests` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input line split by spaces, `start_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `nums`, `x` is len(nums) - 1**
