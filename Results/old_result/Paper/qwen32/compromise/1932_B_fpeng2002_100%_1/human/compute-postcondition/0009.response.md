The code modifies the `start_year` variable by setting it to `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This calculation ensures that `start_year` becomes the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the current `start_year`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `num_tests` must be greater than 0 and is decreased by 1
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `nums` is a list of `n` integers `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]`
- `x` is `x + 1`
- `start_year` is `nums[x]`

After the code executes:
- `start_year` is updated to `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`
- All other variables remain unchanged

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `num_tests` is decreased by 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `nums` is a list of `n` integers `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]`, `x` is `x + 1`, `start_year` is `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`**
