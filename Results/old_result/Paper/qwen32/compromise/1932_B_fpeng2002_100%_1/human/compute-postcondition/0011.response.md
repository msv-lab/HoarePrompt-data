Output State: **`x` is `x + 1`, `start_year` is `((start_year // nums[x - 1] + 1) * nums[x - 1])`**

Explanation: The value of `x` is incremented by 1. The `start_year` is recalculated using the previous value of `x` (which is `x - 1` in the context of the calculation), making `start_year` equal to `((start_year // nums[x - 1] + 1) * nums[x - 1])`. Other variables remain unchanged.
