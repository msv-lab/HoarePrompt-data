Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `num_tests` is 0 (this variable is not used in the provided code snippet, so it doesn't affect the output).
   - `n` is an input integer. The exact value of `n` is not specified, but it is the number of elements in the list `nums`.
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input line split by spaces. The exact values of the integers in `nums` are not specified.
   - `start_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `nums`.
   - `x` is `len(nums) - 1` (this variable is not used in the provided code snippet, so it doesn't affect the output).

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(start_year)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `start_year` is defined as the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in the list `nums`.
   - Since the exact values of the integers in `nums` are not specified, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `start_year`.
   - However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated LCM of the elements in the list `nums`.

4. **Output:**
   The `print(start_year)` statement will print the calculated least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in the list `nums`.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **start_year (where start_year is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in the list `nums`)**
