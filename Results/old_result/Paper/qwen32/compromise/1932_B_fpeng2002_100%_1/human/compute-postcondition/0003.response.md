The code snippet reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This operation does not affect the other variables `t`, `num_tests`, or the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` for the current test case. The value of `num_tests` is decreased by 1 in the initial state, but this operation is not reflected in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `num_tests` must be greater than 0 and is decreased by 1; For each test case, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.**
