The code snippet reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `num_tests`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `num_tests` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.**
