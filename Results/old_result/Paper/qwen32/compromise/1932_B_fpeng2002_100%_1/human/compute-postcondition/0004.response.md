The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `nums`. This means `nums` will now hold the list of integers provided in the input.

Given the initial state, `n` is the number of integers that are expected in the input, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are these integers. After the execution of the code, `nums` will be equal to `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]`. The values of `t`, `num_tests`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `num_tests` must be greater than 0 and is decreased by 1; For each test case, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.**
