The code modifies the value of `start_year` based on the current values of `start_year`, `nums`, and `x`. Given that `start_year` is initially 0, `nums` is a list of integers, and `x` is 0, the expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` evaluates to `(0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`, which simplifies to `1 * nums[0]` or simply `nums[0]`.

Thus, `start_year` is updated to the first element of the `nums` list. The values of `num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input line split by spaces and must have at least 1 integer, `start_year` is `nums[0]`, `x` is 0**.
