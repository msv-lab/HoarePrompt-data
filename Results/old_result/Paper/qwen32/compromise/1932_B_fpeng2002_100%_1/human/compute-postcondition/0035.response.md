The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the range defined by `len(nums)`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x` and the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 0, and `nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` should be incremented by 1.

Given that `nums` must have at least 1 integer, the loop will execute at least once. After the first iteration, `x` will be 1, and the loop will continue as long as `x` is less than the length of `nums`.

State: **`num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line and must have at least 1 integer, `start_year` is `nums[0]`, `x` is 1**
