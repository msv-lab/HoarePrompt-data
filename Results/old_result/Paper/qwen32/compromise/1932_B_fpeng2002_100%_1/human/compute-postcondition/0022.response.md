The only variables in the loop head are `x` and the range parameters `0` and `len(nums)`. Since the range is defined by the length of `nums`, and `nums` is not being modified within the loop, we only need to adjust `x` for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be incremented by 1, so `x` should be 1.

The states of `num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, `start_year` do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input line split by spaces and must have at least 1 integer, `start_year` is `nums[0]`, `x` is 1**
