### Reasoning:

The given program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen according to the problem description. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program first reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. **Calculation of the Year for Each Sign**:
   - The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0. This variable keeps track of the year from which the next sign should start appearing.
   - For each sign (periodicity `x` in `nums`), the program calculates the year in which the next sign appears. This is done using the formula: `start_year = (start_year // x + 1) * x`.
     - `start_year // x` gives the number of complete cycles of `x` that have passed up to `start_year`.
     - Adding 1 to this result and multiplying by `x` gives the next occurrence of the sign after `start_year`.
   - This process is repeated for all signs, updating `start_year` each time to the year of the next sign's occurrence.

3. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the year in which the n-th sign occurs, which is the year of the apocalypse.

The logic correctly reflects the sequential nature of the signs' occurrences as described in the problem statement. The provided example inputs and their corresponding outputs match the program's logic and calculations.
