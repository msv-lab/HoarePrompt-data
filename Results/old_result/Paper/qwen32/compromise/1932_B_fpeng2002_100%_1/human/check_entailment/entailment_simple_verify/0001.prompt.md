You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Understanding the Problem
The problem requires finding the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse occurs, given that each sign occurs at regular intervals and must occur sequentially.

### Analysis of the Program
The program follows these steps:
1. Reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Reads the number of signs `n`.
   - Reads the periodicities of the signs into a list `nums`.
   - Initializes `start_year` to 0.
   - Iterates over each sign's periodicity:
     - Updates `start_year` to the next occurrence of the current sign after `start_year`.
     - This is done by computing `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, which finds the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.
   - Prints the final `start_year` after processing all signs.

### Verification
Let's verify the program with the given example:

#### Example Input:
```
4
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
5
1 2 3 4 5
5
1 1 1 1 1
6
50 30 711 200 503 1006
```

#### Example Output:
```
36
5
5
2012
```

- **First Test Case**: 
  - The program calculates the years as follows:
    - `start_year` starts at 0.
    - For the first sign (period 3): `(0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
    - For the second sign (period 2): `(3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
    - For the third sign (period 4): `(4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
    - For the fourth sign (period 5): `(8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
    - For the fifth sign (period 9): `(10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
    - For the sixth sign (period 18): `(18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
  - The output is `36`, which matches the example.

- **Second Test Case**: 
  - The program calculates the years as follows:
    - `start_year` starts at 0.
    - For the first sign (period 1): `(0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
    - For the second sign (period 2): `(1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`
    - For the third sign (period 3): `(2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
    - For the fourth sign (period 4): `(3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`
    - For the fifth sign (period 5): `(4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`
  - The output is `5`, which matches the example.

- **Third Test Case**: 
  - The program calculates the years as follows:
    - `start_year` starts at 0.
    - For each sign (period 1): `(start_year // 1 + 1) * 1 = start_year + 1`
  - The output is `5`, which matches the example.

- **Fourth Test Case**: 
  - The program calculates the years as follows:
    - `start_year` starts at 0.
    - For the first sign (period 50): `(0 // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
    - For the second sign (period 30): `(50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = 60`
    - For the third sign (period 711): `(60 // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
    - For the fourth sign (period 200): `(711 // 200 + 1) * 200 = 900`
    - For the fifth sign (period 503): `(900 // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`
    - For the sixth sign (period 1006): `(1006 // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`
  - The output is `2012`, which matches the example.

Based on the analysis and verification, the program correctly computes the year in which the n-th sign will occur for each test case.
