Reasoning:
The given program logic does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program is supposed to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party, based on the condition that for a friend to attend, both they and their best friend must receive an invitation.

The current implementation checks if there exists a pair of friends (i.e., `i` and `p[i]`) who are each other's best friends. If such a pair is found, it prints `2` because sending invitations to this pair ensures that both friends will attend. However, if no such pair is found, it incorrectly prints `3`. This is not always correct because there could be other configurations where fewer than 3 invitations are sufficient to invite at least 2 friends.

For example, consider the test case:
```
4
2 3 4 1
```
The program would print `3` because it does not find a pair of friends who are each other's best friends. However, Monocarp can invite friends 1 and 2, and both will come to the party because friend 1's best friend is friend 2 and vice versa. Thus, only 2 invitations are needed.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all possible scenarios and does not always determine the minimum number of invitations required.

Correctness: **False**
