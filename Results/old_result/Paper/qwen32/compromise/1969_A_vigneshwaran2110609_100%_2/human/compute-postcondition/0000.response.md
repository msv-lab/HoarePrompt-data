The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50. Since the input operation changes the value of `n`, we will update it based on the input. However, the input value itself is not provided, so we will represent it as an integer `n` within the specified range.

The other variables `t` and `p` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `n` and the unchanged values of `t` and `p`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer read from input such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct.**
