Output State: **`x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is the total number of iterations, `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `flag` is `True`, and `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.
