Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer read from input such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    x = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    for i in range(0, x):
        if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
            flag = True
            print(2)
            break
    else:
        print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop completes all `x` iterations without breaking. The program prints `3`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `x`, `n` is the total number of iterations, `x` is the number of iterations, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `flag` is `False`, and `3` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: x is greater than 0, i is x (since the loop completes all iterations), n is the total number of iterations, l is a new list of integers obtained from the input, flag is False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
