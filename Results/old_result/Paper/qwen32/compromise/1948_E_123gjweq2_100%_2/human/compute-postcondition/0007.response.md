To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, let's analyze the loop step by step.

### Initial State Recap
- `left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr).
- `clique` is an integer representing the clique number.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`.
- `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`.
- `arr[left + mid - 1]` to `arr[left]` are set to values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`.
- `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are set to `clique`.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates `not_mid` times, which is `right - left + 1 - mid` times. During each iteration `i`:
- `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `big_element - i`.
- `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is set to `clique`.

### Output State Calculation
After the loop completes, the following changes occur:
- For indices from `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1`, `arr` will be filled with values from `big_element` down to `big_element - not_mid + 1`.
- For the same indices, `cliquess` will be filled with the value `clique`.

### Output State
The output state can be described as follows:
- The elements in `arr` from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` will be set to values from `big_element` down to `big_element - not_mid + 1`.
- The elements in `cliquess` from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` will be set to `clique`.
- All other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`) remain unchanged.

### Final Output State
Output State: **`arr[left + mid]` to `arr[left + mid + not_mid - 1]` are set to values from `big_element` down to `big_element - not_mid + 1`; `cliquess[left + mid]` to `cliquess[left + mid + not_mid - 1]` are set to `clique`; all other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`) remain unchanged.**
