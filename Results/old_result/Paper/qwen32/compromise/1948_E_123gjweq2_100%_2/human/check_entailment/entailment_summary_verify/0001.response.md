Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to assign distinct integers to vertices and then partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques based on the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).

### Program Analysis

#### Function `func_1(n, k)`

1. **Initialization**:
   - `cliques = ceil(n / k)`: This determines the number of cliques.
   - `arr = [0] * n` and `cliquess = [0] * n`: These arrays are initialized to store the assigned values and clique assignments for each vertex.

2. **Loop through Cliques**:
   - The loop iterates through each clique and calls `make_array` to populate `arr` and `cliquess`.

#### Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`

- This function is intended to fill `arr` and `cliquess` for a specific range of vertices.
- It calculates `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` to distribute values in a way that respects the condition.
- It assigns values to `arr` and clique numbers to `cliquess`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Global Variables**:
   - The `arr` and `cliquess` arrays are used in `make_array` but are defined in `func_1`. This will cause an `UnboundLocalError` unless `arr` and `cliquess` are declared as global or passed as parameters.

2. **Logic for Assigning Values**:
   - The logic in `make_array` is intended to distribute values in a way that respects the condition, but it is not clear whether this distribution guarantees the minimum number of cliques.
   - The distribution strategy should ensure that all pairs within a clique satisfy the condition and that the number of cliques is minimized.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases explicitly, such as when `k` is very small or very large.

### Function Summary

The function summary for `make_array` states that it modifies `arr` and `cliquess` by setting specific segments of `arr` to a sequence of increasing and decreasing values based on the `left` and `right` indices, and assigns the `clique` value to the corresponding segment in `cliquess`.

### Original Assessment

The original assessment correctly identifies the issues with global variables and the need for a clear distribution strategy to ensure the minimum number of cliques. The assessment concludes that the program is not guaranteed to be correct.

### Re-evaluation

Let's address the identified issues:

1. **Global Variables**:
   - To fix this, `arr` and `cliquess` should be passed as parameters to `make_array`.

2. **Logic for Assigning Values**:
   - The current logic in `make_array` may not guarantee the minimum number of cliques. A more systematic approach is needed to ensure that all pairs within a clique satisfy the condition and that the number of cliques is minimized.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should be tested with various edge cases to ensure correctness.

### Revised Code

Let's revise the code to address the global variable issue and improve the logic:

```python
from math import ceil

def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n

    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(arr, cliquess, i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
    
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

def make_array(arr, cliquess, left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique

# Example usage:
# func_1(2, 3)
# func_1(5, 4)
# func_1(8, 16)
```

### Conclusion

The original assessment is correct in identifying the issues with the program. The revised code addresses the global variable issue, but the logic for assigning values and ensuring the minimum number of cliques still needs further refinement. However, based on the given information and the identified issues, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
