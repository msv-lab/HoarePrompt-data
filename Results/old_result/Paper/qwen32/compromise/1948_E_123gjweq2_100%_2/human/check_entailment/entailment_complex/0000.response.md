### Reasoning:

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - The problem requires us to assign distinct integers to vertices and then connect pairs of vertices based on the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
   - The graph should then be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It calculates the number of cliques as the ceiling of \( \frac{n}{k} \).
   - It initializes two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, with zeros.
   - It calls `make_array` for each block of size `k` to populate `arr` and `cliquess`.

3. **Function `make_array`**:
   - It fills the segment of `arr` from `left` to `right` with a sequence of numbers that start from `left + 1` and increase up to `mid`, then decrease from `right + 1` down to `mid + 1`.
   - It assigns the same clique number to this segment in `cliquess`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function `func_1` prints the list `arr`, the number of cliques, and the list `cliquess`.

### Analysis:

- **Assigning Distinct Integers**:
  - `arr` is supposed to contain distinct integers from 1 to n. However, the way `make_array` fills `arr` does not guarantee that all elements in `arr` are distinct. For example, if `n = 5` and `k = 2`, the first call to `make_array` will fill the first two elements of `arr` with 1 and 2, and the second call will fill the next two elements with 3 and 4, but the fifth element will be filled with 5, which is correct. However, if `k` is larger, there is a risk of overwriting elements or not filling all elements with distinct values.
  
- **Graph Connectivity**:
  - The problem requires that for every pair of vertices (i, j), if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \), then an edge should exist between them.
  - The current implementation does not ensure that all such pairs are connected. The way `arr` is filled does not guarantee the connectivity condition.

- **Clique Partitioning**:
  - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques. The current implementation attempts to do this by grouping vertices into blocks of size `k` and assigning the same clique number to each block.
  - However, this does not guarantee that the resulting graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. It might create more cliques than necessary.

### Conclusion:

Given the above points, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem as described. The way `arr` is filled does not guarantee distinct integers, and the clique partitioning does not necessarily result in the minimum number of cliques.

**Correctness: False**
