Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find all possible values of `k` such that Vasya's position `n` and the number he received `x` match the described settling pattern. The pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions and follows a specific sequence of numbers.

### Key Observations
1. The pattern is symmetric and repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
2. For a position `n` and number `x` to be valid, `x` must be within the range `[1, k]` in the first half of the repeating cycle and within the range `[2, k - 1]` in the second half.
3. The position `n` can be expressed in terms of the cycle length `2k - 2` as `n = m*(2k - 2) + r` where `r` is the remainder and `1 <= r <= 2k - 2`.

### Program Analysis
The program attempts to find valid `k` values by:
1. Checking if `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)` are even.
2. Using a function `func_1` to find divisors of these even numbers.
3. Filtering these divisors to determine valid `k` values.

Let's break down the issues in the program:

1. **Condition Check**: The program checks if `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)` are even. This is correct because the cycle length `2k - 2` must be even.
2. **Finding Divisors**: The `func_1` function correctly finds divisors of a number, but it does not specifically check if these divisors correspond to valid `k` values.
3. **Filtering Divisors**: The program filters the divisors to check if `(s + 2) / 2` is an integer and if it is greater than or equal to `x`. However, it does not correctly handle the case where `r` (the remainder) is within the valid range of the pattern.

### Issues and Corrections
1. **Divisor Filtering**: The program does not correctly filter the divisors to ensure they correspond to valid `k` values. Specifically, it should check if the remainder `r` of `n` divided by `2k - 2` is within the valid range of the pattern.
2. **Output Handling**: The program does not print the output for each test case. It only calculates the possible `k` values but does not output them.

### Correctness
Given the issues identified, the program is not correct. It does not properly filter the divisors to ensure they correspond to valid `k` values and it does not output the results.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
