You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    output = list(set(output))

def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a list of all its divisors in ascending order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find all possible values of `k` such that Vasya's position `n` and the number he received `x` match the described settling pattern. The pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions and follows a specific sequence of numbers.

### Key Observations
1. The pattern is symmetric and repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
2. For a position `n` and number `x` to be valid, `x` must be within the range `[1, k]` in the first half of the repeating cycle and within the range `[2, k - 1]` in the second half.
3. The position `n` can be expressed in terms of the cycle length `2k - 2` as `n = m*(2k - 2) + r` where `r` is the remainder and `1 <= r <= 2k - 2`.

### Program Analysis
The program attempts to find valid `k` values by:
1. Checking if `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)` are even.
2. Using a function `func_1` to find divisors of these even numbers.
3. Filtering these divisors to determine valid `k` values.

Let's break down the issues in the program:

1. **Condition Check**: The program checks if `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)` are even. This is correct because the cycle length `2k - 2` must be even.
2. **Finding Divisors**: The `func_1` function correctly finds divisors of a number, but it does not specifically check if these divisors correspond to valid `k` values.
3. **Filtering Divisors**: The program filters the divisors to check if `(s + 2) / 2` is an integer and if it is greater than or equal to `x`. However, it does not correctly handle the case where `r` (the remainder) is within the valid range of the pattern.

### Issues and Corrections
1. **Divisor Filtering**: The program does not correctly filter the divisors to ensure they correspond to valid `k` values. Specifically, it should check if the remainder `r` of `n` divided by `2k - 2` is within the valid range of the pattern.
2. **Output Handling**: The program does not print the output for each test case. It only calculates the possible `k` values but does not output them.

### Correctness
Given the issues identified, the program is not correct. It does not properly filter the divisors to ensure they correspond to valid `k` values and it does not output the results.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
