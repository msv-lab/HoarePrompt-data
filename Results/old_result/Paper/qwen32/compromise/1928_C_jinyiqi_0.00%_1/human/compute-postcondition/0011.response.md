The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to the upper bound of the range, which is `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented again to reflect the start of the next iteration. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, so `i` is now `i + 1`. If `x % i == 0`, then `output1` has a new element appended, which is the current value of `i`, and `output2` has a new element appended, which is the integer value of `x / i`. Otherwise, `output1` and `output2` remain unchanged from the previous iteration.**

Since only `i` is in the loop head and needs to be adjusted, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `i` is `i + 1`**
