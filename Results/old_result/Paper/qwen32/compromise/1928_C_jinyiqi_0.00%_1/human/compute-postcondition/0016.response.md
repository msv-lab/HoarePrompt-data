The code `output1.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the list `output1`. This means that the first element becomes the last, the second element becomes the second to last, and so on. The list `output2` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, but in reverse order; `output2` contains the corresponding divisors greater than or equal to the square root of `x`.**
