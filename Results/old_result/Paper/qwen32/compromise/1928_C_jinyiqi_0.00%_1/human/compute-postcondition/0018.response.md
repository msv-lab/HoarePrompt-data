The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`, which is an integer. The function returns a list containing all divisors of `x` in ascending order. This list is formed by concatenating two sublists: `output2`, which contains the divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output1`, which contains the divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a list of all its divisors in ascending order.**
