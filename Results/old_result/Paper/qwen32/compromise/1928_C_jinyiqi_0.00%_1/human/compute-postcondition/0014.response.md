Postcondition: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `i` is `i + 1`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `output1` contains the value of `i` and `output2` contains the value of `int(x / i)` appended to it. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, then `output1` and `output2` remain unchanged.**
