The code appends the integer division of `x` by `i` to the list `output2`. The values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged, and `i` is already defined as `i + 1` in the initial state, so it remains `i + 1` after the execution.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `i` is `i + 1`; `output1` contains the value of `i`; `output2` contains the value of `int(x / i)` appended to it.**
