Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 â‰¤ x < n â‰¤ 10^9; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `output1` has a new element appended, which is the current value of `i`; `output2` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.**

In simple terms, `x` and `n` retain their original values, `i` has been increased by 1, `output1` now includes the new value of `i`, and `output2` remains the same as before.
