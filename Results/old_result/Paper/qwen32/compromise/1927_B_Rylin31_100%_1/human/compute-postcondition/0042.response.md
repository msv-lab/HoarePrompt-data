The code snippet `s[j] += 1` increments the value at index `j` in the list `s` by 1. Given that `s` is a list of `l` zeros except `s[j]` which is 1, after the operation, `s[j]` will be 2.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is 1, `l` is the new input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros except `s[j]` which is 2, `array` must have more than one element, `ans` is either `'aa'` or `'ab'`, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is the next element in `array`**

In natural language: The value at index `j` in the list `s` is now 2, while all other elements in `s` remain 0. The other variables (`t`, `l`, `array`, `ans`, `i`, and `j`) retain their initial values as specified.
