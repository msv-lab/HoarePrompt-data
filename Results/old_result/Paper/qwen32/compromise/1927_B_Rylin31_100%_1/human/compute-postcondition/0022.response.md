The code snippet provided is `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)`. Given the initial state, `s` is a list of `l` zeros, and `j` is not defined in the initial state but is implied to be an index used in the code snippet. Since `s` contains only zeros, `s[j]` will be 0 for any valid index `j`.

The `chr` function converts an integer to its corresponding ASCII character. Adding 97 to 0 gives 97, which corresponds to the character 'a'. Therefore, `ans` will have 'a' appended to it.

The variables `t`, `l`, `s`, `array`, and `i` are not modified by this line of code, so their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros, `array` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `ans` is 'a', `i` is `i + 1`**.
