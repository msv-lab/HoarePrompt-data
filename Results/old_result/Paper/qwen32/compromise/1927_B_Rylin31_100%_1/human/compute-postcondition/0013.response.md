The code `s[j] += 1` increments the element at index `j` in the list `s` by 1. Given the initial state, the element at index `j` in `s` was initially 2 (since it was incremented from 0 to 2). After the operation, the element at index `j` in `s` will be 3.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros with the element at index `j` incremented to 3, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is a string that has had 'a', 'b', and 'c' appended to it, `j` is the next element in `array`.**
