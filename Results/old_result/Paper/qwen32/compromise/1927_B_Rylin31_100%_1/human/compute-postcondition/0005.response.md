The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`, which iterates over the elements of `array`. To ensure that the loop can execute, the `array` must have at least one element. The other variables (`t`, `l`, `s`, and `ans`) are not directly related to the execution of the loop and do not need to be adjusted to make the loop execute.

To ensure the loop executes, `array` must contain at least one element. The state of `j` does not need to be specified before the loop starts because it will be assigned the first element of `array` during the first iteration.

State: **`t` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is an empty string**
