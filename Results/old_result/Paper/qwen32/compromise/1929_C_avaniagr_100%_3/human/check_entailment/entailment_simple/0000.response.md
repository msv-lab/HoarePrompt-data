### Reasoning:

The program provided seems to be attempting to determine if Sasha can guarantee to reach any number of coins `n` given the rules of the casino. The logic is based on the relationship between `k`, `x`, and `a`:

1. **Case 1: `x < k - 1`**
   - Sasha can only afford to lose `x` times in a row. If `x < k - 1`, then Sasha needs at least `x + 1` coins to start because he needs to be able to place bets of increasing amounts up to `x` consecutive losses before he can start winning again.
   - If `a >= x + 1`, Sasha can place bets in a way that he can eventually recover from any sequence of up to `x` losses and continue to increase his coins.

2. **Case 2: `x == k - 1`**
   - If `x == k - 1`, Sasha needs a bit more than in the previous case because he needs to cover the scenario where he loses `k - 1` times in a row and still be able to place a bet.
   - If `a >= x + 2`, Sasha can manage to recover from `k - 1` consecutive losses and continue to increase his coins.

3. **Case 3: `x > k - 1`**
   - If `x > k - 1`, Sasha can afford to lose more times than he needs to increase his bets. The program calculates a threshold `z` which represents the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to ensure he can recover from any sequence of losses and continue to increase his coins.
   - The calculation of `z` is done iteratively, adding the necessary coins for each additional loss beyond `k - 1`.
   - If `a >= z`, Sasha can guarantee to reach any number of coins.

The logic seems to be correctly addressing the problem constraints and conditions. The program iterates through each test case, applies the correct logic based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`, and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
