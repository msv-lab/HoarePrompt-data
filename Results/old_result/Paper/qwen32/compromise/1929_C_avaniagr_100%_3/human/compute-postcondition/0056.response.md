The `print('YES')` statement in the provided code snippet will output the string `'YES'`, regardless of the values of the variables `s`, `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`.

Here is the breakdown:
- The variable `s` is described as the next input string from the file.
- The variable `t` is mentioned to remain unchanged, but its value is not relevant to the `print` statement.
- The variables `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting the new `s`, but they are not used in the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement is explicitly printing the string `'YES'`, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
