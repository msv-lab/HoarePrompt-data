The value of `z` is calculated as `k - 2`. The values of `s`, `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the next input string from the file, `t` remains unchanged, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting the new `s`, and `z` is `k - 2`.

Output State: **`s` is the next input string from the file, `t` remains unchanged, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting the new `s`, `z` is `k - 2`.**
