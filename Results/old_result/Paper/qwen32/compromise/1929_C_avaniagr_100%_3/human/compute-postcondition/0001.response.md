The provided code snippet is reading a single line of input, splitting it into three parts, and then mapping those parts to integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. This line of code is typically used inside a loop that processes multiple test cases, where `s` is expected to be a string representing the input for a single test case.

Given the initial state, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are not specified, but we know the constraints on their values. After the execution of the code snippet, the variables `k`, `x`, and `a` will be assigned the integer values from the split string `s`.

Output State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers with values derived from the split string `s`, where `2 ≤ k ≤ 30`, `1 ≤ x ≤ 100`, and `1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9`. The number of test cases `t` and any other test cases remain unchanged.**
