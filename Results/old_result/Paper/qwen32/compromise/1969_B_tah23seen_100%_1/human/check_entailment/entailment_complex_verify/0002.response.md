### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution to ensure its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to sort a binary string in non-descending order (all '0's followed by all '1's) using cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted. The goal is to determine the minimum total cost required to achieve this.

#### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution defines a function `func_1(s)` that calculates the cost for a given binary string `s`.

Here's the logic of the function:
1. Initialize `cost` to 0, which will accumulate the total cost.
2. Initialize `one` to 0, which counts the number of '1's encountered so far.
3. Iterate through each character `i` in the string `s`:
   - If `i` is '1', increment the `one` counter.
   - If `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0 (indicating that there are '1's before this '0'), add `one + 1` to the `cost`. The `+1` accounts for the cost of shifting the substring that includes this '0' and all preceding '1's.

#### Correctness Check:

Let's verify if this logic correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the string.

- **Case 1:** If the string is already sorted (all '0's followed by all '1's), the function will return 0, which is correct because no operations are needed.
- **Case 2:** For a string like "11000", the function correctly calculates the cost as 9:
  - The first '0' encounters two '1's before it, so the cost is 2 + 1 = 3.
  - The second '0' encounters two '1's before it, so the cost is 2 + 1 = 3.
  - The third '0' encounters two '1's before it, so the cost is 2 + 1 = 3.
  - Total cost = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.
- **Case 3:** For a string like "10", the function correctly calculates the cost as 2:
  - The '0' encounters one '1' before it, so the cost is 1 + 1 = 2.

#### Validation Using Annotations:

The annotations provided state:
- `s` is unchanged.
- `cost` is the sum of (number of consecutive '1's + 1) for each sequence of '1's followed by a '0'.
- `one` is the count of consecutive '1's at the end of the string `s` (if any).

These annotations align with the logic of the function. The function iterates through the string, counting '1's and adding the cost whenever a '0' is encountered after some '1's.

#### Potential Issues:
However, we need to consider if there are any edge cases or scenarios that the function might not handle correctly. Let's consider the following:
- **Case 4:** For a string like "1111", the function will return 0 because there are no '0's to trigger the cost calculation. This is correct because no operations are needed to sort the string.
- **Case 5:** For a string like "0000", the function will return 0 because there are no '1's to trigger the cost calculation. This is correct because the string is already sorted.
- **Case 6:** For a string like "101011", the function calculates the cost as 5:
  - The first '0' encounters one '1' before it, so the cost is 1 + 1 = 2.
  - The second '0' encounters two '1's before it, so the cost is 2 + 1 = 3.
  - Total cost = 2 + 3 = 5.
- **Case 7:** For a string like "01101001", the function calculates the cost as 11:
  - The first '0' encounters one '1' before it, so the cost is 1 + 1 = 2.
  - The second '0' encounters two '1's before it, so the cost is 2 + 1 = 3.
  - The third '0' encounters two '1's before it, so the cost is 2 + 1 = 3.
  - The fourth '0' encounters one '1' before it, so the cost is 1 + 1 = 2.
  - Total cost = 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 10. This does not match the expected output of 11.

The function seems to correctly handle most cases, but the example "01101001" indicates a potential issue. The function might not correctly account for all necessary shifts in this case.

### Conclusion:

The function `func_1(s)` appears to have a logical flaw that results in incorrect cost calculations for certain strings. Specifically, the function does not account for all necessary shifts in some scenarios, as seen in the example "01101001".

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
