To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which is `i` and the range `max(len_a, len_b)`. 

The loop will execute if `max(len_a, len_b)` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that either `len_a` or `len_b` is at least 1 so that the loop can execute. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `d`, `count_a`, and `count_b` do not directly affect whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted for the purpose of this task.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` - 1 < 10^4; `n`, `m`, `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input; `len_a` is the length of the list `a` and must be at least 1 or `len_b` is the length of the new list `b` and must be at least 1; `d` is `k // 2`; `count_a` is 0; `count_b` is 0**
