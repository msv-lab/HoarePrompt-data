Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts integers `n` and `m`, an even integer `k`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a list `b` of `m` integers. It returns a value based on these inputs, with specific conditions for each test case.**
