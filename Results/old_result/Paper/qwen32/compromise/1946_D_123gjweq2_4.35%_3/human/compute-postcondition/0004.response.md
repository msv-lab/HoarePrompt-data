The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `xor`. The other variables (`cur_arr`, `bit`, and `new_arr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30, `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 0.**
