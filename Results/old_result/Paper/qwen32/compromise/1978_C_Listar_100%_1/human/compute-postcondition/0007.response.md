Output State: **The program returns None.**

Explanation: The provided code snippet ends with a `return` statement without any specified value, which means it returns `None`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `l` are not used in the return statement, and `func_5(l)` has already been executed, but its result is not stored or returned. Therefore, the output is `None`.
