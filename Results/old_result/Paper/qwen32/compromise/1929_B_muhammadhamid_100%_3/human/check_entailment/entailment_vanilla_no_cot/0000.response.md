Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to ensure that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell. Let's analyze the problem and the program:

### Problem Analysis
The diagonals in an `n x n` grid can be divided into two categories:
1. **Main Diagonals**: These are the diagonals that run from the top-left to the bottom-right and from the top-right to the bottom-left. There are exactly `2n - 1` diagonals in each category.
2. **Secondary Diagonals**: These are the diagonals that are parallel to the main diagonals but do not include the corners of the grid.

For a given `n`, there are `2n - 1` diagonals in each direction, giving a total of `4n - 2` diagonals.

### Key Observations:
- If `k <= n`, we can color `k` cells on the main diagonal (either top-left to bottom-right or top-right to bottom-left) to cover `k` diagonals.
- If `k > n`, we need to color cells in such a way that we cover as many diagonals as possible with the minimum number of cells. The optimal strategy is to color cells in a "zigzag" pattern that covers multiple diagonals with each cell.

### Correct Solution Approach
1. **For `k <= n`**: The minimum number of cells to color is `k` because we can just color `k` cells on one of the main diagonals.
2. **For `k > n`**: We need to use a more efficient strategy. The optimal strategy is to color cells in a zigzag pattern that covers multiple diagonals. Specifically, we can color cells in a pattern that covers `2 * (n - 1)` diagonals with `n - 1` cells, and then add additional cells as needed to cover the remaining diagonals.

### Correct Implementation
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k <= n:
            print(k)
        else:
            # We need to cover more than n diagonals
            # First, we cover 2 * (n - 1) diagonals with n - 1 cells
            # Then we need to cover the remaining diagonals
            remaining_diagonals = k - (2 * (n - 1))
            # Each additional cell can cover at most 2 diagonals
            additional_cells = math.ceil(remaining_diagonals / 2)
            total_cells = (n - 1) + additional_cells
            print(total_cells)

func()
```

### Conclusion
The original program does not handle the case where `k > n` correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.
