Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to decode the string `b` by reversing the encoding process described in the problem statement. However, there is a mistake in the implementation of the `func_1` function. The function incorrectly generates a mapping from characters in `b` to characters from 'z' to 'a' based on the length of `b`, which is incorrect. The correct mapping should be based on the length of the auxiliary string `r` (the string of unique characters in `b` sorted in alphabetical order), not the length of `b` itself.

The correct approach should be:
1. Create the auxiliary string `r` by taking the unique characters from `b` and sorting them.
2. Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the character at the mirrored position in `r`).
3. Use this mapping to decode the string `b`.

The provided code does not follow this correct approach, leading to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
