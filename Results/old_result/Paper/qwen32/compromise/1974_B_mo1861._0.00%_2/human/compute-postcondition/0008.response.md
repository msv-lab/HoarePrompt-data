Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It returns a new string `s` where each character in `b` is replaced by its corresponding character from `char_map`. The `char_map` maps unique characters in `b` to characters from 'z' to 'a' in descending order based on the sorted order of the unique characters in `b`.**
