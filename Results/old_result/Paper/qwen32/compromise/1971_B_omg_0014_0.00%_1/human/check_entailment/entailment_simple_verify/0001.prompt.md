You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():

            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program against the problem statement step-by-step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Input**:
   - There are `t` test cases.
   - Each test case contains a string `s` of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.

2. **Output**:
   - For each test case, we should output "YES" and a rearranged string `r` that is not equal to `s`, or "NO" if no such rearrangement exists.

3. **Logic**:
   - If the string `s` can be rearranged to form a string `r` that is not equal to `s`, output "YES" and one such rearrangement.
   - If no such rearrangement is possible, output "NO".

### Program Analysis
Here's the given program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
```

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the string `s`.

2. **Checking for Rearrangement Possibility**:
   - If the length of the set of characters in `s` is 2, it means that `s` consists of only two distinct characters. In such a case, it is impossible to rearrange `s` to form a string `r` that is not equal to `s` (since any rearrangement will still result in the same two characters alternating or grouped together). Hence, the program correctly outputs "NO" in this case.
   - If the length of the set of characters in `s` is more than 2, it means that `s` has at least three distinct characters, and thus, it is possible to rearrange `s` to form a string `r` that is not equal to `s`.

3. **Generating a Rearranged String**:
   - The program generates two possible rearrangements of `s`: one in ascending order (`b`) and one in descending order (`c`).
   - If the string `s` is already in ascending order (`b == s`), it outputs the string in descending order (`c`).
   - Otherwise, it outputs the string in ascending order (`b`).

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles the cases where rearrangement is not possible (when the string consists of only two distinct characters) and correctly generates a rearranged string when possible.

Thus, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
