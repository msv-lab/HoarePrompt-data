The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variables `t` and `s` are not part of the loop head and do not affect whether the loop will execute.

So, to ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0. The initial value of `i` before the loop starts does not matter as it is set by the `range` function in the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than 0**
