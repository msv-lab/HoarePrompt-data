You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 1
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of three integers k, x, and a, where 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 1
        
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')
        
    #State: Yes, No, Yes
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. For each test case, it calculates a value `s` based on the given `k` and `x`, and then prints "Yes" if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, otherwise it prints "No".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem revolves around Sasha's ability to guarantee that he can reach any number of coins `n` by placing bets in the casino under specific rules. The key points are:
- Sasha can win or lose a bet.
- Winning a bet multiplies the bet amount by `k`.
- Losing a bet means losing the bet amount.
- There is a limit `x` on consecutive losses.
- Sasha starts with `a` coins.

The goal is to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins `n` given these constraints.

### Strategy for Winning

To guarantee that Sasha can reach any number of coins `n`, he needs to be able to repeatedly increase his wealth and recover from losses without hitting the maximum consecutive loss limit `x`.

The strategy involves placing bets in a way that maximizes gains and minimizes the risk of hitting the loss limit. The program provided seems to be trying to simulate or calculate the minimum number of coins `s` Sasha needs to start with to ensure he can always recover from `x` consecutive losses and continue increasing his wealth.

### Program Analysis

The provided program calculates a value `s` which represents the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to start with to ensure he can handle `x` consecutive losses and still continue increasing his wealth. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: `s` is initialized to 1.
2. **Loop for Consecutive Losses**: The loop runs `x` times, and in each iteration, it updates `s` using the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`.
   - This formula seems to be an attempt to simulate the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to have after each consecutive loss to ensure he can still place a bet and recover.
3. **Comparison**: After the loop, the program checks if `a` (initial coins) is greater than or equal to `s`. If so, it prints "YES", indicating Sasha can achieve any number of coins; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness of the Program

The program's logic appears to be based on the idea that Sasha needs to have enough coins to recover from the maximum number of consecutive losses (`x`) and still be able to place bets to increase his wealth. However, the formula used to calculate `s` might not accurately reflect the required minimum number of coins to guarantee reaching any `n`.

The formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` is somewhat intuitive, but it doesn't fully account for the exponential growth of coins needed to handle multiple consecutive losses and ensure continuous wealth increase. The program might be oversimplifying the problem, leading to incorrect results for some test cases.

### Conclusion

Given the complexity of the problem and the need to accurately simulate or calculate the minimum starting amount `s`, the provided program might not be completely correct for all test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
