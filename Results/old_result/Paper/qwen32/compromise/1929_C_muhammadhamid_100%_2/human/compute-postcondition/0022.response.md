The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. The loop will execute based on the range generated by `int(input())`. Since the underscore is not used in the loop body, we don't need to adjust its state. Instead, we need to consider the state of the input that determines the range.

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration is `11`, this likely means that the loop has already executed 11 times. For the loop to execute one more time, the range must be such that it allows for 12 iterations.

Therefore, the input to `int(input())` must be 12.

State: **11 (previous iterations), input must be 12 for the next iteration**.

However, since we are only adjusting the state of objects in the loop head and the loop head does not contain any variables that we can directly modify, the state we need to convey is simply the requirement for the input.

State: **input must be 12**
