Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. `n` is an input integer.**

The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int()` converts it to an integer. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
