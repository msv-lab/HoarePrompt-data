Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string, and the character at position `j + 1` in `a` is not equal to the character at position `j` in `b`. Additionally, either the character at position `j + 1` in `a` is not '0' or the character at position `j` in `b` is not '1', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms, the values of `a`, `j`, and `b` remain unchanged, but the loop or if statement is exited.
