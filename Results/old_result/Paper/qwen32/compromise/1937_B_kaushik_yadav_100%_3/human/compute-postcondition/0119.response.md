The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` was `len(a) - 2`, it now becomes `len(a) - 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `i` is `len(a) - 1` or the loop breaks early, `work` is `False`, `counter` is the final value after all iterations, `ans` is the previous `ans` concatenated with `b[i]`.**
