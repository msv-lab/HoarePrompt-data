Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty stripped input string, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `i` is either 0 or 1, `work` is True, and if `i` is 0, `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the first character of `b` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; if `i` is 1, `ans` remains the first character of `a`, and `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` with `b[i]` not less than `a[i + 1]`.**
