The code snippet provided is `ans += a[i]`. This line appends the character at index `i` of the string `a` to the string `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a non-empty string
- `b` is the newly stripped input string
- `i` is `len(a) - 2`
- `work` is `False`
- `j` is `len(a) - 2` or the loop breaks early
- `counter` is the final value after all iterations
- `ans` is the first character of `a` if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `work` is `False` with `b[i] < a[i + 1]`; otherwise, `ans` is the first character of `b` concatenated with `a[i]`. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `ans` is the first character of `b` concatenated with `a[i]` and then concatenated with `b[i]`. If `work` is `False` and `i` is incremented, `ans` is the previous `ans` concatenated with `b[i]`.

After the execution of `ans += a[i]`, the value of `ans` will be updated by appending `a[i]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `work` is `False`, `j` is `len(a) - 2` or the loop breaks early, `counter` is the final value after all iterations, `ans` is the previous `ans` concatenated with `a[i]`.**
