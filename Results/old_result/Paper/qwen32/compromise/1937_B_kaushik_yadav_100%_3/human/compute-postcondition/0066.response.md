Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a stripped input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `ans` is the final constructed string based on the alternating characters from `a` and `b`, `i` is at least 2, `work` is False, `j` is 3. If `a[j + 1]` equals `b[j]`, then `counter` is incremented by 1. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', then `counter` is set to 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
