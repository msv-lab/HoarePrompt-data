The `counter` variable is defined as `len(a) + 1`. To determine the value printed by the `print(counter)` statement, we need to understand what `len(a)` represents.

`len(a)` is the length of the list `a`, which is the number of elements in the list. Therefore, `counter` will be the length of the list `a` plus one.

Since the exact contents of the list `a` are not provided, we cannot determine the numerical value of `len(a)`, but we can express the value of `counter` in terms of `len(a)`.

The value of `counter` is `len(a) + 1`.

Output: **len(a) + 1 (where len(a) is the number of elements in the list `a`)**
