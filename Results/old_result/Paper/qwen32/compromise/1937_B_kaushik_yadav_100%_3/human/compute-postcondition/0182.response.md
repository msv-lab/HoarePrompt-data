Postcondition: **`j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the final count based on the loop conditions, `t` is at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is either `len(a) - 2` or `len(a) - 1`, `work` is either True or False. If `work` is True, `ans` includes the second-to-last character of `a`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False. If `i` is `len(a) - 2` and `work` is True, `ans` also includes the character at index `i` of `b`. If `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` includes the character `b[i]` appended to its previous value.**
