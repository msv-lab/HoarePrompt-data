Postcondition: **`j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the final count based on the loop conditions, `t` is at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is the first character of `a`, `i` is 0, `work` is True, and either `i + 1` is not less than `len(a)` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`**
