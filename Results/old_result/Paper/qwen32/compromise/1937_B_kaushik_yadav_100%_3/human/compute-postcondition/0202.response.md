The value of `counter` is updated to 1. The values of `a`, `j`, `a[j + 1]`, and `b[j]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `counter` is 1, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `a[j + 1]` is '0', `b[j]` is '1', and `a[j + 1]` is not equal to `b[j]`.

Output State: **`counter` is 1, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `a[j + 1]` is '0', `b[j]` is '1', and `a[j + 1]` is not equal to `b[j]`.**
