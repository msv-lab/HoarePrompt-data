Postcondition: **`counter` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `j` is 2. If `a[j + 1] == b[j]`, then `counter` is either 2, 3, 4, or 5. Otherwise, if `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'`, `counter` is set to 1. In all other cases, `counter` retains its original value.**
