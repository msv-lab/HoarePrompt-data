### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the provided code and its behavior to determine if it meets the problem requirements.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - The function starts with an empty list `array = []`.
    - It processes each operation in the `operations` list.
        - If the operation type `op_type` is 1, it appends the `value` to the `array`.
        - If the operation type `op_type` is 2, it duplicates the array by extending it with itself. However, the provided code does not actually duplicate the array `x` times; it just duplicates it once. This is a critical mistake because the problem statement specifies that the array should be extended by `x` copies of itself.
    - After processing all operations, it processes each query `k` by finding the element at the `(k - 1) % len(array)` position in the final array and appends it to the `result` list.
    - Finally, it returns the `result` list.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
    - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`.
    - It then reads the operations and queries for the test case.
    - It calls `func_1` with these inputs and prints the results.

### Issues Identified:
- The primary issue with `func_1` is that it does not correctly handle the second type of operation (operation type 2). Instead of duplicating the array `x` times, it only duplicates it once. This is a significant deviation from the problem requirements.
- Given the incorrect handling of the second type of operation, the final array `array` will not be correctly constructed, leading to incorrect results for the queries.

### Conclusion:
Since `func_1` does not correctly handle the operations as described in the problem statement, the overall program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
