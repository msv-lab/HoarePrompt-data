### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the solution to the problem described.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty list `array` to store the elements and another list `result` to store the answers to the queries.
    - **Processing Operations**:
        - For each operation, if the operation type `op_type` is 1, it appends the value `x` to the `array`.
        - If `op_type` is 2, it appends `x` copies of the current `array` to the end of `array`. This is done using a list comprehension that iterates over the current length of `array` and extends `array` with these elements.
    - **Processing Queries**:
        - For each query `k`, it calculates the index `(k - 1) % len(array)` to determine the element at that position in the `array` and appends it to the `result` list.
    - **Return**: The function returns the `result` list, which contains the answers to the queries.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
    - **Input Handling**:
        - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
        - For each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`.
        - It reads the `n` operations and stores them in a list `operations`.
        - It reads the `q` queries and stores them in a list `queries`.
    - **Processing**:
        - It calls `func_1` with the number of operations, the list of operations, and the list of queries to get the `result` for that test case.
        - It prints the `result` for each test case.

### Issues and Correction:
- **Issue in Operation Type 2**: The current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly handle the second type of operation. When `op_type` is 2, the code attempts to extend the array with `x` copies of itself by using a list comprehension that iterates over the current length of the array and appends each element `x` times. This is incorrect because it should extend the array with the entire current array `x` times, not just each element `x` times.
- **Correct Implementation for Operation Type 2**: Instead of using a list comprehension to extend the array with each element `x` times, the code should extend the array with the entire array `x` times. This can be done using `array.extend(array * x)`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend(array * value)  # Corrected line
        
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
        
    return result

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        
        print(*result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()
```

### Conclusion:
The original implementation of `func_1` is incorrect due to the incorrect handling of the second type of operation. The corrected implementation is provided above. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
