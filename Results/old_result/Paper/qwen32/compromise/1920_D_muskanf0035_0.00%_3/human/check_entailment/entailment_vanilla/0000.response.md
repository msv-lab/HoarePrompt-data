Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Operations:**
   - Type 1: Append an integer `x` to the array.
   - Type 2: Append `x` copies of the current array to itself.
   
2. **Queries:**
   - For each query, return the `k`-th element of the final array.

### Key Points:
- The array can grow exponentially with Type 2 operations.
- Directly constructing the array as described is infeasible due to the potential size of the array (up to \(10^{18}\)).
- Instead, the solution should focus on tracking the structure of the array without fully constructing it.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by directly constructing the array with operations and then answering queries based on the constructed array.

#### Function `func_1`:
- It initializes an empty list `array`.
- For each operation, it either appends an integer (`op_type == 1`) or extends the array by appending `x` copies of itself (`op_type == 2`).
- After processing all operations, it answers each query by finding the element at the `(k - 1) % len(array)` index.

#### Function `func_2`:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, the operations, and the queries.
- It calls `func_1` to process the operations and answer the queries.
- It prints the results for each query.

### Issues:
1. **Exponential Growth:** The program attempts to directly construct the array, which can lead to extremely large arrays (up to \(10^{18}\) elements) and will cause memory and time issues.
2. **Incorrect Implementation of Type 2 Operation:** The line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` does not correctly implement the operation of appending `x` copies of the array to itself. Instead, it appends the current array twice, not `x` times.

### Correct Approach:
- Instead of constructing the array, keep track of segments and their sizes.
- Use a segment tree or similar structure to efficiently answer queries without constructing the full array.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to its attempt to directly construct the array, which is infeasible given the problem constraints, and due to the incorrect implementation of the Type 2 operation.

**Correctness: False**
