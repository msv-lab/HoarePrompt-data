Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Operations**:
   - **Type 1**: Append an integer `x` to the array.
   - **Type 2**: Append `x` copies of the current array to itself.

2. **Queries**:
   - For each query `k`, return the `k`-th element of the final array.

### Issues in the Provided Program:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Operation Type 2**:
   - The current implementation of operation type 2 in `func_1` is incorrect. Instead of appending `x` copies of the current array, it appends the current array to itself exactly once.
   - The correct implementation should extend the array by repeating it `x` times.

2. **Complexity Concerns**:
   - The provided implementation does not consider the constraints efficiently. Specifically, appending `x` copies of the array (where `x` can be up to \(10^9\)) would result in a very large array, which is impractical to handle within the given constraints.

3. **Modulo Operation for Queries**:
   - The modulo operation `(k - 1) % len(array)` is used to handle queries, which is correct if the array is not excessively large. However, given the large potential size of the array due to operation type 2, we need to ensure that we do not actually construct the full array.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Track Array Lengths**:
   - Instead of constructing the full array, keep track of the length of the array after each operation.
   - Use a stack to manage the lengths of the array as operations are performed.

2. **Binary Search for Queries**:
   - For each query, use binary search to determine which segment of the array the queried position corresponds to, based on the lengths tracked.

### Correctness of the Given Program:
Given the issues mentioned above, the provided program does not correctly implement the required operations and is therefore incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
