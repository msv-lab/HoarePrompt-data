Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of operations; `operations`, which is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `b` (either 1 or 2) and an integer `x` (with constraints based on the value of `b`); and `queries`, which is a list of integers representing indices. The function performs a series of operations on an initially empty array and returns a list `result` containing elements from the array at positions specified by the `queries`.**
