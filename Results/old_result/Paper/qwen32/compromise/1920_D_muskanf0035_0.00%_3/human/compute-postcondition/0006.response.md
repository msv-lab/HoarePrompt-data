Output State: **The program returns `result` which contains elements from `array` at positions determined by the indices calculated from `queries`.**

In simpler terms, the program returns a list called `result` that has elements from the list `array` at specific positions indicated by the `queries`. The values of `n`, `operations`, `queries`, and `array` remain unchanged and do not affect the returned `result`.
