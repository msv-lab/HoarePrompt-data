To verify the correctness of the given program, let's carefully analyze the problem requirements and the provided code, especially focusing on the dynamic programming approach used to calculate the number of final configurations.

### Problem Recap

1. **Game Mechanics**:
   - Players take turns placing rooks on an `n x n` chessboard.
   - The player places white rooks, and the computer places black rooks at mirrored positions `(c, r)` unless `r == c`.
   - If `r == c`, the computer skips its turn.
   
2. **Objective**:
   - Determine the number of different final configurations possible after `k` initial moves and subsequent valid moves until no more valid moves remain.

3. **Constraints**:
   - `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4` (number of test cases)
   - `1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5` (size of the chessboard)
   - `0 ≤ k ≤ n` (number of initial moves)
   - The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed `3 × 10^5`.

### Code Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads `k` pairs of integers representing the initial moves.

2. **Counting Self-Placing and Mirrored Rooks**:
   - For each move `(r, c)`, if `r == c`, it increments `num` by 1.
   - Otherwise, it increments `num` by 2.
   - `num` effectively counts the number of rooks placed after `k` moves, considering self-placing and mirrored pairs.

3. **Remaining Slots (`m`)**:
   - `m = n - num` represents the number of rows (or columns) that still need to be filled with rooks.

4. **Base Cases**:
   - If `m == 0`, there are no remaining slots, so the number of configurations is `0`.
   - If `m == 1`, there is only one slot left, so the number of configurations is `1`.

5. **Dynamic Programming Array (`dp`)**:
   - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to fill `i` remaining slots.
   - Initialization:
     - `dp[1] = 1`: One way to fill one slot.
     - `dp[2] = 3`: Three ways to fill two slots (two self-placing rooks or two mirrored pairs).
   - Transition:
     - For `i ≥ 3`, the formula used is:
       \[
       dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7)
       \]
     - This formula considers placing a self-placing rook in one of the `i` slots and then filling the remaining `i-1` slots, or placing a mirrored pair in two of the `i` slots and then filling the remaining `i-2` slots.

### Verification of Dynamic Programming Formula

The DP transition formula needs to accurately represent the ways to fill the remaining slots. Let's break it down:

- **Placing a Self-Placing Rook**:
  - Choose one of the `i` slots to place a self-placing rook.
  - The remaining `i-1` slots can be filled in `dp[i-1]` ways.
  
- **Placing a Mirrored Pair**:
  - Choose two of the `i` slots to place a mirrored pair.
  - There are \(\binom{i}{2} = \frac{i(i-1)}{2}\) ways to choose these two slots.
  - The remaining `i-2` slots can be filled in `dp[i-2]` ways.
  - Since each mirrored pair can be placed in two different orders, multiply by 2.

Thus, the formula:
\[
dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2
\]
correctly accounts for both scenarios.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of unique configurations based on the remaining slots after accounting for the initial moves. The dynamic programming approach ensures that all possible configurations are considered, and the modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
