To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which is `for i in range(3, m + 1):`. The loop will execute if the range `(3, m + 1)` contains at least one integer value. This means `m + 1` must be greater than 3, or equivalently, `m` must be greater than 2.

Let's analyze the given conditions:

- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (This variable is not directly related to the loop condition).
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 (This variable is used to calculate `m`).
- `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n (This variable is used to calculate `num`).
- `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the equality of `c` and `r` over `k` iterations (This variable is used to calculate `m`).
- `m` is `n - num` (This variable determines the range of the loop).
- `m` is not equal to 0, and `m` is not equal to 1 (These constraints need to be satisfied).
- `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3 (This list is not directly related to the loop condition).

For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 2. Given the constraints that `m` is not equal to 0 and not equal to 1, the smallest possible value for `m` is 3. Therefore, `m` must be at least 3.

Since `m = n - num`, and `m` must be at least 3, `n - num` must be at least 3. This implies that `num` must be less than or equal to `n - 3`.

Given the above analysis, the state needs to be adjusted such that `m` is at least 3, which means `n - num` should be at least 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the equality of `c` and `r` over `k` iterations and `num` must be less than or equal to `n - 3`, `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be greater than 2, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3**
