The code snippet creates a list `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all initialized to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, or `num`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for these variables, with the addition of the newly created list `dp`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `m` is `n - num`; `num` is the sum of `k` increments, each being either 1 or 2`; `m` is not equal to 0 and `m` is not equal to 1; `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros.**
