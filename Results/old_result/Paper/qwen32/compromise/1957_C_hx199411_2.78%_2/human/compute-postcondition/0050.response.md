The code snippet `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `num` is 1, `m` is `n`, `c` equals `r`, which is the second integer from the new input.**
