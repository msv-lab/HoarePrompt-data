Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is at least 1, `num` is 1, `m` is 0 or 1 or any other value (if `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of 6 zeros except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, and `dp[5]` which is 81), `c` is the first integer from the new input, `r` is the second integer from the new input, and `c` is equal to `r`.**

Explanation: The value of `num` is incremented by 1, so if it was initially 0, it now becomes 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
