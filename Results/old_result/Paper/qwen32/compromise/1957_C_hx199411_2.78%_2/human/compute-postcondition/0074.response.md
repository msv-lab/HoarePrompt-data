The code snippet sets the value of `dp[2]` to 3. This affects only the `dp` list, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `m` is `n - num`; `num` is the sum of `k` increments, each being either 1 or 2`; `m` is not equal to 0 and `m` is not equal to 1; `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3.**
