To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the variables evolve through each iteration and how the loop terminates.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t`: Number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- For each test case:
  - `n`: Size of the board (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5).
  - `k`: Number of moves (0 ≤ k ≤ n).
  - `r_i` and `c_i`: Coordinates of the moves (1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n).

### Loop Execution:
The loop runs `t` times, decrementing `t` by 1 in each iteration. For each test case:
- Read `n` and `k`.
- Initialize `num` to 0.
- For each of the `k` moves, increment `num` by 1 if `r_i == c_i` and by 2 otherwise.
- Compute `m` as `n - num`.
- Depending on the value of `m`:
  - If `m == 0` or `m == 1`, print `m`.
  - Otherwise, compute `dp[m]` using dynamic programming and print `dp[m]`.

### Given Output States:
- **After 1st iteration**: `t` is decremented, `n` and `k` are read, `num` is computed, `m` is computed, and the appropriate value is printed.
- **After 2nd iteration**: Similar to the first, but with new values of `n` and `k`, and a specific example of `dp` values for `m >= 5`.
- **After 3rd iteration**: Again, similar to the previous iterations, with new values of `n` and `k`, and a specific example of `dp` values for `m >= 5`.

### Final Output State:
The loop will continue until `t` becomes 0. After all iterations, `t` will be 0, and no more test cases will be processed. The state of the variables at the end of the loop will be:

- `t` will be 0.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `num`, `m`, `dp`) will reflect the state of the last test case processed.

Since the problem asks for the final output state after all iterations, we focus on the state of `t`:

**Output State: t is 0.**

This means that after all test cases have been processed, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that there are no more test cases left to process.
