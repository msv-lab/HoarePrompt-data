The code snippet sets `num` to 0, which overrides its previous definition as the sum of `k` increments, each being either 1 or 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `num` is 0. If `m` is 0, then `m` remains 0. Otherwise, if `m` is 1, `m` remains 1. For any other value of `m`, `m` is set to 5 and `dp` is a list of 6 zeros except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, and `dp[5]` which is 81.**
