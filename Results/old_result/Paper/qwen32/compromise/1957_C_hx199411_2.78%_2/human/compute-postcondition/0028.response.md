Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
- `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq n\).
- `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the equality of `c` and `r` over `k` iterations.
- `m` is `n - num`, and the current value of `m` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the integer `1`. This does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, or `m` mentioned in the initial state. The value to be printed is explicitly given as `1`.

### Output:
Based on the analysis, the output of the `print` statement is simply the number `1`.

Output: **1**
