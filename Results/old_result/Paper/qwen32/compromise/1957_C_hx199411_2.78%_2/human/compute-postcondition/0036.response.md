The given code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` based on the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m` remain unchanged. The only change is in the value of `dp[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the equality of `c` and `r` over `k` iterations and `num` must be less than or equal to `n - 3`, `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be greater than 2, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`**

In natural language: The value of `dp[i]` has been updated according to the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`, and the other elements of `dp`) remain unchanged.
