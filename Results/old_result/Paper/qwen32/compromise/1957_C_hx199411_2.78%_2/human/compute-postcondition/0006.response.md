The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` must be greater than 0, `num` is 0, `c` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input.**
