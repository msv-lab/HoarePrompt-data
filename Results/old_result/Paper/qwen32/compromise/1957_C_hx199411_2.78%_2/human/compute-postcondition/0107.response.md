Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the number of iterations from the input, `m` is `n - num`, `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`.**

In this output state, the value of `m` has been updated to be the difference between `n` and `num`. All other variables retain their initial conditions or definitions as described.
