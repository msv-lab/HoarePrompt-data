The code snippet sets `num` to 0. This affects the value of `num` but does not affect the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `dp[m]`). Since `num` is reset to 0, `m` will be recalculated as `n - num`, which simplifies to just `n`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `num` is 0; `m` is `n`; If `m` is 0, no further action is taken. If `m` is 1, no further action is taken. Otherwise, `dp[m]` is the final value computed by the loop, where `m` is greater than 2.**
