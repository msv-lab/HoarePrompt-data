To determine the new value of `dp[i]` after executing the given line of code, we'll use the provided initial state and the formula:

```
dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

Given:
- `i` is 5
- `dp[1]` is 1
- `dp[2]` is 3
- `dp[3]` is 7
- `dp[4]` is 25

We need to compute `dp[5]` using the formula.

Substitute `i = 5` into the formula:
```
dp[5] = (dp[4] + (5 - 1) * dp[3] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

Calculate the individual components:
- `dp[4]` is 25
- `(5 - 1)` is 4
- `dp[3]` is 7
- `4 * 7 * 2` is 56

So,
```
dp[5] = (25 + 56) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
dp[5] = 81 % (10 ** 9 + 7)
dp[5] = 81
```

Thus, `dp[5]` is updated to 81.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the number of iterations from the input, `m` is at least 5, `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, and `dp[5]` which is 81, `i` is 5**.
