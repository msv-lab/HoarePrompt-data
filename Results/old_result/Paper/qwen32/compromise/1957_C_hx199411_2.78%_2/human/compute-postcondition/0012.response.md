To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `c` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2.
- The loop is defined as `for i in range(k):`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken some value, and since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

The variable `k` does not change within the loop; it defines the upper limit of the range for `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this increment in `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `c` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1`.

So the final state would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `c` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2, `i` is `i + 1`**

However, to provide a more concrete example, if `i` was 0 at the start of the first iteration, then at the start of the second iteration, `i` would be 1. So if we assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `x + 1`.

Let's assume `i` was 0 at the start of the first iteration, so at the start of the second iteration, `i` would be 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `c` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2, `i` is 1**.

If `i` was 1 at the end of the first iteration, then at the start of the second iteration, `i` would be 2, and so on.

For the sake of providing a general answer without assuming specific values:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `c` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2, `i` is `i + 1`**
