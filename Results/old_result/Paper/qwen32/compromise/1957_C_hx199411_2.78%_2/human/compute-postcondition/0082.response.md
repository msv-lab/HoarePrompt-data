Let's break down the given initial state and analyze the variables involved:

- `t` is defined as `t - 1`, but since there is no initial value for `t` provided, this doesn't affect the current context directly.
- `n` is defined such that `n - num` is at least 3, but the exact value of `n` or `num` is not necessary to determine the output of the print statement.
- `k` is the second integer from the input, but it does not directly influence the value of `dp[m]`.
- `num` is the sum of `k` increments, each being either 1 or 2, but again, this does not affect the value of `dp[m]`.
- `m` is explicitly set to 5.
- `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros, with specific values assigned to `dp[1]`, `dp[2]`, `dp[3]`, `dp[4]`, and `dp[5]`.

Given these details, the `dp` list is initialized as follows:
```python
dp = [0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81]
```

The print statement is:
```python
print(dp[m])
```

Since `m` is 5, `dp[m]` translates to `dp[5]`. From the initialization of `dp`, we know that `dp[5]` is 81.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **81**
