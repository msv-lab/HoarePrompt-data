To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `k` is greater than 0.
- `c` is the first integer from the input.
- `r` is the second integer from the input.
- If `c` equals `r`, `num` is 2; otherwise, `num` is 3.
- `i` is incremented by 1 if `c` does not equal `r`.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(k):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` was incremented by 1 if `c` did not equal `r`.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `k`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 (since it was incremented at the end of the previous iteration).
- `k` remains unchanged.

So, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `c` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since `i` was incremented at the end of the previous iteration, we need to reflect that increment in the state description for the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `c` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input, `i` is `i + 1`**.

To make it more precise, let's assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `c` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input, `i` is `i + 1`**.

If we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `x`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `c` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `c` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input, `i` is incremented by 1**.

However, to be more specific about the state transition:

If `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `c` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input, `i` is `i + 1`**.

To be more precise:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `c` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input, `i` is `i + 1`**.
