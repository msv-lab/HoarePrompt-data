To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop evolves with each iteration and how the variables change based on the inputs provided.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t`: Number of test cases to process (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- For each test case:
  - `n`: Size of the grid (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5).
  - `k`: Number of moves (0 ≤ k ≤ n).
  - `r_i` and `c_i`: Coordinates of the moves (1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n).

### Loop Execution:
1. **Decrement `t`**: For each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1.
2. **Read `n` and `k`**: For each test case, read `n` and `k`.
3. **Calculate `num`**:
   - Initialize `num` to 0.
   - For each of the `k` moves, read `c` and `r`.
     - If `c == r`, increment `num` by 1.
     - Otherwise, increment `num` by 2.
4. **Calculate `m`**: `m = n - num`.
5. **Determine Output**:
   - If `m == 0`, print `0`.
   - If `m == 1`, print `1`.
   - If `m > 1`, compute `dp[m]` using dynamic programming and print it.

### Output State After All Iterations:
- **`t`**: Will be `0` after all iterations since it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0.
- **`n` and `k`**: These will be the values from the last test case processed.
- **`num`**: This will be the sum of 1s and 2s based on the equality of `c` and `r` for the last test case.
- **`m`**: This will be `n - num` for the last test case.
- **`dp`**: If `m > 1`, this will be the list containing the dynamic programming results up to `dp[m]` for the last test case. Otherwise, `dp` will not be computed.

### Final Output State:
- **`t`**: 0 (since all test cases have been processed).
- **`n`**: The `n` value from the last test case.
- **`k`**: The `k` value from the last test case.
- **`num`**: The sum of 1s and 2s based on the last test case's moves.
- **`m`**: The value of `n - num` for the last test case.
- **`dp`**: If `m > 1`, it will contain the dynamic programming results up to `dp[m]` for the last test case. Otherwise, it will not be defined.

### Human-readable Output State:
After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variables `n`, `k`, and `num` will reflect the values from the last test case processed. The variable `m` will be calculated as `n - num` for the last test case. If `m` is greater than 1, `dp` will contain the dynamic programming results up to `dp[m]` for the last test case.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the `n` value from the last test case, `k` is the `k` value from the last test case, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the last test case's moves, `m` is `n - num` for the last test case, and `dp` is the dynamic programming results up to `dp[m]` if `m > 1`.**
