Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's break down the problem step-by-step:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n.
- `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the equality of `c` and `r` over `k` iterations.
- `m` is `n - num`. The current value of `m` is 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(0)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the number `0`. It does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, or `m`. The value to be printed is explicitly given as `0`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the number `0`.

### Final Output:
Output: **0**
