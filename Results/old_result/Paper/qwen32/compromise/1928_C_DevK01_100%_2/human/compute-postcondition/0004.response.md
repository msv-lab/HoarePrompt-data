Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` (1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9), and `q` contains between 1 and 100 such tuples. If `w` is an integer such that `w == w // 1` and `w >= x - 1`, then `M` is a list containing the integer `w`. Otherwise, `M` remains an empty list.**
