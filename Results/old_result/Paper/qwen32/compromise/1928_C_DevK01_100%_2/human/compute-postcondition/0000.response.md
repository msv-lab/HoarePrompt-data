The provided code snippet initializes an empty list `M`. The initial state specifies that `q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` with the constraints `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 such tuples. The code does not modify `q` and only introduces a new list `M` which is initially empty.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` (1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9), and `q` contains between 1 and 100 such tuples; `M` is an empty list.**
