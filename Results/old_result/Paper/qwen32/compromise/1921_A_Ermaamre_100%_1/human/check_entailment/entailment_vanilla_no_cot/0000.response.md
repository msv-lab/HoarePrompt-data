Correctness: **False**

The provided program calculates the area of a square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and then squaring that difference. This approach only works if the square is aligned with the x-axis and its sides are parallel to the axes in such a way that the maximum and minimum x-coordinates correspond to the length of the side of the square. However, the problem specifies that the square can be located in any orientation with its sides parallel to the coordinate axes, which means the side length of the square could be determined by the difference in y-coordinates as well.

To correctly determine the area of the square, the program should consider both the x and y coordinates to find the side length. Specifically, the side length of the square can be found by calculating the distance between any two adjacent corners, which can be done by finding the maximum and minimum x and y coordinates and then determining the larger of the two differences (either max(x) - min(x) or max(y) - min(y)).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
        x = [p[0] for p in a]
        y = [p[1] for p in a]
        dx = max(x) - min(x)
        dy = max(y) - min(y)
        side_length = max(dx, dy)
        print(side_length * side_length)

func()
```

This version calculates both the difference in x-coordinates and y-coordinates, then uses the larger of the two as the side length of the square, ensuring the correct area is computed.
