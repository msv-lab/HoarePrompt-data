Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program first reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square. These coordinates are stored in a list of lists `a`, where each sublist contains a pair `[x, y]`.

2. **Extracting X-Coordinates**:
   - The program extracts the x-coordinates from the list of coordinates and stores them in the list `x`.

3. **Calculating the Side Length**:
   - The program calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates, `dx`. This difference represents the length of the side of the square.

4. **Calculating the Area**:
   - The program calculates the area of the square by squaring the side length `dx` and prints the result.

### Issues with the Approach:

- **Assumption**: The program assumes that the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates will always give the side length of the square. However, this assumption is incorrect because the side length of the square could be the difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates if the square is oriented such that its sides are parallel to the y-axis.

- **Correct Approach**: To correctly determine the side length of the square, the program should consider both the x and y coordinates. Specifically, the side length of the square is the maximum of the differences between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and the maximum and minimum y-coordinates.

### Correct Implementation:

The correct implementation should look something like this:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
        x = [p[0] for p in a]
        y = [p[1] for p in a]
        dx = max(x) - min(x)
        dy = max(y) - min(y)
        side_length = max(dx, dy)
        print(side_length * side_length)
```

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified in the provided program, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
