The provided code snippet is a function definition and does not contain any executable code that would change the initial state. Therefore, the variables `number` and `sequence` remain unchanged.

Output State: **number is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and sequence is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case.**
