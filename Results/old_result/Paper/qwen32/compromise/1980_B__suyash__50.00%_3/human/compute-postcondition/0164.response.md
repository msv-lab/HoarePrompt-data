To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the context in which the `print` statement is executed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`i` is `len(l)`**: This means `i` holds the length of the list `l`.
2. **`t` is greater than `len(l)`**: This indicates `t` is an integer greater than the length of `l`.
3. **`a` is the value of the new `input()`**: `a` is a string that the user inputs.
4. **`b` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in the previous `a` to integers**: `b` contains integers parsed from the string `a`.
5. **`o` is a list of substrings from the new input line sorted in descending order and must have at least 1 substring**: `o` is a list of substrings from another user input, sorted in descending order.
6. **`n` is the first element of `b`**: `n` is the first integer in the list `b`.
7. **`f` is the second element of `b`**: `f` is the second integer in the list `b`.
8. **`dic` is a dictionary with keys as elements from `o` and values as their respective counts in `o`**: `dic` maps each substring in `o` to the number of times it appears in `o`.
9. **`l` is a list of unique elements from `o` sorted in descending order**: `l` contains unique substrings from `o`, sorted in descending order.
10. **`k` is the third element of `b` minus the count of `l[i]` in `dic` minus `dic[l[i]]`**: `k` is calculated based on the third element of `b` and the counts of elements in `dic`.
11. **`fav` is `o[f - 1]`**: `fav` is the substring at the index `f - 1` in the list `o`.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. There is no dependency on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state that would affect the printed output.

### Conclusion:
The `print('YES')` statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
