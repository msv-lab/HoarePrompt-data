The provided Python code snippet contains the `print` statement `print('MAYBE')`. The string `'MAYBE'` is explicitly provided as the argument to the `print` function. Therefore, regardless of the values of the variables `i`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `o`, `n`, `f`, `dic`, `l`, `k`, and `fav`, the `print` statement will output the string `'MAYBE'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('MAYBE')`.
2. The string `'MAYBE'` is a literal string and does not depend on any variable or computation.
3. Therefore, the output will be exactly `'MAYBE'`.

Output: **MAYBE**
