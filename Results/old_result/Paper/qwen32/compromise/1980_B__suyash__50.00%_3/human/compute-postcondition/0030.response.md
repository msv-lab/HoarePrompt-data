To determine what will be printed when the `print('MAYBE')` statement executes, we need to analyze the provided initial state and see if any conditions or changes would affect this print statement.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `a` is an input string.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting the whitespace-separated values in `a` to integers.
- `o` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting a new input line on whitespace and sorted in descending order, and `o` must have at least one unique element.
- `n` is the first element of the list `b`.
- `f` is the second element of the list `b`.
- `k` is the third element of the list `b` minus the count of the element `l[i]` in `o` and `k` is less than 0.
- `fav` is the element in `o` at the position `f - 1`.
- `dic` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from the list `o`, and the corresponding value is the count of that element in `o`.
- If the index of `fav` in `o` is greater than `k - 1`, then the condition `o.index(fav) > k - 1` is true. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `o`, `n`, `f`, `fav`, or `dic`.
- `l` is a list of unique elements from `o` sorted in descending order, and `l` must have at least one element.
- Additionally, `fav` is equal to `l[i]`.

The `print('MAYBE')` statement does not depend on any of the conditions or changes described above. It is a standalone print statement that will execute regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `o`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `fav`, `dic`, or `l`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the string `'MAYBE'`.

Output: **MAYBE**
