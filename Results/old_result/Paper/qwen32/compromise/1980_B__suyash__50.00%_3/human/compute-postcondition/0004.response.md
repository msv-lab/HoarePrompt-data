The code `o = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace. This list is then assigned to the variable `o`.

Given the initial state, `t` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, and `b` is a list of integers derived from `a`. After executing the code snippet, the variable `o` will be a new list of substrings from the new input line.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is an input string; `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting the whitespace-separated values in `a` to integers; `o` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting a new input line on whitespace.**
