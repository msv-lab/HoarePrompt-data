a and b are integers where a represents the number of lines (N) and b represents the number of columns (M) of the field, with 3 <= a <= 99 and 3 <= b <= 99, and both a and b are odd. The field is described by a list of a strings, where each string contains b pairs of characters separated by spaces. Each pair of characters can be "..", "R0", ..., "R9", "B0", ..., "B9", "RG", "BG", ".Q", or ".B". The next input is an integer T (0 <= T <= 10000) representing the number of steps in the game, followed by T lines, each describing an action with a pair of characters representing the entity and a command (U, D, L, R, C, T).
