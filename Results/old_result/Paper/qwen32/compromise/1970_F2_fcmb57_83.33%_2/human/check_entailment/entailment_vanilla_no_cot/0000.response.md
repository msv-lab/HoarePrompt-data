Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program has several issues that affect its correctness based on the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `C` (Catch) Action:**
   - The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` is a comparison and not an assignment. It should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to correctly assign the player who is catching the Quaffle.

2. **Incorrect Handling of `T` (Throw) Action:**
   - The program checks if the player's position is in the goals for both teams (`if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']` and `if players[mo[0]] in goals['B']`). This is incorrect because it's possible for a player to be in the position of multiple goals, but the player can only score in the goal of the opposing team.
   - The program does not reset the Quaffle position to the middle of the field in all cases when a goal is scored. It only resets the position if the player's team is not the same as the goal's team, which is incorrect.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Player Elimination:**
   - The program does not handle the case where multiple players are eliminated simultaneously correctly. It only prints the elimination event for the first player found in the same position as the Bludger.

4. **Incorrect Movement Function:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined after it is used, which will cause a `NameError`. The function should be defined before it is used.

5. **Incorrect Goal Scoring Logic:**
   - The program does not correctly determine the team that scores a point. It should check if the player is in the goal of the opposing team to determine the scoring team.

6. **Incorrect Handling of Quaffle Position:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the Quaffle position when a player throws it. It should place the Quaffle at the player's current position.

7. **Incorrect Handling of Goal Scoring Output:**
   - When a player scores in the wrong goal, the program should print the name of the opposing team scoring the point, not the team of the player who scored.

To correct the program, these issues need to be addressed. Here is a corrected version of the relevant parts of the program:

```python
# Corrected part of the program

def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)

(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
middle = ((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)
quidditch = [middle, '']
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quidditch[0] = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)
moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
        z = []
        if '.B' in players:
            for (k, v) in players.items():
                if k != '.B' and v == players['.B']:
                    z.append(k)
            z.sort()
            for k in z:
                print(i, k, 'ELIMINATED')
                if quidditch[1] == k:
                    quidditch = [v, '']
                del players[k]
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        quidditch[1] = mo[0]
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        quidditch[1] = ''
        quidditch[0] = players[mo[0]]
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['R'] and mo[0][0] == 'B':
            pointsb += 1
            print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
        elif players[mo[0]] in goals['B'] and mo[0][0] == 'R':
            pointsr += 1
            print(i, 'RED GOAL')
print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)
```

This corrected version should address the issues mentioned above.
