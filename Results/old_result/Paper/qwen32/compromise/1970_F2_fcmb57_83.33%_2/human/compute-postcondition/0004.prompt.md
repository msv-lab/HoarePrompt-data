You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers where a represents the number of lines (N) and b represents the number of columns (M) of the field, with 3 <= a <= 99 and 3 <= b <= 99, and both a and b are odd. The field is described by a list of a strings, where each string contains b pairs of characters separated by spaces. Each pair of characters can be "..", "R0", ..., "R9", "B0", ..., "B9", "RG", "BG", ".Q", or ".B". The next input is an integer T (0 <= T <= 10000) representing the number of steps in the game, followed by T lines, each describing an action with a pair of characters representing the entity and a command (U, D, L, R, C, T).
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns (a + b, a + b) where a and b are odd integers between 3 and 99, making a + b an even integer between 6 and 198.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are odd integers representing the number of lines and columns of a field, respectively, with values between 3 and 99. The function returns a tuple `(a + b, a + b)`, where `a + b` is an even integer between 6 and 198.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns (a + b, a + b) where a and b are odd integers between 3 and 99, making a + b an even integer between 6 and 198.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
