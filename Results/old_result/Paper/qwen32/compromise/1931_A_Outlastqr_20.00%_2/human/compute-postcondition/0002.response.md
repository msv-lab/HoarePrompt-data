To determine the output state, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables `n` and `word` are manipulated within it. The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of iterations specified by the first input. For each iteration, `n` is re-assigned a new value and `word` is constructed based on the value of `n`.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how `word` is constructed:
- If `n > 52`, `word` becomes `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
- If `37 <= n <= 52`, `word` becomes `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
- If `3 <= n <= 36`, `word` becomes `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

Since the exact values of `n` for each iteration are not provided, we cannot determine the exact sequence of `word` outputs. However, we can describe the output state in terms of the variables that have been affected by the loop.

After the loop finishes, `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. `n` will hold the value it was assigned in the last iteration of the loop. `word` will be the last constructed word from the last iteration.

In summary, the output state will have `t` unchanged, `n` as the value from the last iteration, and `word` as the string constructed in the last iteration based on that value of `n`.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is the value from the last iteration, `word` is the string constructed in the last iteration based on that value of `n`.**
