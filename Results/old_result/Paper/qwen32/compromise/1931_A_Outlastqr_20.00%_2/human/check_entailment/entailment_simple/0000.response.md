Let's analyze the given program and the provided states to determine its correctness.

The problem requires us to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that could have been encoded to a given integer `n`. The encoding is the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet.

The program uses a strategy based on the value of `n` to construct the word:
- If `n > 52`, it constructs a word of the form `xzz`, where `x` is the letter corresponding to `n - 53`.
- If `n > 26`, it constructs a word of the form `ayz`, where `y` is the letter corresponding to `n - 28`.
- Otherwise, it constructs a word of the form `aaz`, where `z` is the letter corresponding to `n - 3`.

Let's verify if this approach works for the given examples:

1. For `n = 24`:
   - Since `24 <= 26`, it should be of the form `aaz`.
   - `z` is the letter corresponding to `24 - 3 = 21`, which is `u`.
   - The word is `aau`, but the correct word should be `aav` (since `aav` is lexicographically smaller than `aau`).
   - The program incorrectly constructs `aau`.

2. For `n = 70`:
   - Since `70 > 52`, it should be of the form `xzz`.
   - `x` is the letter corresponding to `70 - 53 = 17`, which is `q`.
   - The word is `qzz`, but the correct word should be `rzz` (since `rzz` is lexicographically smaller than `qzz`).
   - The program incorrectly constructs `qzz`.

3. For `n = 3`:
   - Since `3 <= 26`, it should be of the form `aaz`.
   - `z` is the letter corresponding to `3 - 3 = 0`, which is invalid.
   - The word is `aaa`, which is correct.

4. For `n = 55`:
   - Since `26 < 55 <= 52`, it should be of the form `ayz`.
   - `y` is the letter corresponding to `55 - 28 = 27`, which is invalid.
   - The word is `czz`, which is correct.

5. For `n = 48`:
   - Since `26 < 48 <= 52`, it should be of the form `ayz`.
   - `y` is the letter corresponding to `48 - 28 = 20`, which is `t`.
   - The word is `atz`, but the correct word should be `auz` (since `auz` is lexicographically smaller than `atz`).
   - The program incorrectly constructs `atz`.

The program fails to produce the lexicographically smallest word for several test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
