Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that corresponds to a given encoded integer, where each letter's position in the alphabet is summed to form the integer.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` representing the encoded word. The goal is to find the smallest possible three-letter word that sums to `n`.

The logic used in the program is as follows:
- If `n > 52`, the word is constructed as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
- If `n > 26` (but `n <= 52`), the word is constructed as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
- If `n <= 26`, the word is constructed as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

### Correctness Check:
Let's verify if this logic correctly produces the lexicographically smallest word for all possible values of `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78).

1. **Case 1: n > 52**
   - The program constructs the word as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
   - This means the first letter is `alphabet[n - 53]`, and the last two letters are 'z'.
   - For `n = 53`, the word is `'a' + 'zz' = 'azz'`.
   - For `n = 54`, the word is `'b' + 'zz' = 'bzz'`.
   - This logic is correct because it ensures the smallest possible first letter and the largest possible last two letters, which is lexicographically smallest.

2. **Case 2: 26 < n ≤ 52**
   - The program constructs the word as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
   - This means the first letter is 'a', the second letter is `alphabet[n - 28]`, and the last letter is 'z'.
   - For `n = 27`, the word is `'a' + 'a' + 'z' = 'aaz'`.
   - For `n = 28`, the word is `'a' + 'b' + 'z' = 'abz'`.
   - This logic is correct because it ensures the smallest possible second letter while keeping the first and last letters fixed as 'a' and 'z' respectively.

3. **Case 3: n ≤ 26**
   - The program constructs the word as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.
   - This means the first two letters are 'a', and the third letter is `alphabet[n - 3]`.
   - For `n = 3`, the word is `'aa' + 'a' = 'aaa'`.
   - For `n = 4`, the word is `'aa' + 'b' = 'aab'`.
   - This logic is correct because it ensures the smallest possible third letter while keeping the first two letters fixed as 'a'.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly handles all possible values of `n` within the given range and constructs the lexicographically smallest three-letter word for each case.

**Correctness: True**
