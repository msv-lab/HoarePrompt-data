To ensure that the for loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, and the only variable directly involved in the loop head is `t`. The variable `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use in the loop body.

Given that `t` is already defined as an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50, the loop will execute as long as `t` is within this range. Therefore, no adjustment to `t` is necessary for the loop to execute, as it already satisfies the condition for the loop to run.

Since the loop head does not involve any other variables that need to be adjusted, the state remains unchanged in terms of what is required for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50**
