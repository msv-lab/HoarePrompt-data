You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: A series of 'YES' or 'NO' outputs, with 'YES' followed by a constructed string 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times for each even `n`, and 'NO' for each odd `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer `n`. It then prints 'YES' followed by a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times if `n` is even and less than or equal to 100 characters long; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step according to the problem description.

### Problem Requirements:
1. For a given integer `n`, build a string of uppercase Latin letters.
2. The string must contain exactly `n` special characters.
3. A special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
4. If no such string exists, print "NO".
5. If such a string exists, print "YES" followed by the string itself (the string length should be at most 200).

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.

2. **Logic to Determine the String**:
   - If `n` is odd, the program prints "NO". This is because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where special characters are defined as being equal to exactly one of their neighbors.
   - If `n` is even, the program constructs a string using the pattern "AAB" repeated `n // 2` times. This ensures that there are exactly `n` special characters in the string.

3. **Checking the Length of the String**:
   - The program checks if the length of the constructed string is less than 200. If it is, it prints "YES" followed by the string.
   - If the length of the string is 200 or more, it prints "NO". However, given the pattern "AAB" and the constraint `n <= 50`, the maximum length of the string will be `3 * (50 // 2) = 75`, which is well within the limit of 200.

### Evaluation:
- The program correctly handles the case where `n` is odd by printing "NO".
- The program correctly constructs a string with exactly `n` special characters when `n` is even.
- The program ensures that the constructed string length is within the required limit.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
