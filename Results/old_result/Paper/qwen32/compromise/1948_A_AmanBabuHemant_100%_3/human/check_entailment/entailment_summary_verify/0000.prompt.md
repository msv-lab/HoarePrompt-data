You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer `n`. It then prints 'YES' followed by a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times if `n` is even and less than or equal to 100 characters long; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it incorrectly assumes that the number of special characters `n` must be even, and it fails to generate a valid string when `n` is odd. However, the problem description does not restrict `n` to be even. 

For example, consider the case when `n = 1`. The string "AAB" has 2 special characters, but we need exactly 1 special character. A valid string for `n = 1` could be "AB", which has exactly 1 special character at position 1. 

Another example is when `n = 3`. A valid string could be "AAABB", which has exactly 3 special characters at positions 1, 3, and 4.

The program should be able to generate valid strings for both even and odd values of `n`. Here's a corrected version of the program that handles both cases:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('YES')
            print('AB')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if n % 2 == 1:
                s += 'A'
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version handles the case when `n` is odd by appending an additional 'A' to the string, ensuring that the number of special characters is exactly `n`.
