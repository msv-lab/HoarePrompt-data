### Reasoning:
The problem requires constructing a string with exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The provided solution checks if `n` is even and, if so, constructs a string using the pattern "AAB" repeated `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that there are exactly `n` special characters in the string.

Here's the breakdown of the logic:

1. **Odd `n`**: The solution correctly identifies that it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors. Therefore, for odd `n`, it outputs "NO".

2. **Even `n`**: For even `n`, the solution constructs a string using the pattern "AAB". In the string "AAB", the characters 'A' at positions 1 and 3 are special (each is equal to exactly one neighbor). Therefore, repeating "AAB" `n // 2` times will result in a string with exactly `n` special characters.

3. **Length Constraint**: The solution checks that the constructed string does not exceed 200 characters. Since "AAB" is 3 characters long, the maximum length of the string for `n = 50` (the maximum possible value for `n`) would be `3 * (50 // 2) = 75` characters, which is well within the 200-character limit.

Therefore, the solution correctly handles all possible cases as per the problem statement.
