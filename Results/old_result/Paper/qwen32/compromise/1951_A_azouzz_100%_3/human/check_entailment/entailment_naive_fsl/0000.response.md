Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not follow the problem description at all. The problem description specifies a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)` that should scan subfolders within the current directory, check if their names are within a specified numeric range, and then generate corresponding `-ac.py` and `-wa.py` files for each `.html` file found in those subfolders. However, the given program instead defines a function `func_1()` that reads input values and prints "YES" or "NO" based on the count of '1's in a string and the presence of "11" in the string. This function is not related to the problem description and does not perform any of the required file generation tasks. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
