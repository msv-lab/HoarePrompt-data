Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards, and `k` is an integer representing the number of cards to exchange in each operation such that 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 2 <= k <= 100; `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The variable `frequency_table` is initialized as an empty dictionary. The values of `arr` and `k` remain unchanged.
