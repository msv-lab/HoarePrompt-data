### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the program step-by-step to ensure accuracy.

#### Problem Recap:
Given a hand of cards and a fixed integer `k`, we can perform operations where we exchange `k` cards of the same number for `k-1` cards of any numbers. The goal is to determine the minimum number of cards that can remain in the hand after performing these operations optimally.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the integer `k`.
   - It then reads the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k > n`, no operations can be performed, so the minimum number of cards left is `n`.
   - If `k == n`, we can perform one operation to exchange all `k` cards for `k-1` cards, leaving `k-1` cards.

3. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number in `nums` but truncates frequencies at `k`. This is incorrect because we need the actual frequency to determine how many operations can be performed.

4. **Logic for Minimum Cards**:
   - The program checks if `k` is in the frequency values and prints `k-1` if true, otherwise prints `n`. This logic is flawed because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of cards left after optimally performing the operations.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
- Calculate the frequency of each card number.
- Determine how many operations can be performed for each number based on its frequency.
- Calculate the remaining cards after performing the maximum possible operations.

#### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    elif k == n:
        print(k - 1)
    else:
        freq = {}
        for num in nums:
            freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
        remaining_cards = 0
        for count in freq.values():
            remaining_cards += count % k
        print(remaining_cards if remaining_cards > 0 else k - 1)
```

#### Explanation:
- **Frequency Calculation**: We calculate the actual frequency of each card number.
- **Remaining Cards Calculation**: For each frequency, we calculate the remainder when divided by `k` (i.e., `count % k`). This gives the number of cards left after performing the maximum number of operations for that number.
- **Final Output**: If the sum of these remainders is greater than 0, that is the minimum number of cards left. If the sum is 0, it means we can perform operations to reduce the number of cards to `k-1`.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the flawed frequency handling and logic for determining the minimum number of cards left.

**Final: False**
