### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the code, and the annotations.

#### Problem Analysis

The problem requires finding the minimum number of cards left after performing allowed operations any number of times. The operations involve choosing `k` cards with the same number and exchanging them for `k-1` cards with any numbers. The goal is to minimize the number of cards left in the hand.

#### Key Observations

1. **Operations Limitation**: We can only perform the operation if we have `k` cards with the same number.
2. **Goal**: Minimize the number of cards left.
3. **Strategy**: Focus on the frequency of numbers in the hand. The more frequent numbers give us more opportunities to perform the operation.

#### Issues in the Provided Program

Let's examine the provided program and the annotations:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    elif k == n:
        print(k - 1)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        if k in freq.values():
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
    return frequency_table
```

#### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Handling of Frequencies**: The `func_1` function truncates frequencies at `k`. This is incorrect because we need the actual frequency of each card to determine how many operations can be performed.
2. **Logic for Minimum Cards**: The logic to determine the minimum number of cards left is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that if `k` is in the frequency values, the result should be `k-1`, which is not necessarily true.
3. **General Approach**: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations optimally.

#### Annotations Evaluation

The annotations describe the state of the program before and after the function call. They correctly state that `frequency_table` is a dictionary where each key is a unique number from `arr` and each value is the minimum of the count of that number in `arr` and `k`. However, this truncation of frequencies is incorrect for solving the problem.

#### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we should:
- Calculate the actual frequency of each card number.
- Determine how many operations can be performed based on these frequencies.
- Calculate the remaining cards after performing the maximum possible operations.

The correct logic should involve:
- Calculating the remainder of the frequency of each card number when divided by `k`.
- Summing these remainders to get the minimum number of cards left.

#### Conclusion

Given the issues identified and the incorrect handling of frequencies, the program does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

### Final: **False**
