The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^3, and for each test case, `x` and `n` are integers where `1 <= x <= 10^8` and `1 <= n <= x`.

After the code execution, the variable `x` will hold the first integer from the input, and `n` will hold the second integer from the input. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `x` is the first integer from the input such that 1 <= x <= 10^8; `n` is the second integer from the input such that 1 <= n <= x.**
