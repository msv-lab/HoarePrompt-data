Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic for calculating the number of ships sunk is flawed. Specifically, the program attempts to determine the number of ships sunk by summing the durability of ships from the front and the back separately and comparing these sums to half of the total attacks. However, this approach does not accurately simulate the alternating attack pattern of the Kraken and does not account for the fact that ships can sink during the process, thus changing the list of ships that are available to be attacked.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should simulate the attack pattern directly, keeping track of which ships have sunk and adjusting the list of ships accordingly. This would involve repeatedly attacking the first and last ship in the list until either all ships have sunk or the number of attacks is exhausted. Given the constraints, an efficient approach would be to use a deque (double-ended queue) to efficiently remove ships from both ends.
