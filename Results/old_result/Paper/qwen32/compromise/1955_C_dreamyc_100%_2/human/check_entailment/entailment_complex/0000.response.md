Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic within `func_1` is flawed and does not accurately simulate the Kraken's attacks on the ships. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `a` and `b`:** 
   - The variables `a` and `b` are calculated as `math.ceil(k / 2)` and `k // 2` respectively. These values represent the maximum number of attacks the Kraken can make on the first and last ships, but they don't directly translate to the number of ships that will sink.

2. **Incorrect Use of Cumulative Sums (`s_a` and `s_b`):**
   - The cumulative sums `s_a` and `s_b` are calculated as the running sum from the start and end of the list `nums`. However, these sums do not reflect the actual durability of the ships after each attack.
   - The condition checks if `s_a <= a` and `s_b <= b` to increment `ans`, but this logic does not account for the fact that ships with zero durability are removed from the list and thus no longer subject to attacks.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Sinking Ships:**
   - The program does not remove ships from the list when their durability drops to zero. This means that the cumulative sums will incorrectly include the durability of ships that have already sunk.
   - The logic does not properly simulate the alternating attacks between the first and last ships, and it does not account for the fact that the list of ships changes as ships sink.

4. **Incorrect Assumption about `ans`:**
   - The variable `ans` is supposed to count the number of ships that sink, but the current logic does not accurately reflect this. Instead, it counts the number of times the cumulative sums are less than or equal to `a` and `b`, which is not the correct approach.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the Kraken's attacks by alternating between the first and last ships, decrementing their durability, and removing them from the list when they sink. This can be efficiently done using a deque to handle the removal of ships from both ends.

Correctness: **False**
