You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, and nums is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    if (k >= sum(nums)) :
        return n
        #The program returns the integer `n` which represents the number of integers in the list `nums` for each test case.
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, and nums is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. Additionally, k is less than the sum of the integers in nums.
    a, b = math.ceil(k / 2), k // 2
    ans = 0
    s_a = 0
    s_b = 0
    for i in range(n):
        s_a += nums[i]
        
        s_b += nums[n - i - 1]
        
        if s_a <= a:
            ans += 1
        
        if s_b <= b:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: `s_a` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `s_b` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, and `ans` is the total number of times `s_a` and `s_b` were less than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is the total number of times `s_a` and `s_b` were less than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of integers in the list `nums`; `k`, an integer; and `nums`, a list of `n` integers. For each test case, the function returns either the integer `n` or `ans`, which is the total number of times two conditions are met: `s_a` is less than or equal to `a` and `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`. However, based on the provided output description, it seems there might be a misunderstanding as it only specifies two distinct return cases which do not directly correlate to the parameters or a clear conditional logic. Assuming the second case is meant to be a computed value based on some internal logic not detailed here, the functionality can be described as returning either `n` or a computed `ans`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the integer `n` which represents the number of integers in the list `nums` for each test case.

Case_2: The program returns `ans`, which is the total number of times `s_a` and `s_b` were less than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
