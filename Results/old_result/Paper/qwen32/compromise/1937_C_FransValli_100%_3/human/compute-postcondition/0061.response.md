The value of `mini` is updated to be equal to `item`. The values of `t`, `n`, `maxi`, `arr`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given, `arr` is a list with at least two elements, `mini` is equal to `item`, `item` is the next element in `arr` after the current `item`, `res` is the new user's input.**
