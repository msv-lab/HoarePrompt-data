The code snippet provided is `maxi = i`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n-1`. Therefore, `maxi` is updated to the value of `i`, which is `n-1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3; `n` is greater than 1; `maxi` is `n-1`; `arr` is reset to `[i]` if `res` was `'<'`, otherwise `arr` remains unchanged; `mini` is the last element in `arr` that caused the response `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element was found; `i` is `n-1`; `res` is the value of the user's input.**
