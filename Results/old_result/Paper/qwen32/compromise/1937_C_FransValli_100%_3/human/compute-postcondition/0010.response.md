To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the variables and their values based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). The value of `t` is not used in the print statement.
2. **`n`**: An integer greater than 1. The value of `n` is not used in the print statement.
3. **`res`**: A string equal to the user's input. The value of `res` is not used in the print statement.
4. **`i`**: The variable `i` is defined as `i + 1`. However, we need to understand the initial value of `i` to determine its value after the increment. Since the initial value of `i` is not provided, we can only assume that `i` is incremented by 1 from its initial value.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```
- **`'?'`**: This is a literal string and will be printed as is.
- **`maxi`**: The variable `maxi` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine its exact value. We need to assume that `maxi` is defined somewhere in the code before this print statement.
- **`maxi`**: This is repeated and will be printed the same as the first `maxi`.
- **`i`**: The variable `i` is incremented by 1 before being printed. Since the initial value of `i` is not provided, we can only describe it as `i + 1`.
- **`i`**: This is repeated and will be printed the same as the first `i`.

### Output Description:
Given the information, the output will be:
- A literal string `'?'`.
- The value of `maxi` (which is unknown but assumed to be defined).
- The value of `maxi` again.
- The value of `i` incremented by 1.
- The value of `i` incremented by 1 again.

Therefore, the output can be described as:

Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] [i + 1] [i + 1] (where maxi is a variable defined elsewhere in the code and i is incremented by 1 from its initial value)**
