The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value between 1 and `n-1`, and `n` is greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3 (this does not affect the loop head and thus remains unchanged).
- `n` is greater than 1 (this does not need to be adjusted for the next iteration).
- `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given (this does not affect the loop head and thus remains unchanged).
- `res` is the new input string (this does not affect the loop head and thus remains unchanged).
- `arr` is either `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`, the previous `arr` with `i` appended if `res` is `'='`, or unchanged otherwise (this does not affect the loop head and thus remains unchanged).

At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given, `res` is the new input string, `arr` is either `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`, the previous `arr` with `i` appended if `res` is `'='`, or unchanged otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since we are only adjusting the loop head variables, the final adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given, `res` is the new input string, `arr` is either `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`, the previous `arr` with `i` appended if `res` is `'='`, or unchanged otherwise, `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**.

To simplify and match the required format:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given, `res` is the new input string, `arr` is either `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`, the previous `arr` with `i` appended if `res` is `'='`, or unchanged otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1**.
