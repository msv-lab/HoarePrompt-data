The code snippet assigns the value of `item` to `mini`. Since the previous state mentioned that `mini` was the first element of `arr`, and now it is being reassigned to `item`, the new value of `mini` will be whatever `item` holds.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` for which the user's input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `arr` contains at least two elements; `mini` is `item`; `i` is `n-1`; `res` is the user's input and `res` equals `'>'`.**
