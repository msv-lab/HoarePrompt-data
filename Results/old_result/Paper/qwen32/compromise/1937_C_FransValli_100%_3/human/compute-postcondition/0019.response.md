To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it updates the `maxi` variable based on the user's input.

The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. For each iteration, the loop asks for a comparison between `maxi` and `i` through the input `res`. If `res` is `'<'`, it means `maxi` is less than `i`, and `maxi` is updated to `i`. If `res` is not `'<'`, `maxi` remains unchanged.

After all iterations, `maxi` will hold the largest value of `i` for which the user's input was `'<'`. If the user never inputs `'<'`, `maxi` will remain `0`.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the final output state can be described as follows:

- `t` remains unchanged as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- `n` remains the same as the input integer.
- `maxi` will be the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`. If no such input was given, `maxi` will be `0`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given.**
