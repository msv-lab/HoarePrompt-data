The code snippet `arr = [i]` assigns a new list containing the current value of `i` to the variable `arr`. Given that `i` is 2, `arr` is now `[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is greater than 2; `maxi` is `n-1` if `res` is `'<'`, otherwise it is the largest value of `i` for which the user's input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `arr` is `[2]`; `mini` is the largest element in `arr` for which the user's input was `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists; `i` is 2; `res` is the user's new input.**
