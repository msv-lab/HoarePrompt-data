To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3. This variable does not directly affect the `print` statement.
2. **`n`**: An integer greater than 1. This variable is used to determine the value of `maxi` and `i`.
3. **`res`**: The value of the user's input, which can be `'<'` or some other value.
4. **`maxi`**: This variable's value depends on `res`. If `res` is `'<'`, then `maxi` is set to `n-1`. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0.
5. **`mini`**: This variable is not directly used in the `print` statement.
6. **`arr`**: This list is modified based on the value of `res`. If `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is reset to `[i]`. Otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged.
7. **`i`**: This variable is set to `n`.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

We need to determine the values of `maxi` and `i`:
- **`i`**: As per the initial state, `i` is set to `n`.
- **`maxi`**: The value of `maxi` depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is `'<'`, `maxi` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `maxi` is 0.

Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we need to consider both cases:

**Case 1: If `res` is `'<'`**
- `maxi` will be `n-1`.
- The `print` statement will output: `? n-1 n-1 n n`.

**Case 2: If `res` is not `'<'`**
- `maxi` will be 0.
- The `print` statement will output: `? 0 0 n n`.

Given that we don't have the exact value of `res`, we need to provide the output in a way that reflects both possibilities. However, since the task asks for the most precise description possible based on the given information, we will describe the output in terms of `n` and `res`.

Output: **? [n-1 if res is '<' else 0] [n-1 if res is '<' else 0] n n** (where `res` is the value of the user's input and `n` is an integer greater than 1)
