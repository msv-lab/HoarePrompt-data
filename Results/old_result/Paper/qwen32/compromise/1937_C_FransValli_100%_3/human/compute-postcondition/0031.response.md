The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's call it `i_end`), and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must remain greater than `i`.

Given that the loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 1`. Since `n` is already greater than `i_end`, it will still be greater than `i_end + 1` as long as `i_end + 1` is less than `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is `i_end + 1`
- `n` remains the same (greater than `i_end + 1`)

Since we don't have the exact value of `i_end`, we can express the state in terms of the previous `i` value:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given, `arr` is `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is `[0, i]` if `res` is `'='`, otherwise `arr` is `[0]`, and `res` is an input string, `i` is `i_end + 1`**

However, since we need to provide a concrete state and `i_end` is not specified, we can assume `i_end` to be the current `i` value from the previous iteration. If we denote the current `i` value from the previous iteration as `i`, then the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given, `arr` is `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is `[0, i]` if `res` is `'='`, otherwise `arr` is `[0]`, and `res` is an input string, `i` is `i + 1`**

To make it more concrete, if we assume the previous `i` value was `i_end`, then:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given, `arr` is `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is `[0, i]` if `res` is `'='`, otherwise `arr` is `[0]`, and `res` is an input string, `i` is `3 + 1` if `i_end` was `3`**

But since we don't have a specific `i_end`, the general form is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given, `arr` is `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is `[0, i]` if `res` is `'='`, otherwise `arr` is `[0]`, and `res` is an input string, `i` is `i + 1`**

So the final answer is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given, `arr` is `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is `[0, i]` if `res` is `'='`, otherwise `arr` is `[0]`, and `res` is an input string, `i` is `i + 1`**
