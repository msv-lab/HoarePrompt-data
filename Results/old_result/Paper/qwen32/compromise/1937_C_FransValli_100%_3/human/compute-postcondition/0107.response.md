The code snippet `arr.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `arr`. Given that `i` is initially 2, the list `arr` will have `2` appended to it.

Let's update the `arr` list based on the initial conditions provided:
- If `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is initially `[1]`. After appending `i`, `arr` becomes `[1, 2]`.
- If `res` is not `'='`, `arr` is initially `[0, i]` where `i` is the largest value for which the user's input was `'<'`. After appending `i`, `arr` becomes `[0, i, 2]`. Since `i` is 2, this case simplifies to `[0, 2, 2]`.
- If `res` is `'='`, `arr` is initially `[0, n-1, i]` where `i` is the largest value for which the user's input was `'<'`. After appending `i`, `arr` becomes `[0, n-1, i, 2]`. Since `i` is 2, this case simplifies to `[0, n-1, 2, 2]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `maxi`, `mini`, `i`, `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is greater than 2; `maxi` is `n-1` if `res` is `'<'`, otherwise it is the largest value of `i` for which the user's input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `arr` is `[1, 2]` if `res` is `'<'`, `[0, 2, 2]` if `res` is not equal to `'='`, and `[0, n-1, 2, 2]` if `res` is `'='`; `mini` is the largest element in `arr` for which the user's input was `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists; `i` is 2; `res` is the user's new input.**
