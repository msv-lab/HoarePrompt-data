The code snippet `arr = [0]` resets the list `arr` to contain only the integer `0`. The values of the other variables `t`, `n`, `maxi`, `mini`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3; `n` is the new input integer; `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was given; `arr` is `[0]`; `mini` is the last element in `arr` that caused the response `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element was found; `i` is `n-1`.**
