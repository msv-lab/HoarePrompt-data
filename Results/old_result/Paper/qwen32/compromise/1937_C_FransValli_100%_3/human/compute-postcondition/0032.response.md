To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the initial state and understand the values of the variables involved.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to \(n-1\)) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given.
- `arr` is defined based on the value of `res`:
  - If `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is `[i]`.
  - If `res` is `'='`, `arr` is `[0, i]`.
  - Otherwise, `arr` is `[0]`.
- `res` is an input string.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

Let's break down the values:
- `'?'` is a constant string.
- `maxi` is the largest value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given.
- `arr[0]` depends on the value of `res`:
  - If `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is `[i]`, so `arr[0]` is `i`.
  - If `res` is `'='`, `arr` is `[0, i]`, so `arr[0]` is `0`.
  - Otherwise, `arr` is `[0]`, so `arr[0]` is `0`.
- `maxi` is repeated.
- `i` is the current value of `i`, which is `i + 1` from the previous value.

### Output Description:
The output will be formatted as:
- A question mark `'?'`.
- The value of `maxi`.
- The value of `arr[0]` which depends on `res`.
- The value of `maxi` again.
- The value of `i`.

Given the initial state, we can summarize the output as follows:

- If `res` is `'<'`, `arr[0]` is `i`.
- If `res` is `'='` or any other value, `arr[0]` is `0`.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **? maxi arr[0] maxi i (where maxi is the largest value of i for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such input was given, arr[0] is i if res is '<', otherwise 0, and i is the current value of i)**

To provide a more concrete example, let's assume some values:
- Suppose `maxi` is 5.
- Suppose `res` is `'<'`.
- Suppose `i` is 6 (since `i` is incremented by 1).

Then the output would be:
Output: **? 5 6 5 6**

However, since the exact values of `maxi`, `res`, and `i` are not provided, the most precise description based on the given information is:

Output: **? maxi arr[0] maxi i (where maxi is the largest value of i for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such input was given, arr[0] is i if res is '<', otherwise 0, and i is the current value of i)**
