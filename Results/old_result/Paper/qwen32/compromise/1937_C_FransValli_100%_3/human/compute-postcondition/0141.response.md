The code snippet `res = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `res`. This means the value of `res` will change based on whatever input the user provides. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `maxi`, `arr`, `mini`, `i`) are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3; `n` is greater than 1; `maxi` is `n-1` if `res` was `'<'`, otherwise `maxi` remains 0; `arr` is reset to `[i]` if `res` was `'<'`, otherwise `arr` remains unchanged; `mini` is the last element in `arr` that caused the response `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element was found; `i` is `n-1`; `res` is the value of the user's input.**
