The code snippet provided initializes a list `arr` with a single element `0`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `maxi` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given; `arr` is `[0]`.**
