Let's break down the provided initial state and analyze the print statement step by step:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3. However, `t` is not used in the print statement.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was given. Since no responses are mentioned in the initial state, `maxi` is 0.
- `arr` is `[0]`, meaning it is a list containing a single element, 0.
- `mini` is the last element in `arr` that caused the response `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element was found. Again, since no responses are mentioned, `mini` is the first element of `arr`, which is 0.
- `i` is `n-1`. Since `n` is greater than 1, `i` is at least 0 (if `n` is 2, `i` would be 1).

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

Let's substitute the known values:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `maxi` is 0.
- `arr[0]` is 0 (since `arr` is `[0]`).
- `maxi` is 0 (repeated).
- `i` is `n-1` (which is at least 1 if `n` is 2, but without a specific value of `n`, we can only say it is `n-1`).

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can only describe `i` as `n-1`. However, we know that `i` is at least 1 because `n` must be greater than 1.

Putting it all together, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 0 n-1 (where n is greater than 1)**
