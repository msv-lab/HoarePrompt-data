### Reasoning:

The given program aims to find a pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that the bitwise XOR of \(p_i\) and \(p_j\) is maximized, using at most \(3n\) queries. Let's analyze the program step by step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation \(n\).

2. **Finding the Maximum Element**:
   - The program initializes `maxi` to 0, assuming initially that \(p_0\) is the maximum element.
   - It iterates over the indices from 1 to \(n-1\).
   - For each index \(i\), it performs a query to compare \(p_{\text{maxi}} \mid p_{\text{maxi}}\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\).
     - Since \(x \mid x = x\) for any integer \(x\), this query effectively compares \(p_{\text{maxi}}\) with \(p_i\).
     - If the result is `<`, it means \(p_i > p_{\text{maxi}}\), so it updates `maxi` to \(i\).
   - After this loop, `maxi` holds the index of the maximum element in the permutation.
   - This step uses \(n-1\) queries.

3. **Finding Candidates for Minimum Element**:
   - The program initializes `arr` with the index `maxi`.
   - It iterates over the indices from 1 to \(n-1\).
   - For each index \(i\), it performs a query to compare \(p_{\text{maxi}} \mid p_{\text{arr[0]}}\) with \(p_{\text{maxi}} \mid p_i\).
     - This query helps in identifying indices that, when XORed with the maximum element, could potentially yield a high XOR value.
     - If the result is `<`, it means \(p_i\) is a better candidate for \(p_j\) (since it implies \(p_{\text{arr[0]}} < p_i\)), so it updates `arr` to \([i]\).
     - If the result is `=`, it means \(p_i\) is also a candidate, so it appends \(i\) to `arr`.
   - After this loop, `arr` contains indices that could be good candidates for \(p_j\).
   - This step uses \(n-1\) queries.

4. **Finding the Minimum Element Among Candidates**:
   - The program initializes `mini` to the first element of `arr`.
   - It iterates over the remaining elements in `arr`.
   - For each element `item` in `arr` (starting from the second element), it performs a query to compare \(p_{\text{mini}} \mid p_{\text{mini}}\) with \(p_{\text{item}} \mid p_{\text{item}}\).
     - This query helps in identifying the smallest element among the candidates.
     - If the result is `>`, it means \(p_{\text{item}}\) is smaller, so it updates `mini` to `item`.
   - After this loop, `mini` holds the index of the smallest element among the candidates.
   - This step uses at most \(n-2\) queries (since there are at most \(n-1\) candidates).

5. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the indices `maxi` and `mini` as the pair that maximizes the XOR value.
   - This step uses 1 output, which is not counted as a query.

### Total Queries:
- The total number of queries used by the program is \((n-1) + (n-1) + (n-2) = 3n - 4\), which is less than \(3n\).

### Correctness:
- The program correctly identifies the maximum element in the permutation.
- It correctly identifies a set of candidate indices that could yield a high XOR value when XORed with the maximum element.
- It correctly identifies the smallest element among these candidates, which, when XORed with the maximum element, should yield the maximum possible XOR value.
- The program outputs the correct pair of indices.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
