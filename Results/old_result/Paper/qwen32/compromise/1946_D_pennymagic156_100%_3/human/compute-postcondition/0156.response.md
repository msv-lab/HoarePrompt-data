To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

Given:
- Initial State: `val` is the second element of `a`.
- Code Snippet: `op ^= val >> i & 1`

Here's what the code does:
- `val >> i` shifts the bits of `val` to the right by `i` positions.
- `& 1` performs a bitwise AND operation with 1, which extracts the least significant bit (LSB) of the result from the shift operation.
- `^=` performs an in-place XOR operation between `op` and the extracted bit.

Since the exact values of `val`, `i`, and `op` are not specified, we'll express the new value of `op` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`val` is the second element of `a`; `op` is updated to `op ^ ((val >> i) & 1)`**

This means that `op` now holds the result of its original value XORed with the least significant bit of `val` shifted `i` places to the right. All other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.
