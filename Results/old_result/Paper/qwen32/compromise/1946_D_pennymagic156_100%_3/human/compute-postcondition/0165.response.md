Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` contains elements from the original `a` where the cumulative XOR of the `i`-th bits results in 0. `t` is an empty list. `i` is 0. `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`. If `u == 0`, the state remains unchanged. If `u != 0`, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`. If `v` is odd, the state remains unchanged. If `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times `op` became 0 during the loop, and `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `v` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
