Let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

The code snippet is:
```python
op ^= val >> i & 1
```

Here's what happens:
- `val >> i & 1` shifts the bits of `val` to the right by `i` positions and then performs a bitwise AND with `1`. This operation extracts the `i`-th bit of `val`.
- `op ^= ...` performs a bitwise XOR between the current value of `op` and the extracted `i`-th bit of `val`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `a` contains at least two elements.
- `t` is an empty list.
- `i` is 0.
- `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and `u` is not equal to 0.
- `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` such that `v % 2` is equal to 0 and `v` is non-zero.
- `op` is 0.
- `cnt` is 1.
- `val` is the second element of `a`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `op` will be updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`. Since `i` is 0, `val >> i & 1` simply extracts the 0-th bit of `val`.

Therefore, the new value of `op` will be `0 ^ (val & 1)` which simplifies to `val & 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains at least two elements, `t` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` such that `v % 2` is equal to 0 and `v` is non-zero, `op` is `val & 1`, `cnt` is 1, `val` is the second element of `a`**.
