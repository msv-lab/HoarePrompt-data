Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains elements from the original `a` where the cumulative XOR of the `i`-th bits results in 0, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 1, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and is not equal to 0, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`, and `v % 2` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values.
