To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which is `val` in this case. The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `a` contains at least two elements.
- `ans` is -1.
- `i` is 1.
- `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`.
- `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`.
- `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.
- `ai` is 0 if `op` is 0, otherwise `ai` remains unchanged.
- `val` is the second element of `a`.
- `t` is a list containing `ai` if `op` is 0; otherwise, `t` remains an empty list.

Since the loop iterates over each element in `a`, at the start of the next iteration, `val` will be the next element in the list `a`. Given that `val` was the second element of `a` at the end of the previous iteration, it follows that at the start of the next iteration, `val` will be the third element of `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains at least two elements, `ans` is -1, `i` is 1, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `ai` is 0 if `op` is 0, otherwise `ai` remains unchanged, `val` is the third element of `a`, and `t` is a list containing `ai` if `op` is 0; otherwise, `t` remains an empty list.**
