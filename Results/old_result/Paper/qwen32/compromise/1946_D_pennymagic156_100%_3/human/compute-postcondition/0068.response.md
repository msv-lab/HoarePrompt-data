The code snippet `ai ^= val` updates the value of `ai` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between its current value and `val`. 

Given the initial state, `ai` is initially 0. After executing the code, `ai` will be equal to `val` because `0 XOR val` results in `val`.

The other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `i`, `u`, `v`, `op`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains at least one element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 1, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `ai` is `val`**.
