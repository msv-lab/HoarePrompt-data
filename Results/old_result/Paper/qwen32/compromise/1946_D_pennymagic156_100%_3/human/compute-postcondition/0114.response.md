The code snippet updates the values of `u` and `v` based on the current values of `x`, `a`, and `i`.

- `u` is updated to the `i`-th bit of `x` using the expression `x >> i & 1`.
- `v` is updated to the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in the list `a` using the expression `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`.

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `t`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` contains elements from the original `a` where the cumulative XOR of the `i`-th bits results in 0. `t` is an empty list. `i` is 0. `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`. `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`.**
