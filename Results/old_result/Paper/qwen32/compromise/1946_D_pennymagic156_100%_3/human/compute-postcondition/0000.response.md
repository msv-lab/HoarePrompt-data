The code snippet assigns the values returned by the function `func_3()` to the variables `n` and `x`. Since the specific implementation of `func_3()` is not provided, we can only infer that `n` and `x` will take on whatever values `func_3()` returns.

Given that `n` was initially described as a positive integer representing the length of the array `a`, and `x` was a non-negative integer less than \(2^{30}\), after executing the code, `n` and `x` will now hold the values returned by `func_3()`. The array `a` remains unchanged unless `func_3()` modifies it, which is not indicated in the given code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is less than \(2^{30}\).**
