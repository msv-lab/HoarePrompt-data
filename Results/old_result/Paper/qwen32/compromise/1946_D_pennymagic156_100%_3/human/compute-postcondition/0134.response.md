The code snippet provided is `ai ^= val`. This line performs an in-place bitwise XOR operation between `ai` and `val`, updating the value of `ai`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `a` contains at least three elements.
- `t` is a list containing `ai` if `op` was 0 and now also contains the new `ai` if `op` was 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`.
- `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`.
- `op` is the `i`-th bit of `val` XORed with the original `op` XORed with the `i`-th bit of `val`.
- `ai` is 0 if `op` was 0.
- `val` is the third element in `a`.

After executing `ai ^= val`, the value of `ai` changes to `ai XOR val`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains at least three elements, `t` is a list containing `ai` if `op` was 0 and now also contains the new `ai` if `op` was 0, `i` is 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is the `i`-th bit of `val` XORed with the original `op` XORed with the `i`-th bit of `val`, `ai` is `ai XOR val`, `val` is the third element in `a`.**
