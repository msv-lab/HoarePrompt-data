Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains elements from the original `a` where the cumulative XOR of the `i`-th bits results in 0, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` has completed its iterations from 29 down to 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and varies with each iteration, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` and varies with each iteration, `op` and `ai` are determined by the XOR operations within the loop. If during any iteration `u` is not 0 and `v` is even and non-zero, `ans` is set to `cnt`, where `cnt` is the total number of times the total number of elements in `a` whose `i`-th bit is 1 is even across all bits. If `v` is 0, `ans` remains -1 and the loop breaks.**
