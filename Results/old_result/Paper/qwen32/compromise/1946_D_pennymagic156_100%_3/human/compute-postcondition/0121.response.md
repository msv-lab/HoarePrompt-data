The code snippet provided is `ai ^= val`. This operation performs a bitwise XOR between the current value of `ai` and `val`, and assigns the result back to `ai`.

Given the Initial State:
- `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `a` contains at least one element.
- `t` is an empty list.
- `i` is 0.
- `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`.
- `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`.
- `op` is the `i`-th bit of `val`.
- `ai` is 0.

After executing `ai ^= val`, the value of `ai` will be the result of `0 ^ val`, which is simply `val`.

Therefore, the updated Output State is:

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains at least one element, `t` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is the `i`-th bit of `val`, `ai` is `val`.**
