Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()` and must have at least one element, `t` is a list containing `[val]` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` remains an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` will iterate from 29 down to 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and currently is 0, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` and currently is even, `op` is 0, and `ai` is 0.**
