The given line of code performs a bitwise XOR operation between `op` and the `i`-th bit of `val`. Let's break down the changes:

- `op ^= val >> i & 1`: This line modifies the value of `op`. The expression `val >> i & 1` extracts the `i`-th bit of `val` (by shifting `val` right by `i` positions and then performing a bitwise AND with `1`). The result of this expression is then XORed with the current value of `op`.

Given the initial state:
- `op` is the `i`-th bit of `val`.
- `val` is the first element in the list `a`.

After the operation, `op` will be updated to the result of the XOR operation.

Since the problem specifies that `op` is the `i`-th bit of `val` initially, and the operation updates `op` to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, the new value of `op` will be `0` if the `i`-th bit of `val` was `1` initially (because `1 ^ 1 = 0`), and `1` if the `i`-th bit of `val` was `0` initially (because `0 ^ 1 = 1`).

Thus, the value of `op` will toggle between `0` and `1` depending on its initial value.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()` and must have at least two elements, `t` is a list containing `[val, val]` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` remains an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` will iterate from 29 down to 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and currently is 0, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` and currently is even, `op` is toggled (if it was 0, it is now 1, and if it was 1, it is now 0), `ai` is 0 if `op` is 0, otherwise `ai` remains unchanged, `val` is the first element in the list `a`.**
