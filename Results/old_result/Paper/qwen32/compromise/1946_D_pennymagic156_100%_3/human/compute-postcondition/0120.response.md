The code snippet `op ^= val >> i & 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `op` and the `i`-th bit of `val`. 

Here's the breakdown:
- `val >> i` shifts the bits of `val` to the right by `i` positions.
- `& 1` extracts the least significant bit (which is the `i`-th bit of the original `val` after the shift).
- `^=` performs an in-place XOR operation between `op` and the extracted bit.

Given the initial state, `op` is initially 0, and `i` is 0. The value of `val` is not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred from the context that `val` might be related to `x` or another element in `a` since `u` and `v` are defined in terms of bits of `x` and elements of `a`.

Since the exact value of `val` is not provided, we will denote the `i`-th bit of `val` as `bit_val_i`. After the operation, `op` will be updated to `op ^ bit_val_i`.

Therefore, the new value of `op` will be `0 ^ bit_val_i`, which simplifies to `bit_val_i` because XOR with 0 does not change the value.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains at least one element, `t` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is the `i`-th bit of `val`, `ai` is 0**.
