You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

    1
    2
    3
    -1
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and the problem requirements in detail.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
- We need to split the array `a` into the maximum number of contiguous subarrays (segments) `[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], ..., [l_k, r_k]` such that:
  - `l_1 = 1` and `r_k = n`.
  - `l_i <= r_i` for all `i` from `1` to `k`.
  - `r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1}` for all `i` from `1` to `k - 1`.
  - The bitwise OR of the bitwise XORs of these segments should be less than or equal to `x`.

### Issues in the Provided Code:
1. **Incorrect Bitwise Operations Handling**:
   - The code attempts to handle bitwise operations but does not correctly compute the XOR of segments and their OR.
   - The code iterates over bits from the most significant bit to the least significant bit (`for i in range(29, -1, -1)`), which is unnecessary and incorrect for this problem.
   - The logic inside the loop does not correctly simulate the process of splitting the array into segments and checking the conditions.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting Segments**:
   - The code tries to split the array based on the parity of the sum of bits, which is not the correct approach.
   - The code does not maintain the cumulative XOR of segments and check if the OR of these cumulative XORs is within the limit `x`.

3. **Lack of Proper Segment Calculation**:
   - The code does not properly calculate the maximum number of segments `k` that satisfy the conditions.
   - The logic for maintaining the segments and their XORs is flawed.

### Example Case Where the Code Fails:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
5 0
0 1 2 2 1
```
According to the problem statement, the correct output should be `-1` because no matter how we split the array, the OR of the XORs of the segments will not be `0`.

However, the provided code will likely output an incorrect result for this case due to the flawed logic.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
1. Iterate through the array and keep a running XOR of the elements.
2. Check if the running XOR can be reset to `0` (or a value that keeps the OR condition satisfied) without violating the segment constraints.
3. Count the maximum number of such segments.

Here is a corrected version of the code:
```python
def solve():
    import sys
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        x = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        
        current_xor = 0
        segment_count = 0
        valid = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            current_xor ^= a[i]
            if (current_xor | x) == x:
                segment_count += 1
                current_xor = 0
                valid = True
        
        if valid:
            results.append(segment_count)
        else:
            results.append(-1)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Uncomment the following line to run the function
# solve()
```

This corrected code properly handles the segment calculation and checks the conditions as required by the problem statement.
