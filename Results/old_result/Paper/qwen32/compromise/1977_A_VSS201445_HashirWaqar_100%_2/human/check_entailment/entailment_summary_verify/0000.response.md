### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Nikita starts with 0 cubes.
- In each move, he can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube.
- We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Minimum Moves Required**: To have `m` cubes, Nikita needs at least `m` moves (all of which must be additions). Therefore, `n` must be at least `m`.
2. **Parity of Moves**: If `n` is the total number of moves and `m` is the final number of cubes, the number of addition moves must be `m` plus the number of removal moves. If `n - m` is even, it is possible to distribute the moves such that the final count is `m`.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program uses the following logic:
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
- It checks if `n >= m` and if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`.
- If both conditions are true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

#### Function Summary:
The function summary correctly describes the logic of the program: it checks if `n >= m` and if the difference `(n - m)` is even.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle cases where `n < m`. However, the provided program does indeed handle this case correctly. Here's why:
- The condition `n >= m` ensures that if `n` is less than `m`, the program will print "NO". This is because it is impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves if each move can only add or remove one cube.

#### Test Case Analysis:
Let's verify the logic with the test case provided in the original assessment:
- Input: `1\n2 3`
- Here, `n = 2` and `m = 3`.
- Since `n < m`, the condition `n >= m` is false, and the program correctly prints "NO".

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly claims that the program is wrong because it does not handle `n < m`. However, the program does handle this case by checking if `n >= m`. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description and the function summary.
