You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each of the t test cases, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: For each of the t test cases, the program will output either 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether n is greater than or equal to m and (n - m) is even. The values of t, n, and m will remain as per the input, but the program will have printed the result for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it checks if the integer `n` is greater than or equal to the integer `m` and if the difference `(n - m)` is even. It prints 'YES' if both conditions are met, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged after processing each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it does not account for the scenario where the number of moves `n` is less than the number of cubes `m`. In such a case, it is impossible for Nikita to build a tower with `m` cubes because he can only add or remove one cube at a time. The current logic only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference `(n - m)` is even, which is not sufficient.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
2 3
```
In this case, `n = 2` and `m = 3`. It is impossible for Nikita to end up with 3 cubes after only 2 moves, regardless of whether he adds or removes cubes. The program should output "No" for this case, but the current logic will output "YES" because `(n - m) % 2 == -1 % 2 == 1`, which is not checked correctly.

A correct implementation should account for the possibility that `n` is less than `m` and output "No" in such cases. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Corrected version
def func_corrected():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        elif n < m:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example of the corrected version handling the problematic case
# Input: 1\n2 3
# Output: NO
```

Thus, the original program is incorrect due to the missing check for `n < m`.
