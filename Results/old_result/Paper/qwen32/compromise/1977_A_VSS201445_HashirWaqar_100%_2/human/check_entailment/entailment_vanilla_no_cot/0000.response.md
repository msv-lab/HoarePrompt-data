Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move. We need to determine if, after `n` moves, Nikita can have exactly `m` cubes in the tower.

### Key Observations:
1. **Number of Moves**: If `n` is the number of moves, the maximum number of cubes that can be added is `n` (if all moves are additions).
2. **Parity Consideration**: Since each move either adds or removes exactly one cube, the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes (`n - m`) must be even for it to be possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes. This is because each addition and each removal changes the count of cubes by 1, so the net change must be an even number to reach a specific count `m` from 0.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`. It then checks if `n` is at least `m` (so that it's possible to add enough cubes) and if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` (to ensure the net number of additions and removals is even).

- **Condition `n >= m`**: Ensures that the number of moves is sufficient to reach `m` cubes by adding cubes.
- **Condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0`**: Ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes can be achieved through an even number of additions and removals.

These conditions together are sufficient to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic needed to determine if Nikita can build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
