### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to ensure the correctness of the solution.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case.
   - It reads the permutation `p` and the score array `a` correctly.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program correctly checks if the scores at Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions are equal to the maximum score in the array `a`. If so, it outputs "Draw".
   - If only Bodya's starting position has the maximum score, it outputs "Bodya".
   - If only Sasha's starting position has the maximum score, it outputs "Sasha".

3. **Game Simulation:**
   - The program simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - For each turn, it checks if Bodya or Sasha has reached a position with the maximum score (`maxa`). If so, it marks that player as `found` and adds the maximum score for the remaining turns.
   - If neither player has reached the maximum score, it adds the score at the current position to the respective player's score and moves the player to the next position in the permutation.

4. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the cumulative scores for Bodya and Sasha.
   - It then calculates the potential scores for each player if they stay at their current position for the remaining turns.
   - It finds the maximum potential score for each player.

5. **Determine Winner:**
   - The program compares the maximum potential scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It outputs "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, and "Draw" if their scores are equal.

### Detailed Analysis Using Annotations:

- **State before function call:**
  - The annotations confirm that the input is parsed correctly and the initial conditions are set up properly.

- **Initial Checks:**
  - The annotations show that the program correctly identifies if the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha have the maximum score and outputs the correct result based on this.

- **Game Simulation:**
  - The annotations confirm that the program correctly simulates the game for `k` turns. It correctly checks if a player reaches a position with the maximum score and updates their score accordingly.
  - The annotations also confirm that the program correctly moves players to the next position in the permutation if they do not reach the maximum score.

- **Score Calculation:**
  - The annotations show that the program correctly calculates the cumulative scores for Bodya and Sasha.
  - The annotations also confirm that the program correctly calculates the potential scores if the players stay at their current position for the remaining turns.

- **Determine Winner:**
  - The annotations confirm that the program correctly compares the maximum potential scores of Bodya and Sasha and outputs the correct winner.

### Conclusion:

The annotations validate that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and calculates the scores accurately.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
