Output State: **`preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` that must have at least `len(pres)` elements, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list containing the elements `preb[0] + (k-1) * b[0]`, `preb[1] + (k-2) * b[1]`, ..., `preb[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * b[len(pres)-1]`, `ptss` is a list containing the elements `pres[0] + (k-1) * s[0]`, `pres[1] + (k-2) * s[1]`, ..., `pres[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * s[len(pres)-1]`, `i` is `len(pres) - 1`, `rem` is `k - len(pres)`**.

In simpler terms, the loop continues to run until it has processed all elements in `pres`. For each element in `pres`, it calculates a new value by adding the corresponding element in `preb` to `rem` times the corresponding element in `b` (and similarly for `ptss` using `pres` and `s`). The variable `rem` decreases by 1 with each iteration, starting from `k-1` and ending at `k - len(pres)`. The final state includes all these calculated values stored in `ptsb` and `ptss`, and the loop index `i` will be the last index of `pres`.
