The given Python code snippet consists of a single `print` statement that outputs the string `'Draw'`. The initial state provides several variables and their relationships, but none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement itself. Therefore, the value to be printed is explicitly given by the string `'Draw'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Print Statement**: The `print` statement is `print('Draw')`.
2. **Analyze the String**: The string `'Draw'` is a literal string and does not depend on any variables or their values.
3. **Determine the Output**: Since the string is not dynamic and does not change based on any input or variable values, the output will be exactly `'Draw'`.

Thus, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **Draw**
