The code snippet appends a new element to the `ptss` list. This new element is calculated as `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so the new element is `pres[1] + rem * s[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` that must have at least 1 element, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list containing the elements `preb[0] + rem * b[0]` and `preb[1] + rem * b[1]`, `ptss` is a list containing the elements `pres[0] + rem * s[0]` and `pres[1] + rem * s[1]`, `i` is 1, `rem` is `k - 2`.**
