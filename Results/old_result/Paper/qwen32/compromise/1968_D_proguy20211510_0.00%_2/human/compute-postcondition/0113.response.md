The code snippet appends a value to the list `ptsb`. This value is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`. Given that `i` is `k - 1`, `preb[i]` is the cumulative sum of `b` up to the last index, and `rem` is 0, the value being appended to `ptsb` is simply `preb[k - 1]`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` remain as given.
- `b` and `s` are lists of length `k` with values determined by the loop conditions.
- `i` remains `k - 1`.
- `preb` remains a list containing the cumulative sums of `b` up to each index.
- `pres` remains a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index.
- `sb` remains the sum of all elements in `b`.
- `ss` remains the sum of all elements in `s`.
- `ptsb` now contains one additional element, which is `preb[k - 1]`.
- `ptss` remains an empty list.
- `rem` remains 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `b` and `s` are lists of length `k` with values determined by the loop conditions; `i` is `k - 1`; `preb` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `b` up to each index; `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index; `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`; `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`; `ptsb` is a list containing `preb[k - 1]`; `ptss` is an empty list; `rem` is 0.**
