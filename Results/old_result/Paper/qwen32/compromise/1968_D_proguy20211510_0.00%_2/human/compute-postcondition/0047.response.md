The code snippet `s.append(a[ps - 1])` adds the element at index `ps - 1` of the list `a` to the list `s`. Given that `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, this means `maxa` is appended to `s`.

Here are the variables and their states:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (unchanged).
- `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `foundb` are as given (unchanged).
- `i` is 0 (unchanged).
- `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa` (unchanged).
- `foundb` determines the contents of `b` (unchanged).
- `founds` is true, so `s` includes an additional element `(k - 1) * maxa` (unchanged, but now with an additional element `maxa`).

The list `s` now includes an additional element `maxa`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `foundb` are as given; `i` is 0; `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`; if `foundb` is true, `b` includes an additional element `maxa`; if `foundb` is false, `b` includes the element `a[pb - 1]` at the end, and `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`; `founds` is true, so `s` includes elements `(k - 1) * maxa` and `maxa`.**
