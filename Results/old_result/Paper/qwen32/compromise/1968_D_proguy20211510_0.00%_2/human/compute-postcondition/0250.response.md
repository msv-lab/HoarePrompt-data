Output State: **`preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` that must have at least `len(pres)` elements, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list containing the elements `preb[0] + (k-1) * b[0]`, `preb[1] + (k-2) * b[1]`, ..., `preb[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * b[len(pres)-1]`, `ptss` is a list containing the elements `pres[0] + (k-1) * s[0]`, `pres[1] + (k-2) * s[1]`, ..., `pres[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * s[len(pres)-1]`, `i` is `len(pres) - 1`, `rem` is `k - len(pres)`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`**.

In simpler terms, the output state is the same as the initial state except that `maxs` and `maxb` have been calculated and assigned the maximum values from `ptss` and `ptsb` respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
