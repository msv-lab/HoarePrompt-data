The code snippet `s.append(a[ps - 1])` appends the element at index `ps - 1` of list `a` to list `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `foundb`, `founds`, `b`, `i`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` remain unchanged except for `s`, which now includes the new element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `pb` and `ps` are integers; `p` is a list of integers; `a` is a list of integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`; `foundb` is unchanged; `founds` is True; `b`, `i`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` are recalculated based on the new `founds` value if `foundb` is True; `s` includes the element `a[ps - 1]`.**
