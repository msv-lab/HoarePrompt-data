The `print('Sasha')` statement is a straightforward print statement that outputs the string 'Sasha'. The initial state provides information about various variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`), but none of these variables are used in the print statement. Therefore, the output is simply the string 'Sasha'.

Output: **Sasha**
