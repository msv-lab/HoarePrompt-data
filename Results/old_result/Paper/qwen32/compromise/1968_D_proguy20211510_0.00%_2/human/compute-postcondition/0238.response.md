The variable `rem` is assigned the value `k - (i + 1)`. The values of `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, and `i` remain unchanged. Since `i` is initially 0, `rem` becomes `k - 1`.

Output State: **`preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` that must have at least 1 element, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `rem` is `k - 1`**.
