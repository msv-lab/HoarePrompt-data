Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1. If `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `founds` is set to True and `s` includes an additional element `(k - 1) * maxa`. Otherwise, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]` and `s` includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]`.**
