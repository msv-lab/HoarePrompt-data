The code appends a calculated value to the list `b`. The value being appended is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. Given that `i` is 0, the expression simplifies to `(k - 1) * maxa`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `b`, `s`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `foundb` and `founds` are both true; `b` now includes an additional element `(k - 1) * maxa`.**
