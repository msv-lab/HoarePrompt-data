Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `pb` and `ps` are integers; `p` is a list of integers; `a` is a list of integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`. If `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, `b` is `[-maxa, maxa, maxa]` or `[-maxa, maxa, a[pb - 1]]`, `s` is `[-maxa, maxa, maxa]` or `[-maxa, maxa, a[pb - 1]]`, `i` is `k`, `preb` is `[-maxa, 0]`, `pres` is `[-maxa]`, `sb` is `0`, `ss` is `-maxa`, `ptsb` and `ptss` are recalculated based on the new `preb`, `b`, `pres`, and `s`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, recalculated if `founds` is True, and `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, recalculated if `foundb` is True. If `foundb` is True and `founds` is False, `b` and `s` are recalculated based on the new conditions, `i` is `k`, `preb` and `pres` are recalculated based on the new `b` and `s`, `sb` and `ss` are recalculated based on the new `b` and `s`, `ptsb` and `ptss` are recalculated based on the new `preb`, `b`, `pres`, and `s`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, recalculated if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, and `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, recalculated if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True. If `foundb` is False, the values of `b`, `i`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` retain their previous values. If `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, `foundb` is set to True, and `founds` is True, `b` is `[-maxa, maxa, a[pb - 1]]`, `s` is `[-maxa, maxa, a[pb - 1]]`, `i` is `k`, `preb` is `[-maxa, 0]`, `pres` is `[-maxa]`, `sb` is `0`, `ss` is `-maxa`, `ptsb` and `ptss` are recalculated based on the new `preb`, `b`, `pres`, and `s`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, recalculated if `founds` is True, and `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, recalculated if `foundb` is True. If `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, `foundb` is set to True, and `founds` is False, `b` and `s` are recalculated based on the new conditions, `i` is `k`, `preb` and `pres` are recalculated based on the new `b` and `s`, `sb` and `ss` are recalculated based on the new `b` and `s`, `ptsb` and `ptss` are recalculated based on the new `preb`, `b`, `pres`, and `s`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, recalculated if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, and `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, recalculated if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True. If `a[pb - 1] != maxa` and `foundb` is True, `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`, and the values of `b`, `i`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` are recalculated based on the new conditions. If `a[pb - 1] != maxa` and `foundb` is False, the values of `b`, `i`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` retain their previous values.**

In simpler terms, the list `s` has had `maxa` appended to it. All other variables retain their previous values.
