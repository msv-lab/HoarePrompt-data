The code appends a new value to the `ptss` list. The new value is calculated as `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is `k`, and `rem` is `-1`. Therefore, the new value being appended to `ptss` is `pres[k] + (-1) * s[k]`, which simplifies to `pres[k] - s[k]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `b` and `s` are lists of length `k` with values determined by the loop conditions; `i` is `k`; `preb` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `b` up to each index; `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index; `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`; `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`; `ptsb` is a list containing `preb[k - 1], preb[k - 1], preb[k] - b[k]`; `ptss` is a list containing `pres[k - 1], pres[k - 1], pres[k] - s[k]`; `rem` is -1.**
