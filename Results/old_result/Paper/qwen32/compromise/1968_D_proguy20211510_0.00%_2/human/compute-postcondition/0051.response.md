Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, `a`, `maxa` are as given; `i` is 0; `k` is greater than 0; `founds` is true if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise `founds` is false and `s` includes the element `a[ps - 1]` at the end, with `ps` updated to `p[ps - 1]`. If `foundb` is true, `b` includes an additional element `maxa`. If `foundb` is false, `b` includes the element `a[pb - 1]` at the end, and `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. If `founds` is true, `s` also includes the element `(k - 1) * maxa` and `maxa`.**
