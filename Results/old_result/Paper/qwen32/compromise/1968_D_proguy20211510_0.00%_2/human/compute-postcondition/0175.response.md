The code snippet `s.append(a[ps - 1])` appends the element at index `ps - 1` of the list `a` to the list `s`. 

Given the initial state, `s` is `[-maxa]` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `s` is `[-maxa]` if `foundb` is True, otherwise `s` is the previous elements of `s`. Since the exact state of `s` is dependent on the values of `foundb` and `founds`, we consider the general case where `s` could be `[-maxa]` or a list with previous elements.

After executing the code, `s` will have an additional element, which is `a[ps - 1]`. Therefore, `s` will be `[-maxa, a[ps - 1]]` if `s` was initially `[-maxa]`, or it will be the previous elements of `s` plus `a[ps - 1]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `pb` and `ps` are integers; `p` is a list of integers; `a` is a list of integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`; `founds` is False; `foundb` is False or True; `b` is `[-maxa, maxa]` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `b` is `[-maxa, maxa]` if `foundb` is True and `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, otherwise `b` is `[maxa]` if `foundb` is True and `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, otherwise `b` is the previous elements of `b` plus `a[pb - 1]` if `foundb` is True and `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, otherwise `b` is the previous elements of `b`; `s` is `[-maxa, a[ps - 1]]` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `s` is the previous elements of `s` plus `a[ps - 1]`; `i` is `k`; `preb` is `[-maxa, 0]` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `preb` is recalculated based on the new `b` if `foundb` is True, otherwise `preb` is the previous elements of `preb`; `pres` is `[-maxa]` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `pres` is recalculated based on the new `s` if `foundb` is True, otherwise `pres` is the previous elements of `pres`; `sb` is `0` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `sb` is `maxa` if `foundb` is True and `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, otherwise `sb` is the sum of the previous elements of `b` plus `a[pb - 1]` if `foundb` is True and `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, otherwise `sb` is the sum of the previous elements of `b`; `ss` is `-maxa` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `ss` is the sum of the previous elements of `s`; `ptsb` is recalculated based on the new `preb` and `b` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `ptsb` is recalculated based on the new `preb` and `b` if `foundb` is True, otherwise `ptsb` is the previous elements of `ptsb`; `ptss` is recalculated based on the new `pres` and `s` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `ptss` is recalculated based on the new `pres` and `s` if `foundb` is True, otherwise `ptss` is the previous elements of `ptss`; `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, recalculated if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss` if `foundb` is True, otherwise `maxs` is the previous maximum value in `ptss`; `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, recalculated if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb` if `foundb` is True, otherwise `maxb` is the previous maximum value in `ptsb`; the element at index `ps - 1` in `a` is not equal to `maxa`.**
