Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0. `foundb` is false. If `founds` is true, then `s` includes an additional element `(k - 1) * maxa`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `b` or `s`.**
