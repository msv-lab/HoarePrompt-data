Postcondition: **`preb` is a list containing the elements `[sb + b[0], sb + b[0] + b[1], ..., sb + b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[len(s) - 1]]`; `pres` is a list containing the elements `[ss + s[0], ss + s[0] + s[1], ..., ss + s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[len(s) - 1]]`; `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`; `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`; `ptsb` is a list containing the elements `[preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0], preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1], ..., preb[len(s) - 1] + (k - len(s)) * b[len(s) - 1]]`; `ptss` is a list containing the elements `[pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0], pres[1] + (k - 2) * s[1], ..., pres[len(s) - 1] + (k - len(s)) * s[len(s) - 1]]`; `i` is `len(s) - 1`; `rem` is `k - len(s)`; `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`; `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`; `b` contains up to `k` elements where `maxa` is appended based on conditions; `s` contains at least one element; and `founds` is True if `maxa` was found in `s`. Additionally, if `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, then `maxs` is greater than `maxb`. Otherwise, `maxs` is either less than `maxb` or equal to `maxb`.**
