The code appends a new element to the list `ptss`. This new element is calculated as `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, the new element is `pres[2] + rem * s[2]`. The values of `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, and `rem` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` that must have at least 2 elements, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list containing the elements `preb[0] + rem * b[0]`, `preb[1] + rem * b[1]`, and `preb[2] + rem * b[2]`, `ptss` is a list containing the elements `pres[0] + rem * s[0]`, `pres[1] + rem * s[1]`, and `pres[2] + rem * s[2]`, `i` is 2, `rem` is `k - 3`.**
