Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, the length of `s` is a positive integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 1000, `s1` is an empty string, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets except for `i` if `len(alphabet) != 1`. Otherwise, `k` is 1, `s2` is the character `i`, and `alphabet` is a set containing the character 'a'.**
