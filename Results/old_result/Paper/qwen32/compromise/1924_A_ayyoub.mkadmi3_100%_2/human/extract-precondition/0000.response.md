Precondition: **s is a string consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, and the length of s is a positive integer m such that 1 <= m <= 1000. Additionally, it is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.**
