The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` represents the number of vertices in a graph and `m` represents the number of edges. It returns a list `l` of `n + 1` lists, where each list at index `x` contains all the vertices `y` that are directly connected to vertex `x` by an edge.
