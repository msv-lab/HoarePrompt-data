Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` must have at least one more adjacent vertex, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, with `vis[ver]` set to 1 and `vis[node]` set to 1, `q` contains `node`, `node` is the next unprocessed adjacent vertex in `graph[ver]`.**

In simpler terms: The vertex `node` has now been marked as visited (`vis[node]` is set to 1), and it has been added to the queue `q`. All other conditions and values remain the same as described in the initial state.
