Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` must have at least one more adjacent vertex, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, with `vis[ver]` set to 1, `vis[node]` is set to 1, `node` is the next unprocessed adjacent vertex in `graph[ver]`, and `q` now includes `node` as one of its elements.**

In simple terms, the vertex `node` has now been marked as visited by setting `vis[node]` to 1. All other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.
