The code snippet `i -= 1` decrements the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` can have one of three specific values: `len(a) - 2`, `len(a) - 3`, or `len(a) - 3` (with `j` having corresponding values `len(b) - 3`, `len(b) - 2`, or `len(b) - 3` respectively). After the decrement, `i` will take on the following new values:

- If `i` was `len(a) - 2`, it will become `len(a) - 3`.
- If `i` was `len(a) - 3`, it will become `len(a) - 4`.

The value of `j` remains unchanged. The list `l` also remains unchanged as it is not affected by the modification of `i`.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of `a[:i]` and `b[:j]`. `i` is `len(a) - 3` or `len(a) - 4` and `j` is `len(b) - 3` or `len(b) - 2` or `len(b) - 3`. `l` is either an empty list or a list containing `a[i]` or `a[i + 1]`, and in some cases, it may contain both `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`.**
