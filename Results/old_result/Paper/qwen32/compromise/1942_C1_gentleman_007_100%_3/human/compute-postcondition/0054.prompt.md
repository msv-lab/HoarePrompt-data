Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each index represents a vertex and the corresponding value is a list of adjacent vertices, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, with `vis[ver]` now specifically set to 1, and `q` is a deque object that now contains `ver` as its only element.
Code of the loop:
while len(q):
    ver = q.popleft()
    print(ver, end=' ')
    for node in graph[ver]:
        if not vis[node]:
            q.append(node)
            vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each index represents a vertex and the corresponding value is a list of adjacent vertices, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, with `vis[ver]` set to 1. All adjacent vertices of `ver` that were not visited before are now marked as visited in `vis` (i.e., `vis[node]` is 1 for all `node` in `graph[ver]` that were initially unvisited), and these vertices are added to the queue `q`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `ver` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q`, `graph` remains unchanged, `vis` has 1s for all nodes that were adjacent to `ver` and were not previously visited, and `q` has all newly visited nodes appended to it.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `ver` is the last node processed, `graph` remains unchanged, `vis` has 1s for all nodes reachable from the initial `ver` node, and `q` is empty.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
