The code snippet appends `node` to the end of the queue `q`. This affects only the queue `q`, as `node` is added to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ver` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q` before the operation, `graph` remains unchanged, `vis` has 1s for all nodes that were adjacent to `ver` and were not previously visited, `q` contains the elements that were originally in `q` excluding the first element, with `node` appended to the end, `node` is the next unprocessed node in `graph[ver]`.**

In natural language: The value of `ver` remains the same, `graph` remains unchanged, `vis` remains unchanged, `q` now includes `node` appended to the end of the queue, and `node` remains the same.
