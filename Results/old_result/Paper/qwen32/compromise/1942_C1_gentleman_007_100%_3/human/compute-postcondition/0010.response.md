Postcondition: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` must have at least one adjacent vertex, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, with `vis[ver]` set to 1. If `vis[node]` was 0 before the execution, it is now set to 1 and `q` contains `node`. Otherwise, `q` remains empty.**
