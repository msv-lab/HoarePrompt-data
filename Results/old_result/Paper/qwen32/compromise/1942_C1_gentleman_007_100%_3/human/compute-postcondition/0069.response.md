The code snippet appends `a[i]` to the list `l`. Given the initial state, `l` can either be an empty list or a list containing `a[i + 1]`. After the operation, `l` will definitely contain `a[i + 1]` followed by `a[i]`. The values of `dp`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of `a[:i]` and `b[:j]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(a)` and `j` from 0 to `len(b)`. The final value `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` contains the length of the longest common subsequence between `a` and `b`. `i` is `len(a) - 2` and must be greater than 0, `j` is `len(b) - 2` and must be greater than 0. `l` is a list containing `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`.**
