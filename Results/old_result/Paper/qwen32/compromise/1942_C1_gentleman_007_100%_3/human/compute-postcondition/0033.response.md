The code snippet `q.append(node)` adds the value of `node` to the end of the list `q`. This means that `q` now contains all its previous elements plus `node` as the new last element. The other variables `ver`, `graph`, `vis`, and `node` remain unchanged in terms of their values and conditions.

Output State: **`ver` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q` and is a valid index in `graph`; `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` must have more than one element; `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise; `node` is the next element in `graph[ver]` after the previously processed node; `q` now includes `node` as its last element.**
