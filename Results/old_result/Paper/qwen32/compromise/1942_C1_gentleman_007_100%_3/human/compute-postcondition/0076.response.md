The value of `j` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `j` could be `len(b) - 3`, `len(b) - 2`, or `len(b) - 3`, so after decrementing, `j` can be `len(b) - 4`, `len(b) - 3`, or `len(b) - 4` respectively. However, since `j` cannot be `len(b) - 4` twice, the possible values for `j` after the operation are `len(b) - 4` or `len(b) - 3`. The values of `dp`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of `a[:i]` and `b[:j]`. `i` is `len(a) - 3` or `len(a) - 4` and `j` is `len(b) - 4` or `len(b) - 3`. `l` is either an empty list or a list containing `a[i]` or `a[i + 1]`, and in some cases, it may contain both `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`.**
