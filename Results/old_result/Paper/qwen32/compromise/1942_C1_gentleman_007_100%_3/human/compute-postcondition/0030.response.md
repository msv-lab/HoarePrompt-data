The code sets the value of `vis[node]` to 1, indicating that the vertex `node` has been visited. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ver` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q` and is a valid index in `graph`. `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` must have more than one element. `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, with `vis[node]` now equal to 1. `q` has had its leftmost element removed and now includes `node` at its end. `node` is the next element in `graph[ver]`.**
