The given code snippet sets the value of `vis[ver]` to 1, indicating that the vertex `ver` has been visited. The other variables (`graph`, `q`, and any other elements in `vis`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each index represents a vertex and the corresponding value is a list of adjacent vertices, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, with `vis[ver]` now specifically set to 1, and `q` is a deque object that now contains `ver` as its only element.**
