Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of `a[:i]` and `b[:j]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(a)` and `j` from 0 to `len(b)`. The final value `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` contains the length of the longest common subsequence between `a` and `b`. `i` is `len(a) - 1` and must be greater than 0, `j` is `len(b)` and must be greater than 0, `l` is an empty list. `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`. Additionally, `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` has been decremented by 1, so `i` is now `len(a) - 1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
