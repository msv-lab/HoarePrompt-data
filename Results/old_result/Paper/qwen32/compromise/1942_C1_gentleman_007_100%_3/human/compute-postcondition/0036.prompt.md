Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ver` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q`, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each index represents a vertex and the corresponding value is a list of adjacent vertices, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, and `q` has had its leftmost element removed.
Code of the loop:
for node in graph[ver]:
    if not vis[node]:
        q.append(node)
        vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ver` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q` and is a valid index in `graph`. `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` must have at least one element. `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise. `q` has had its leftmost element removed. If `vis[node]` was 0, `q` now includes `node` as its newest element and `vis[node]` is 1. If `vis[node]` was already 1, `q` remains unchanged and `vis[node]` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ver` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q` and is a valid index in `graph`. `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` must have more than one element. `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise. If `vis[node]` was originally 0, then `vis[node]` is now 1 and `q` has had its leftmost element removed and includes `node` at its end. If `vis[node]` was originally 1, then `vis[node]` remains 1, `q` has had its leftmost element removed, and `node` is not added to `q`. `node` is the next element in `graph[ver]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ver` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q` and is a valid index in `graph`; `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` must have more than one element; `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise. If `vis[node]` was initially 0, then `vis[node]` is now 1 and `node` is added to the end of `q`. Otherwise, `vis[node]` remains unchanged and `q` is not modified.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
