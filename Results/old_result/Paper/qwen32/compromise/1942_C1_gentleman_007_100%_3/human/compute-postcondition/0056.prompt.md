You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ver is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, graph is a dictionary or list of lists where each index represents a vertex and the corresponding value is a list of adjacent vertices, and vis is a list of integers used to keep track of visited vertices such that vis[i] is 1 if vertex i has been visited and 0 otherwise.
def func_25(ver):
    q = deque()
    q.append(ver)
    vis[ver] = 1
    while len(q):
        ver = q.popleft()
        
        print(ver, end=' ')
        
        for node in graph[ver]:
            if not vis[node]:
                q.append(node)
                vis[node] = 1
        
    #State: `ver` is the last node processed, `graph` remains unchanged, `vis` has 1s for all nodes reachable from the initial `ver` node, and `q` is empty.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `ver`, which is an integer representing a vertex in the graph. It also accepts `graph`, which is a dictionary or list of lists where each index represents a vertex and the corresponding value is a list of adjacent vertices. Additionally, it accepts `vis`, which is a list of integers used to keep track of visited vertices such that `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise. The function performs a depth-first search starting from vertex `ver` and marks the visited vertices in `vis`. The function does not return a value explicitly, but it modifies the `vis` list to reflect the visited status of the vertices.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
