The code snippet `ver = q.popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the queue `q` and assigns it to the variable `ver`. This means that `ver` will now hold the value of the element that was at the front of `q`, and `q` will no longer contain that element.

Since `ver` was initially set to an integer representing a vertex in the graph and `vis[ver]` was set to 1, these conditions still hold, but the value of `ver` has been updated to the value of the element that was removed from `q`.

Output State: **`ver` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q`, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each index represents a vertex and the corresponding value is a list of adjacent vertices, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, and `q` has had its leftmost element removed.**
