Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each index represents a vertex and the corresponding value is a list of adjacent vertices, `vis` is a list of integers used to keep track of visited vertices such that `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, `q` is a deque object that now contains `ver` as its only element.**

Natural Language: The deque `q` now contains the vertex `ver` as its only element. The values of `ver`, `graph`, and `vis` remain unchanged.
