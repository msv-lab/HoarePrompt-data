### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem description to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Recap:
- We have a regular polygon with `n` sides.
- Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices.
- We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake using these `x` vertices and up to `y` additional vertices, with `y = 0` in this problem.
- The goal is to find the maximum number of triangular pieces that can be formed.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code reads the input, processes it, and computes the result as follows:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, `n`, `x`, and `y` are read.
   - The list of `x` vertices chosen by Bessie is read and sorted.

2. **Processing:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `x - 2`. This is the base number of triangles that can be formed with `x` vertices.
   - The code then iterates through the sorted list of vertices to check for consecutive vertices that are 2 positions apart (indicating a possible triangle can be formed between them).
   - If the first and last vertices in the sorted list are consecutive in the polygon (i.e., `arr[x - 1] == n - 1` and `arr[0] == 1`), it adds 1 to `ans`.
   - If the first vertex is 1 and the last vertex is `n` (i.e., `arr[x - 1] == n` and `arr[0] == 2`), it also adds 1 to `ans`.

3. **Output:**
   - The computed `ans` is printed for each test case.

#### Correctness Verification:
- The logic for counting triangles is based on the assumption that a triangle can be formed if there are three consecutive vertices in the sorted list of chosen vertices.
- The additional checks for the first and last vertices to form a triangle with the first vertex in the next cycle are correct.
- Since `y = 0`, no additional vertices can be chosen, so the logic is focused solely on the given `x` vertices.
- The provided example outputs match the expected results based on the given logic.

#### Unnecessary Functions:
- The provided code contains several functions (`func_1` to `func_25`) that are not used in the main logic of solving the problem. These functions are related to graph theory, segment trees, and other unrelated tasks, and do not contribute to the solution of the given problem.

### Conclusion:
The main logic of the provided code correctly solves the problem as described, given the constraints. The unnecessary functions do not affect the correctness of the solution.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
