You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Chamo gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Mocha doesn't like arrays containing different numbers, so Mocha decides to
use magic to change the array. Mocha can perform the following three-step
operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  1. Choose indices l and r (1 \leq l < r \leq n ) 
  2. Let x be the median^\dagger of the subarray [a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r] 
  3. Set all values a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r to x 

Suppose a=[1,2,3,4,5] initially:

  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(3,4) in the first operation, then x=3 , the array will be changed into a=[1,2,3,3,5] . 
  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(1,3) in the first operation, then x=2 , the array will be changed into a=[2,2,2,4,5] . 

Mocha will perform the operation until the array contains only the same
number. Mocha wants to know what is the maximum possible value of this number.

^\dagger The median in an array b of length m is an element that occupies
position number \lfloor \frac{m+1}{2} \rfloor after we sort the elements in
non-decreasing order. For example, the median of [3,1,4,1,5] is 3 and the
median of [5,25,20,24] is 20 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum value of the number.

Example

Input

    2
    
    2
    
    1 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 3 4 5

Output

    1
    4
    
Note

In the first test case, a=[1,2] . Mocha can only choose the interval
(l,r)=(1,2) . The array will be changed to a=[1,1] . Therefore, the answer is
1 .

In the second test case, Mocha can perform the following operations:

  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(4,5) , then a=[1,2,3,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(3,5) , then a=[1,2,4,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(1,5) , then a=[4,4,4,4,4] . 

The array contains only the same number, which is 4 . It can be proven that
the maximum value of the final number cannot be greater than 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        max = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            if min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max:
                max = min(a[i], a[i - 1])
        print(max)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates and prints the maximum value among the minimums of consecutive pairs in the list `a`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program is supposed to find the maximum possible value that the entire array can be set to using the described operations. However, the current implementation only considers the minimum value between adjacent elements and does not account for the median of any subarray.

Let's analyze the program with the provided examples:

### Example 1:
**Input:**
```
2
2
1 2
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
4
```

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
1
3
```

The program outputs `3` for the second test case instead of `4`. This is because the program only checks the minimum value between adjacent elements, which in this case is `min(1, 2)`, `min(2, 3)`, `min(3, 4)`, and `min(4, 5)`. The maximum of these minimum values is `3`, but the correct answer should be `4` because Mocha can choose the interval `(4, 5)` to set the array to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 4]`, then `(3, 5)` to set it to `[1, 2, 4, 4, 4]`, and finally `(1, 5)` to set it to `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4]`.

### Example 2:
Consider another test case:
**Input:**
```
1
3
1 3 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
1
```

Here, the program outputs `1` instead of `2`. The correct strategy would involve choosing the interval `(1, 3)` to set the array to `[2, 2, 2]` since the median of `[1, 3, 2]` is `2`.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to consider the median of any subarray and only looks at the minimum of adjacent elements, which is insufficient to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
