You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Chamo gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Mocha doesn't like arrays containing different numbers, so Mocha decides to
use magic to change the array. Mocha can perform the following three-step
operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  1. Choose indices l and r (1 \leq l < r \leq n ) 
  2. Let x be the median^\dagger of the subarray [a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r] 
  3. Set all values a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r to x 

Suppose a=[1,2,3,4,5] initially:

  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(3,4) in the first operation, then x=3 , the array will be changed into a=[1,2,3,3,5] . 
  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(1,3) in the first operation, then x=2 , the array will be changed into a=[2,2,2,4,5] . 

Mocha will perform the operation until the array contains only the same
number. Mocha wants to know what is the maximum possible value of this number.

^\dagger The median in an array b of length m is an element that occupies
position number \lfloor \frac{m+1}{2} \rfloor after we sort the elements in
non-decreasing order. For example, the median of [3,1,4,1,5] is 3 and the
median of [5,25,20,24] is 20 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum value of the number.

    1 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 3 4 5

Output

    4
    
Note

In the first test case, a=[1,2] . Mocha can only choose the interval
(l,r)=(1,2) . The array will be changed to a=[1,1] . Therefore, the answer is
1 .

In the second test case, Mocha can perform the following operations:

  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(4,5) , then a=[1,2,3,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(3,5) , then a=[1,2,4,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(1,5) , then a=[4,4,4,4,4] . 

The array contains only the same number, which is 4 . It can be proven that
the maximum value of the final number cannot be greater than 4 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the maximum possible value that all elements of the array can be set to using the specified operation. The operation allows us to select a subarray, find its median, and then replace all elements in that subarray with the median. We need to perform this operation until all elements in the array are the same, and we want this common value to be as large as possible.

### Key Insight:
To maximize the final value of all elements, we should consider how the median operation works. The median of a sorted list is the middle element if the length of the list is odd, or the smaller of the two middle elements if the length is even. Therefore, to maximize the final value, we should aim to make the largest possible element the median of some subarray.

### Strategy:
A key observation is that the largest element in the array can always be made the median of some subarray. Specifically, if we consider the subarray consisting of just the largest element, the median is the element itself. However, to ensure that the entire array can be transformed to this value, we need to check if it's possible to propagate this value throughout the array using the median operation.

### Correct Approach:
The correct approach involves finding the largest element in the array and checking if it can be made the median of a subarray that can eventually cover the entire array. However, the problem simplifies because the median operation allows us to propagate any chosen subarray's median value to the entire array through repeated applications.

### Provided Solution Analysis:
The provided solution iterates through the array and keeps track of the maximum value found among the minimums of adjacent pairs. This approach does not correctly address the problem of finding the maximum possible value that can be set for the entire array through the median operation.

### Counterexample:
Consider the array `[1, 3, 2, 4, 5]`. According to the provided solution, it would compare adjacent pairs `(1, 3)`, `(3, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and `(4, 5)`, and the maximum of the minimums of these pairs is `3`. However, the correct answer should be `5` because we can set the entire array to `5` by choosing appropriate subarrays.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as it does not account for the possibility of setting the entire array to the maximum element through the median operation.
