The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500.
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ \(10^9\).
- `_` is incremented by 1 (though `_` does not appear in the loop head, it's mentioned in the description, so we can ignore it for the purpose of adjusting the loop head variables).
- `i` is 1.
- `max` is updated based on the condition given.

From the loop statement `for i in range(1, n):`, we know that `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n`.

Since the previous iteration ended with `i` being 1, the next iteration should start with `i` being 2 (as `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration).

The variable `n` remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ \(10^9\); `i` is 2**.
