The `print('A')` statement will simply print the character 'A'. This is independent of the values of the other variables (`t`, `ac`, `bc`, `s`, and `q`) described in the initial state.

Here's the breakdown:
- The `print` statement directly outputs the string 'A'.
- The variables `t`, `ac`, `bc`, `s`, and `q` are mentioned in the initial state but do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **A**
