To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's break down the code and understand what it does.

The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. For each character, it appends a tuple to the list `prefix_balance`. This tuple contains three elements:
1. The current value of `balance` before processing the character.
2. The current index `i`.
3. The character `s[i]` itself.

After appending the tuple, the `balance` is updated:
- If the character is `'('`, `balance` is incremented by 1.
- If the character is `')'`, `balance` is decremented by 1.

Since `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, the `balance` will be 0 after processing all characters in the string. This is because every `'('` has a corresponding `')'`, and they cancel each other out.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `prefix_balance` is an empty list.
- `balance` is 0.

After the loop completes:
- `prefix_balance` will contain `n` tuples, each representing the state of `balance`, the index, and the character at that index.
- `balance` will be 0 because the sequence is balanced.

Thus, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`prefix_balance` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the balance before processing the character, the index of the character, and the character itself; `balance` is 0.**
