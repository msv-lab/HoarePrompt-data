Output State: **After all iterations, `t` is 0; `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are undefined as they are re-read in each iteration; `i` is undefined as it is a loop variable; `ans1`, `ans2`, and `ans` are the final values computed in the last iteration of the loop.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0 because it counts down to zero. The variables `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are re-initialized with new values from the input in each iteration, so they do not retain any specific value after the loop ends. The loop variable `i` is undefined outside of the loop as it is only relevant during the loop's execution. The variables `ans1`, `ans2`, and `ans` will hold the final computed values from the last iteration of the loop.
