The code sorts the array `a` in descending order. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged. The array `a` is now sorted such that the largest element is first and the smallest element is last.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n; the array `a` contains n integers sorted in descending order where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000.**
