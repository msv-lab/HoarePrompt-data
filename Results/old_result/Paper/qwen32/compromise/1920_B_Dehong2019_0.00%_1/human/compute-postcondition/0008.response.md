The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `x` is greater than 0. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1. The value of `x` remains the same as it is the loop's condition and does not change within the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n; the array `a` contains n integers sorted in descending order where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000; `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the array `a` minus `a[0] * 2`; `i` is 1, `x` must be greater than 0**
