The code snippet `ans1 += a[i]` adds the value of `a[i]` to `ans1`. 

Given the initial state, `ans1` is initially calculated as:
- `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + a[i] - a[i + x] * 4 + a[i]` if `i + x` is less than `n`, 
- otherwise `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + a[i] + a[i]`.

After the execution of `ans1 += a[i]`, `ans1` will be:
- `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + a[i] - a[i + x] * 4 + a[i] + a[i]` if `i + x` is less than `n`, 
- otherwise `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + a[i] + a[i] + a[i]`.

Simplifying the expressions, we get:
- If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` becomes `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + 2 * a[i] - a[i + x] * 4`.
- Otherwise, `ans1` becomes `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + 3 * a[i]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t-2 ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `x` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order as read from the input; `i` is `x + 1`; `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + 2 * a[i] - a[i + x] * 4` if `i + x` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + 3 * a[i]`; `ans2` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`; `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` observed during the loop; `k` is greater than 0.**
