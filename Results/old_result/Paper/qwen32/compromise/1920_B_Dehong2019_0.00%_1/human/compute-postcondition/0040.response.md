To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is just `i`. The loop iterates over the range defined by `x`, so `i` is the variable that will be adjusted for the next iteration.

Given:
- State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `x` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order as read from the input; `i` is `k`; `ans1` is `sum(a) - a[k-1] * 2 - a[i] * 2`; `ans2` is the value of `ans1` from the last iteration; `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` observed during the loop.

The loop statement:
```
for i in range(x):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Since `i` is the variable in the loop head, it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, `i` should be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

Other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `ans`) do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `x` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order as read from the input; `i` is `k + 1`; `ans1` is `sum(a) - a[k-1] * 2 - a[i] * 2`; `ans2` is the value of `ans1` from the last iteration; `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` observed during the loop.**
