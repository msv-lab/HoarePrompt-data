`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables (`n`, `k`, `x`, and the array `a`) are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n; the array `a` contains n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000.**
