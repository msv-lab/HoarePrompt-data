Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t-2 ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `x` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order as read from the input; `i` is `x-1`; `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + a[i]`; `ans2` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`; `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` observed during the loop; `k` must be greater than 0.**

Natural Language: The value of `ans1` has been updated by adding `a[i]` to it. All other variables retain their previous values.
