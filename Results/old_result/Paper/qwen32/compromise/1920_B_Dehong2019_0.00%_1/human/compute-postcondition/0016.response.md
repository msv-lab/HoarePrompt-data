Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n; the array `a` contains n integers sorted in descending order where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000; `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the array `a` minus the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` each multiplied by 2 plus `a[i]`; `i` is `x-1` if `x` > 0, otherwise `i` is 0; `ans2` is equal to `ans1`; `k` must be greater than 0; `i + x` is less than `n`.**
