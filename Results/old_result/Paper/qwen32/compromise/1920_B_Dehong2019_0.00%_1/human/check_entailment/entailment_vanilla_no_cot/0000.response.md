Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Alice's Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the sum of the array after potentially removing up to `k` elements.
   - The optimal strategy for Alice is to remove the `k` smallest elements from the array. This is because removing the smallest elements will leave the largest elements in the array, thus maximizing the sum.

2. **Bob's Optimal Strategy**:
   - Bob wants to minimize the sum of the array after potentially flipping the sign of up to `x` elements.
   - The optimal strategy for Bob is to flip the sign of the `x` smallest elements from the remaining array. This is because flipping the sign of the smallest elements will reduce the sum the most.

The provided program does not correctly implement these strategies. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Alice removes the k smallest elements
        a.sort()
        if k > 0:
            a = a[k:]
        
        # Bob flips the sign of the x smallest elements
        a.sort()
        if x > 0:
            for i in range(min(x, len(a))):
                a[i] = -a[i]
        
        # Calculate the final sum
        ans = sum(a)
        print(ans)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

In this corrected version:
- Alice first removes the `k` smallest elements.
- Then, Bob flips the sign of the `x` smallest elements from the remaining array.
- Finally, the sum of the modified array is calculated and printed.
