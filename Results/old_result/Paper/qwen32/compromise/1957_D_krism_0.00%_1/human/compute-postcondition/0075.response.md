To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable does not directly influence the output of the `print(suf)` statement.
2. **`n`**: An input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\). This determines the length of the `arr` list.
3. **`arr`**: A list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
4. **`prefix`**: A list constructed as follows:
   - The first element is 0.
   - Each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point.
   - Formally, `prefix[i] = arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ ... ^ arr[i-1]` for \(i \geq 1\).
5. **`pre`**: A list of 32 sublists, each containing `[1, 0]`.
6. **`suf`**: A list of 32 sublists, each containing `[x, y]` where:
   - `x` is the count of times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 0.
   - `y` is the count of times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 1.
   - These counts are determined by iterating over each `cur` in `prefix` from `n` down to 1 and checking all 32 bits of `cur`.
7. **`i`**: Initialized to 0.
8. **`cur`**: Initialized to `prefix[0]`, which is 0.
9. **`j`**: Initialized to 32.

### Code Execution:
The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(suf)
```

### Analysis of `suf`:
- `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each initialized to `[x, y]`.
- The values of `x` and `y` in each sublist are determined by iterating over the `prefix` list from the last element to the first (i.e., from `prefix[n]` to `prefix[0]`).
- For each `cur` in `prefix`, the 32 bits of `cur` are checked:
  - If the `j`-th bit is 0, `x` is incremented.
  - If the `j`-th bit is 1, `y` is incremented.

### Determining the Output:
- Since `prefix[0]` is 0, all 32 bits are 0.
- As we iterate from `prefix[n]` to `prefix[0]`, the counts of 0s and 1s in each bit position are updated.
- The final values of `x` and `y` in each sublist of `suf` will depend on the specific values of `arr` and the resulting `prefix` list.
- Without the specific values of `arr`, we can't determine the exact numerical values of `x` and `y` in `suf`, but we know the structure and the process by which they are calculated.

### Conclusion:
The `print(suf)` statement will output a list of 32 sublists, each containing two integers representing the counts of 0s and 1s in the corresponding bit positions across all elements in the `prefix` list.

Output: **suf (where suf is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [x, y], where x is the count of times the j-th bit was 0 and y is the count of times the j-th bit was 1 across all elements in the prefix list)**
