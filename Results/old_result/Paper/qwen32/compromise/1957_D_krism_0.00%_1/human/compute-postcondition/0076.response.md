Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn], `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [1, 0], `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist `suf[j]` is [x, y] such that x is the count of times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 0, and y is the count of times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 1, after checking all 32 bits for each `cur` in `prefix` from `n` down to 1, `i` is 0, `cur` is `prefix[0]`, `j` is 32, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. All other variables retain their previous values as the code snippet does not modify them.
