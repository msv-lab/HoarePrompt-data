Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn], `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [1, 0], `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist `suf[j]` is [x, y] such that x is the count of times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 0, and y is the count of times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 1, after checking all 32 bits for each `cur` in `prefix` from `n` down to 1, `i` is 0, `cur` is `prefix[0]`, `j` is 32.`**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all of its iterations, the `suf` list will contain the counts of how many times each bit position (from 0 to 31) was 0 or 1 across all the prefix XOR values from `prefix[n]` down to `prefix[1]`. The loop variable `i` will have reached 0, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations, and `cur` will be `prefix[0]`, which is 0. The variable `j` will be 32, indicating that all bit positions have been checked for the current `cur`. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state or as defined by the loop's logic.
