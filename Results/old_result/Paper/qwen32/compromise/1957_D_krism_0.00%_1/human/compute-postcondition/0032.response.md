Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn], `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [1, 0], `i` is `n`, `cur` is `prefix[n]`, `j` is 1. If the `j`-th bit of `cur` is 1, the 1-th sublist of `suf` is [0, 2] if it was initially [0, 1], or [1, 1] if it was initially [1, 0]. Otherwise, the 0-th sublist of `suf` remains [0, 1] if the `j`-th bit of `cur` is 1, otherwise [1, 0], and the 1-th sublist of `suf` is [2, 0].**
