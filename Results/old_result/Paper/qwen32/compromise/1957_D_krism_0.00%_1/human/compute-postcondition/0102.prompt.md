Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn], `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [1, 0], `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist `suf[j]` is [x, y] such that x is the count of times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 0, and y is the count of times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 1, after checking all 32 bits for each `cur` in `prefix` from `n` down to 1, `i` is 1, `cur` is `prefix[0]`, `j` is 32, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `c` is `prefix[1]`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(32):
    if c >> j & 1:
        pre[j][1] += 1
        suf[j][1] -= 1
    else:
        pre[j][0] += 1
        suf[j][0] -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn], `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [1, 0], except `pre[j][1]` which is 1 if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, otherwise `pre[j]` is [2, 0], `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist `suf[j]` is [x, y] such that x is the count of times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 0 and y is the count of times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 1, after checking all 32 bits for each `cur` in `prefix` from `n` down to 1, with `suf[j][1]` decremented by 1 if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, and `suf[j][0]` decremented by 1 if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 0, `i` is 1, `cur` is `prefix[0]`, `j` is 0, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, and `c` is `prefix[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn], `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [1, 0], except `pre[j][1]` which is 2 if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, otherwise `pre[j]` is [2, 1] if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1 and `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1 if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 0, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist `suf[j]` is [x, y] such that x is the count of times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 0 and y is the count of times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 1, after checking all 32 bits for each `cur` in `prefix` from `n` down to 1, with `suf[j][1]` decremented by 1 if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, and `suf[j][0]` decremented by 1 if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 0, `i` is 1, `cur` is `prefix[0]`, `j` is 1, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, and `c` is `prefix[1]`. If the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, then `suf[j][1]` has been decremented by 1. If the `j`-th bit of `c` is 0, then `pre[j][0]` has been incremented by 1 and `suf[j][0]` has been decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn], `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [1, 0], except `pre[j][1]` which is 2 if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, otherwise `pre[j]` is [2, 1] if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1 and `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1 if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 0, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist `suf[j]` is [x, y] such that x is the count of times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 0 and y is the count of times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 1, after checking all 32 bits for each `cur` in `prefix` from `n` down to 1, with `suf[j][1]` decremented by 1 if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, and `suf[j][0]` decremented by 1 if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 0, `i` is 1, `cur` is `prefix[0]`, `j` is 2, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, and `c` is `prefix[1]`. If the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1. If the `j`-th bit of `c` is 0, `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
