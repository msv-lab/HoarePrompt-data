Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of pairs of integers on the whiteboard. The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) representing the integers written on the whiteboard. The number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) is given in the first line of the input.**
