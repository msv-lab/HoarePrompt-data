The function `func_1` accepts a list of lists, where each sublist represents a test case containing `n+1` integers. The first integer `n` specifies the number of containers, and the subsequent `n` integers represent the amounts of water in these containers. The function checks if it is possible to redistribute the water in the containers such that each container has the same amount, given that the total amount of water is divisible by `n`. If the redistribution condition is met, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
