### Reasoning:

The provided program and the function `func_1` are designed to determine if it is possible to redistribute the water in the containers such that each container has the same amount, given that the total amount of water is divisible by `n`. The function follows a logical approach by calculating the mean amount of water each container should have and then checking if it is possible to achieve this mean by ensuring that the cumulative difference between the current water level and the mean is non-negative at all points.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Calculate the Mean**: The function calculates the mean amount of water each container should have by dividing the total amount of water by `n`.

2. **Check Cumulative Difference**: As it iterates through the list of water levels, the function maintains a cumulative difference (`curr`) between the current water level and the mean. If this cumulative difference becomes negative at any point, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to compensate for the deficit in the current container, making it impossible to equalize the water levels using the allowed operations (pouring water from a container `i` to a container `j` where `i < j`).

3. **Return Result**: If the cumulative difference is non-negative throughout the iteration, the function returns 'YES', indicating that it is possible to equalize the water levels. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

The function summary correctly describes the logic of `func_1`, and the original assessment incorrectly challenges the correctness of the code based on a misunderstanding of the logic. The provided code is indeed correct and handles the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
