Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect. The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed. The condition `if curr < 0:` is not sufficient to determine whether it is possible to redistribute the water such that all containers have the same amount of water. This condition only checks if at any point the cumulative difference from the mean becomes negative, but it does not account for the possibility of redistributing water from later containers to earlier ones to balance out the cumulative difference.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that at any point, the cumulative difference from the mean does not become negative because water can only be poured from an earlier container to a later one. However, the program should also ensure that the cumulative difference can be balanced out by the remaining water in the subsequent containers.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    print(func_1(nums))

def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

The above code is actually correct and should work as intended. The logic is correct because if at any point the cumulative difference from the mean becomes negative, it means there is not enough water in the previous containers to balance out the deficit, and thus it is impossible to make all containers have the same amount of water. Therefore, the initial response of the program being correct is indeed **True**. The response should be:

Correctness: **True**
