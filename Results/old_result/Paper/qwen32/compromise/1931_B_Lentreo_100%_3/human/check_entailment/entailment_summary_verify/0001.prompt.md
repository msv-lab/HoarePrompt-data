You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    print(func_1(nums))

def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    if total % n != 0:
        return 'NO'
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of lists, where each sublist represents a test case containing `n+1` integers. The first integer `n` specifies the number of containers, and the subsequent `n` integers represent the amounts of water in these containers. The function checks if it is possible to redistribute the water in the containers such that each container has the same amount, given that the total amount of water is divisible by `n`. If the redistribution condition is met, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem states that we have `n` containers, each containing `a_i` units of water. The sum of all `a_i` is divisible by `n`. We need to determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water using the operation of pouring water from a container `i` to a container `j` where `i < j`.

### Key Observations:
1. **Equal Distribution**: Since the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, there exists a target amount of water `mean = total / n` that each container should have.
2. **Operation Constraints**: Water can only be poured from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index, i.e., `i < j`.

### Solution Strategy:
To determine if it's possible to achieve the equal distribution, we can use the following approach:
- Calculate the target amount of water `mean` that each container should have.
- Traverse the containers from left to right, keeping a running total of the difference between the current water level and the target `mean`.
- If at any point the running total becomes negative, it means we've encountered a situation where we need to pour water from a container that is supposed to have less water than the target to a container that is supposed to have more water. Since we can only pour water from left to right, this situation is impossible to resolve, and we should return "NO".
- If we can traverse all containers without the running total becoming negative, it means we can achieve the equal distribution by pouring water from left to right, and we should return "YES".

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows the above strategy:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.
3. It defines a function `func_1` that:
   - Calculates the target amount of water `mean`.
   - Initializes a running total `curr` to 0.
   - Iterates through the list of water amounts, updating `curr` by adding the difference between the current water amount and `mean`.
   - If `curr` becomes negative at any point, it returns "NO".
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it returns "YES".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water using the given operation constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

Reasoning: The program correctly calculates the target water level for each container and checks if it's possible to reach this level by pouring water from left to right without encountering a situation where water needs to be poured from a container that should have less water to a container that should have more water.

Correctness: **True**
