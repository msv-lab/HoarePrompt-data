The code snippet `n = len(nums)` assigns the variable `n` the length of the outer list `nums`. This means `n` will hold the number of test cases, as each sublist in `nums` represents a test case.

Given the initial state, the length of `nums` (which is the number of test cases) is assigned to `n`. The precondition about the structure and contents of `nums` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of lists, where each sublist represents a test case and contains n+1 integers. The first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) is the number of containers, and the next n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i for each test case is divisible by n. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. `n` is the number of test cases.**
