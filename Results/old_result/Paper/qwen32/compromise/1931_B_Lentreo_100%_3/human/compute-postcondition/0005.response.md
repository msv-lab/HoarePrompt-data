Output State: **`nums` is a list of lists, where each sublist represents a test case and contains n+1 integers. The first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) is the number of containers, and the next n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i for each test case is divisible by n. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. `n` is the number of test cases. `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, and `total` is divisible by `n`. `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is: `nums` remains unchanged as a list of lists representing test cases. `n` remains the number of test cases. `total` remains the sum of all elements in `nums`. `mean` is calculated as the integer division of `total` by `n`.
