The given Python code snippet calculates the sum of all elements in the list of lists `nums` and assigns it to the variable `total`. The list `nums` contains test cases, where each test case is a sublist with the first element being the number of containers `n` and the subsequent elements being the amounts of water in those containers. The sum of water amounts for each test case is divisible by `n`.

The code does not modify the list `nums` or the variable `n`; it only calculates the total sum of all elements across all test cases and stores it in `total`.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of lists, where each sublist represents a test case and contains n+1 integers. The first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) is the number of containers, and the next n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i for each test case is divisible by n. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. `n` is the number of test cases. `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`.**
