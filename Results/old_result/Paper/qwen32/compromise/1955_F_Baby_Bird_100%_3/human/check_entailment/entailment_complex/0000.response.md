To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to understand the logic behind the problem and the provided solution.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Game Rules**: Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of the sequence of numbers is non-zero. Bob wins if the XOR is zero.
2. **Eve's Role**: Eve removes one number at a time from the sequence, aiming to maximize Bob's wins.
3. **Optimal Strategy**: Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as often as possible.

### XOR Properties

- XOR of a number with itself is zero.
- XOR of a number with zero is the number itself.
- XOR is commutative and associative.

### Analysis

For Bob to win, the XOR of the sequence must be zero. The XOR of a sequence is zero if:
- The count of each number that contributes a particular bit to the XOR is even.
- Specifically, for numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4:
  - 1 contributes to the least significant bit (LSB).
  - 2 contributes to the second least significant bit (2LSB).
  - 3 contributes to both the LSB and 2LSB.
  - 4 contributes to the third least significant bit (3LSB).

### Strategy

Eve should aim to make the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s such that the XOR becomes zero. This can be achieved by:
- Pairing numbers that contribute to the same bit positions.
- Removing numbers in a way that keeps the XOR zero for as many rounds as possible.

### Calculation

The formula used in the program:
```python
sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3
```
- `x // 2` pairs the numbers.
- `x % 2` checks if there is an unpaired number.
- `3 * (x // 2)` counts the pairs.
- `x % 2 * (i < 3)` counts the unpaired numbers for 1, 2, and 3 (but not 4).
- The sum of these values is then divided by 3 to get the number of rounds Bob can win.

### Verification

Let's verify the given examples:

1. **Example 1**: `1 1 1 0`
   - XOR of [1, 1, 1] is 1 (non-zero).
   - Eve can remove one 1, leaving [1, 1] which has XOR 0.
   - Bob wins once.

2. **Example 2**: `1 0 1 2`
   - XOR of [1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 4] is 0.
   - Eve can remove one 1 and one 3, leaving [2, 2, 4, 4] which has XOR 0.
   - Bob wins once.

3. **Example 3**: `2 2 2 0`
   - XOR of [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3] is 0.
   - Eve can remove pairs optimally to keep XOR 0 for 3 rounds.
   - Bob wins three times.

4. **Example 4**: `3 3 2 0`
   - XOR of [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3] is 0.
   - Eve can remove pairs optimally to keep XOR 0 for 3 rounds.
   - Bob wins three times.

5. **Example 5**: `0 9 9 9`
   - XOR of [2, 2, ..., 2, 3, 3, ..., 3, 4, 4, ..., 4] is 0.
   - Eve can remove pairs optimally to keep XOR 0 for 12 rounds.
   - Bob wins twelve times.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by optimally removing numbers. Thus, the program is correct.

Reasoning: The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of rounds Bob can win by optimally removing numbers to keep the XOR of the sequence zero.

Correctness: **True**
