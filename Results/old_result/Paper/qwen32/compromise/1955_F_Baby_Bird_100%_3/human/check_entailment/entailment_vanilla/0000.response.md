Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem revolves around determining the maximum number of times Bob can win in a game where Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of a sequence of integers is non-zero, and Bob wins if it is zero. Eve can remove numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

The key observation here is the behavior of the XOR operation with the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4:
- 1 in binary is `01`
- 2 in binary is `10`
- 3 in binary is `11`
- 4 in binary is `100`

The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if for each bit position, the number of 1s is even. Therefore, Bob wins if the sequence can be reduced to a set of numbers where the XOR is zero, which happens when the counts of numbers contributing 1s to each bit position are even.

### Strategy for Eve

Eve should aim to remove numbers to maximize the number of times the sequence's XOR becomes zero. The optimal strategy involves removing pairs of numbers that contribute to the XOR being non-zero, particularly focusing on the parity of the counts of each number type.

### Simplified Analysis

For each number type (1, 2, 3, 4), the strategy involves:
- For numbers 1 and 3, each contributes to the XOR in the least significant bit (LSB). To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to remove pairs of 1s and 3s.
- For numbers 2 and 4, each contributes to the second least significant bit. Similarly, Eve should aim to remove pairs of 2s and 4s.

The formula used in the program is derived from this observation:
- `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)`:
  - For each count `x` of a number type:
    - `x // 2` gives the number of pairs that can be removed.
    - `x % 2` checks if there is an unpaired number.
    - `(i < 3)` ensures that we are considering the LSB for numbers 1 and 3, and the second LSB for numbers 2 and 4.
- The sum of these values gives the total number of removals needed to maximize Bob's wins.
- Dividing by 3 accounts for the fact that each removal reduces the sequence size by one, and we need to determine how many full games (each reducing the sequence by one) can be played.

### Program Analysis

The given program implements this logic correctly:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
- It calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win using the formula.
- It prints the result for each test case.

### Conclusion

The program accurately implements the strategy to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win, given the optimal removals by Eve.
