You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains four integers p1, p2, p3, p4 (0 ≤ p1, p2, p3, p4 ≤ 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively.
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in
    enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
    #This is printed: - The result of the final calculation for each test case is converted to a string and collected into a list.
    #   - `'\n'.join(...)` joins these strings with newline characters to form the final output string.
    #
    #### Output Explanation:
    #The output of the program is a series of integers, one per line, where each integer represents the calculated value for each test case based on the given formula.
    #
    #### Final Output:
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. For each test case, it calculates a specific value based on these counts and outputs the result for each test case on a new line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem revolves around determining the maximum number of times Bob can win in a game where Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of a sequence of integers is non-zero, and Bob wins if it is zero. Eve can remove numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

The key observation here is the behavior of the XOR operation with the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4:
- 1 in binary is `01`
- 2 in binary is `10`
- 3 in binary is `11`
- 4 in binary is `100`

The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if for each bit position, the number of 1s is even. Therefore, Bob wins if the sequence can be reduced to a set of numbers where the XOR is zero, which happens when the counts of numbers contributing 1s to each bit position are even.

### Strategy for Eve

Eve should aim to remove numbers to maximize the number of times the sequence's XOR becomes zero. The optimal strategy involves removing pairs of numbers that contribute to the XOR being non-zero, particularly focusing on the parity of the counts of each number type.

### Simplified Analysis

For each number type (1, 2, 3, 4), the strategy involves:
- For numbers 1 and 3, each contributes to the XOR in the least significant bit (LSB). To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to remove pairs of 1s and 3s.
- For numbers 2 and 4, each contributes to the second least significant bit. Similarly, Eve should aim to remove pairs of 2s and 4s.

The formula used in the program is derived from this observation:
- `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)`:
  - For each count `x` of a number type:
    - `x // 2` gives the number of pairs that can be removed.
    - `x % 2` checks if there is an unpaired number.
    - `(i < 3)` ensures that we are considering the LSB for numbers 1 and 3, and the second LSB for numbers 2 and 4.
- The sum of these values gives the total number of removals needed to maximize Bob's wins.
- Dividing by 3 accounts for the fact that each removal reduces the sequence size by one, and we need to determine how many full games (each reducing the sequence by one) can be played.

### Program Analysis

The given program implements this logic correctly:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
- It calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win using the formula.
- It prints the result for each test case.

### Conclusion

The program accurately implements the strategy to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win, given the optimal removals by Eve.
