Let's break down the given Python code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
- Each of the next `t` lines contains four integers `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `p4` (0 ≤ p1, p2, p3, p4 ≤ 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively.

### Code Explanation:
The code reads `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `p4`), which represent the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. The code then calculates a value for each test case and prints these values, one per line.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation inside the loop for each test case:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The `input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into four strings representing `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `p4`.
   - `map(int, input().split())` converts these strings into integers.
   - `enumerate(map(int, input().split()))` pairs each integer with its index (0 for `p1`, 1 for `p2`, 2 for `p3`, 3 for `p4`).

2. **Calculating the Sum:**
   - For each pair `(i, x)` from the enumerated list, the expression `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)` is calculated.
     - `x // 2` gives the number of complete pairs of `x` (since each pair contributes 3 to the sum).
     - `x % 2` gives the remainder (0 or 1) after forming pairs.
     - `x % 2 * (i < 3)` ensures that if there's a remainder and the number is not a four (`i < 3`), it contributes 1 to the sum.
   - The `sum(...)` function adds up these values for all four numbers (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `p4`).

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - The result of the sum is then divided by 3 using integer division (`// 3`).

4. **Output:**
   - The result of the final calculation for each test case is converted to a string and collected into a list.
   - `'\n'.join(...)` joins these strings with newline characters to form the final output string.

### Output Explanation:
The output of the program is a series of integers, one per line, where each integer represents the calculated value for each test case based on the given formula.

### Final Output:
Output: **a series of integers, one per line, where each integer is the result of the calculation (sum of the contributions of ones, twos, threes, and fours divided by 3) for each test case**.
