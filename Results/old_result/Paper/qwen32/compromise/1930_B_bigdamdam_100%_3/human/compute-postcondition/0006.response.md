The value of `ind` is decremented by 2. Initially, `ind` is equal to `n`. After the operation, `ind` becomes `n - 2`. The values of `n` and `p` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[i]` is `n`, `ind` is equal to `n - 2`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[i]` is `n`, `ind` is equal to `n - 2`.**
