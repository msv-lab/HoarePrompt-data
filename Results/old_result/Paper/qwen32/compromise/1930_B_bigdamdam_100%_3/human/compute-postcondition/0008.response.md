Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[i]` is `ind`, `ind` is equal to `n - 2`, `i` is `n`**

Explanation: The value at `p[i]` is updated to `ind`. Since `i` is `n` and `ind` is `n - 2`, the element at index `n` in the list `p` is set to `n - 2`. All other conditions and values remain the same.
