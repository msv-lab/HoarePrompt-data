Output State: **`p` is a list where the first element is `n` and the rest are zeros, `ind` is the value of `n`, `i` is `0`, `n` must be greater than `0`.**

In simpler terms, the first element of the list `p` has been updated to the value of `n`, while the rest of the elements remain zeros. The values of `ind`, `i`, and the precondition that `n` must be greater than `0` remain unchanged.
