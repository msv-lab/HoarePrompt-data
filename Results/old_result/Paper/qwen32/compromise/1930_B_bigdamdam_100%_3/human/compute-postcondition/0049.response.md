The value of `ind` is incremented by 2. Given that `ind` was initially `5 + n % 2`, after the increment, `ind` becomes `7 + n % 2`. The other variables (`p`, `i`, `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`p` is a list where the first `floor(n/2)` even indices are filled with values `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-2*(floor(n/2)-2), ind, 0, ..., 0` with the element at index `1` replaced by `ind` and the element at index `3` also replaced by `ind`; `ind` is `7 + n % 2`; `i` is `3`; `n` must be greater than `3`.**
