Output State: **`p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[0]` is `n`, `p[2]` is `n-2`, `p[4]` is `n-4`, ..., `p[floor(n/2) * 2]` is `n - 2 * floor(n/2)`, `p[5 + n % 2]` is `3 + n % 2`, `p[7 + n % 2]` is `5 + n % 2`, and `p[j]` is `1 + n % 2` for all other `j` not specified; `ind` is `7 + n % 2`; `i` is `7 + n % 2`; `n` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The value of `ind` is incremented by 2, changing its value from `5 + n % 2` to `7 + n % 2`. The values of `p`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
