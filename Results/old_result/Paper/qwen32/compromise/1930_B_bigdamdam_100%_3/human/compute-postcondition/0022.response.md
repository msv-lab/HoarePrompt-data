The code snippet assigns the value of `ind` to `p[i]`. 

Given:
- `ind` is `5 + n % 2`
- `i` is `7 + n % 2`

Therefore, `p[7 + n % 2]` is set to `5 + n % 2`.

No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[0]` is `n`, `p[2]` is `n-2`, `p[4]` is `n-4`, ..., `p[floor(n/2) * 2]` is `n - 2 * floor(n/2)`, `p[5 + n % 2]` is `3 + n % 2`, `p[7 + n % 2]` is `5 + n % 2`, and `p[j]` is `1 + n % 2` for all other `j` not specified; `ind` is `5 + n % 2`; `i` is `7 + n % 2`; `n` must be greater than 1.**
