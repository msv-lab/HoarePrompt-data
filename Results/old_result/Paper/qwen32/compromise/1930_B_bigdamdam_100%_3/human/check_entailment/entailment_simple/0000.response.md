### Reasoning:
The program aims to generate a permutation of integers from 1 to n for each test case such that there do not exist two distinct indices i and j (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}. 

The program constructs the permutation `p` in the following manner:
1. It starts by initializing an empty list `p` of length `n`.
2. It fills the even indices of `p` with descending values starting from `n` and decrementing by 2 each time.
3. It fills the odd indices of `p` with ascending values starting from `1 + n % 2` and incrementing by 2 each time.

Let's analyze if this approach ensures that for any two indices i and j, p_i does not divide p_j and p_{i+1} does not divide p_{j+1}. 

- The even indices are filled with descending values starting from `n`, so these values are relatively large.
- The odd indices are filled with ascending values starting from `1 + n % 2`, so these values are relatively small.

Given this pattern:
- The largest possible value in the even indices is `n`, and the smallest possible value in the odd indices is `1` or `2` (depending on `n % 2`).
- The second largest possible value in the even indices is `n-2`, and the second smallest possible value in the odd indices is `3` or `4`.

This construction ensures that no value in the even indices can divide any value in the odd indices, and vice versa, because the values in the even indices are all larger than the values in the odd indices, and the gaps between values in the same sequence (even or odd) are at least 2, preventing any smaller value from dividing a larger value.

### Conclusion:
The program constructs a valid permutation that meets the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
