#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Following this, there are t lines, each containing a single integer x (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000).
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: The output consists of `t` lines, each being the value of `x - 1` from the corresponding input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer `x`, then prints `x - 1`.
