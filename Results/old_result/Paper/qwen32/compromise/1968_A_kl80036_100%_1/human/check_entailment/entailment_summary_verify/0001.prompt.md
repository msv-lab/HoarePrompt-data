You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer `x`, then prints `x - 1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads an integer \( x \). The program then sets \( y \) to \( x - 1 \) and prints \( y \). 

Let's analyze if this approach is correct based on the problem statement. The goal is to find any integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) that maximizes the expression \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

- For any \( x \), \( y = x - 1 \) is a candidate that is always valid since \( 1 \le x - 1 < x \).
- The \(\gcd(x, x-1)\) is always 1 because \( x \) and \( x-1 \) are consecutive integers and are coprime.
- So, the expression \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) becomes \( 1 + (x - 1) = x \).

Since \( x \) is the maximum possible value for \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) (because \(\gcd(x, y) \le x\) and \( y < x \)), choosing \( y = x - 1 \) ensures that the expression is maximized.

Thus, the program correctly finds a \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). Note that there might be other values of \( y \) that also achieve the same maximum value, but the program is not required to find all such \( y \), just one that satisfies the condition.

Correctness: **True**
