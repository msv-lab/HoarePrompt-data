You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Following this, there are t lines, each containing a single integer x (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000).
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: The output consists of `t` lines, each being the value of `x - 1` from the corresponding input.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program always outputs `y = x - 1` for each test case. While `y = x - 1` is a valid choice as it guarantees that `1 ≤ y < x`, it does not necessarily maximize the expression `\gcd(x, y) + y`. 

To demonstrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following test cases:

1. **Input:** `x = 10`
   - The program outputs `y = 9`.
   - Calculation: `\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10`.
   - However, a better choice is `y = 5`, where `\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10`.

2. **Input:** `x = 7`
   - The program outputs `y = 6`.
   - Calculation: `\gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7`.
   - However, a better choice is `y = 3`, where `\gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4`.

3. **Input:** `x = 21`
   - The program outputs `y = 20`.
   - Calculation: `\gcd(21, 20) + 20 = 1 + 20 = 21`.
   - However, a better choice is `y = 18`, where `\gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 3 + 18 = 21`.

In these examples, the program's output is not incorrect per se, but it does not always provide the maximum possible value of `\gcd(x, y) + y`. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to meet the problem's requirement for all potential cases.
