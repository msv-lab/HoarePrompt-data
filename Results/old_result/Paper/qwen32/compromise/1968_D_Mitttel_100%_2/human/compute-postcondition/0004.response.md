The `while` loop in the provided code will execute if the condition `not vis[s] and k > 0` is `True`. Let's break down the condition:

- `not vis[s]`: This means that the element at index `s` in the list `vis` must be `0` (since `vis` is initially a list of `n` zeros).
- `k > 0`: This means that the variable `k` must be greater than `0`.

Given the state:
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of length `n` where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive.
- `s` is a tuple containing four integers (t, n, P_B, P_S) where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the permutation, `P_B` and `P_S` are the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, and `k` is the duration of the game.
- `mx` is 0.
- `cur` is 0.
- `vis` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is 0.

Since `vis` is initialized to a list of `n` zeros, `vis[s]` will be `0` as long as `s` is a valid index in the range `[0, n-1]`. However, `s` is a tuple, not an index. We need to ensure that `vis[P_S - 1]` is `0` because `P_S` represents the starting position of Sasha, and list indices in Python are 0-based.

Given that `vis` is initialized to all zeros, `vis[P_S - 1]` will be `0` by default. Therefore, we only need to ensure that `k > 0`.

Since `k` is part of the tuple `s`, we need to ensure that the `k` value in the tuple is greater than `0`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `k` is greater than `0`.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of length `n` where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive, `s` is a tuple containing four integers (t, n, P_B, P_S) where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the permutation, `P_B` and `P_S` are the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, and `k` is greater than 0; `mx` is 0; `cur` is 0; `vis` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is 0**
