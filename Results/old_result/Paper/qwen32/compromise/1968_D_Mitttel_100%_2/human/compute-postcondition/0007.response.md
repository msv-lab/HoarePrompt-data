The code snippet `cur += a[s]` increments the variable `cur` by the value of the element at index `s` in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the new value of `cur` will be the sum of its previous value (which is 0) and `a[s]`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of length `n` where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive, `s` is a tuple containing four integers (t, n, P_B, P_S) where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the permutation, `P_B` and `P_S` are the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, `k` is greater than 0; `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `cur + k * a[s]`; `cur` is `a[s]`; `vis` is a list of `n` integers where the integer at index `P_B` is 1 and all other integers are 0.**
