To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop head: `not vis[s]` and `k > 0`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of length `n` where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive.
- `s` is `p[P_S]`.
- `k` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1.
- `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `cur + k * a[s]`.
- `cur` is `a[s]`.
- `vis` is a list of `n` integers where the integer at index `P_B` is 1 and all other integers are 0.

Let's analyze the conditions:
1. `not vis[s]`: This condition checks if the element at index `s` in the `vis` list is not visited (i.e., `vis[s]` is 0).
2. `k > 0`: This condition checks if `k` is greater than 0.

Since `k` has been decremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than 0 after the decrement. Therefore, `k` must have been at least 1 before the decrement.

For `not vis[s]` to be true, `vis[s]` must be 0. Since `vis` is a list of `n` integers where the integer at index `P_B` is 1 and all other integers are 0, `s` must not be equal to `P_B`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `k` must be at least 1 before the decrement, so `k` must be 1 or greater.
- `s` must not be equal to `P_B`.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of length `n` where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive, `s` is `p[P_S]` and `s` is not equal to `P_B`, `k` is at least 1, `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `cur + k * a[s]`, `cur` is `a[s]`, `vis` is a list of `n` integers where the integer at index `P_B` is 1 and all other integers are 0**.
