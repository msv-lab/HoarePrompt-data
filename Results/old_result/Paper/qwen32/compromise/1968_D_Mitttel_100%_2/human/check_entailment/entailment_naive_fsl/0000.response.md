Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

The program provided contains a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Let's break down the problems:

1. **Incorrect Adjustment of Indices**:
   The code adjusts the indices of the permutation and array by subtracting 1:
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       p[i] -= 1
       a[i] -= 1
   ```
   This is incorrect because the problem statement specifies that the permutation and array are 1-based, meaning they already use indices from 1 to n. Adjusting them to 0-based indexing would be correct, but the array values `a` should not be adjusted since they represent scores and are not indices.

2. **Incorrect Calculation in `func_1`**:
   The function `func_1` calculates the maximum score for a player starting from a given position `s`:
   ```python
   mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
   ```
   This line assumes that the player can stay in the current position and collect the score `a[s]` for `k` turns, which is not the case. The player can either stay or move to `p[s]` on each turn. The correct approach should consider the score collected on each turn and whether to stay or move.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Cycles**:
   The code does not correctly handle cycles in the permutation. If the player enters a cycle, they will keep collecting the score of the cycle repeatedly. The code should detect cycles and calculate the score accordingly.

4. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores**:
   The function `func_1` does not correctly compute the scores for each player over `k` turns. It should simulate the game for `k` turns, updating the scores based on whether the player stays or moves, and correctly handle cycles.

Here is a counterexample where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
3 3 1 2
3 1 2
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Draw
```

**Explanation:**
- Turn 1: Bodya is at position 1 (score: 1), Sasha is at position 2 (score: 2).
- Turn 2: Bodya moves to position 3 (score: 1 + 3 = 4), Sasha moves to position 1 (score: 2 + 1 = 3).
- Turn 3: Bodya stays at position 3 (score: 4 + 3 = 7), Sasha moves to position 3 (score: 3 + 3 = 6).

Final scores: Bodya = 7, Sasha = 6. Expected output is "Bodya", but the program might not handle this correctly due to the issues mentioned.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all potential cases, and thus the Correctness is **False**.
