### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided program and the logic behind it to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` which represent the length of the permutation, the number of turns, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - The permutation `p` and array `a` are adjusted to be 0-indexed by subtracting 1 from each element.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the maximum score a player can achieve starting from position `s` in the permutation `p` for `k` turns.
   - It initializes `mx` to 0, `cur` to 0, and a `vis` list to keep track of visited positions.
   - The function enters a loop that continues until a position is revisited or `k` turns are completed.
   - Inside the loop, it updates `vis[s]` to 1, calculates `mx` as the maximum of `mx` and `cur + k * a[s]`, adds `a[s]` to `cur`, decrements `k` by 1, and moves to the next position `p[s]`.
   - The function returns the maximum score `mx`.

3. **Comparison and Output:**
   - The program calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha using the `func_1` function.
   - It then compares the scores and prints "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on the comparison.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Handling Large `k`:** The function `func_1` correctly handles large values of `k` up to \(10^9\) by breaking out of the loop once a cycle is detected in the permutation. This is crucial because the game can get stuck in a cycle, and the function avoids unnecessary calculations.
  
- **Cycle Detection:** The `vis` list is used to detect cycles in the permutation. If a position is revisited, the loop terminates, and the function returns the maximum score encountered so far.

- **Score Calculation:** The function calculates the score correctly by considering both the immediate gain from the current position (`a[s]`) and the potential gain from remaining turns (`k * a[s]`).

- **Edge Cases:** The function handles edge cases such as:
  - When `k` is 0, the score is simply the initial position's value.
  - When a cycle is detected, the function stops and returns the maximum score encountered.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules and constraints. It efficiently handles large inputs and edge cases.

**Correctness: True**
