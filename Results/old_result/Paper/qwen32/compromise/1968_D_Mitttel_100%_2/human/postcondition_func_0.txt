The function calculates and returns the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during the traversal of a permutation `p` starting from position `s`, where `cur` is the cumulative sum of elements from `a` at visited positions, and `k` is decremented by 1 at each step until it reaches 0 or a position is revisited.
