Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s`. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers between 1 and 26, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The function returns 'YES' for each test case.**
