The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `ans`. No other variables are modified or affected by this code. Therefore, the output state will include the newly initialized list `ans` along with all other variables retaining their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input, where 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is the newly input string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets; `win` is an empty set; `ans` is an empty list.**
