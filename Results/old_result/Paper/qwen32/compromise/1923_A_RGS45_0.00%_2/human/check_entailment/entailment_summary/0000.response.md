Reasoning:  
The given program attempts to solve the problem by finding the first and last '1' in the binary string and then counting the number of '0's between them. This approach is flawed because it does not account for the fact that the chips can be moved to the closest free cell to the left, which can potentially involve moving chips beyond the first '1' in the string.

For example, consider the test case:
```
9
0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
```
The program finds the first '1' at index 1 and the last '1' at index 6, and counts the '0's between them, which results in 3. However, the optimal solution involves moving the chips at indices 2 and 7 to indices 3 and 4, respectively, resulting in only 2 moves.

The correct approach should involve calculating the number of moves required to gather all chips into a contiguous block by considering the distance each chip needs to be moved to the leftmost possible position.

Therefore, the given program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
