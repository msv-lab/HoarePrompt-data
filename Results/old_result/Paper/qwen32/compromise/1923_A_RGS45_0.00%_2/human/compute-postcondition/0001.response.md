In the provided loop, the loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable that can be adjusted is `t`. The value of `t` determines how many times the loop will execute. Since the state before the loop starts specifies that `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), this already ensures that the loop will execute at least once (when \(t \geq 1\)).

Therefore, no adjustment to the state of `t` is necessary to ensure the loop executes. The state of `n` and the list of integers `a_i` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000**
