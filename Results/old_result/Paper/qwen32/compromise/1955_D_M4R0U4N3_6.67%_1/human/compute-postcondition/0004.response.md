The given Python code snippet initializes a new empty set named `done`. This operation does not affect the values of any other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `todo`). Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `done` set which is initially empty.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, `done` is an empty set.**
