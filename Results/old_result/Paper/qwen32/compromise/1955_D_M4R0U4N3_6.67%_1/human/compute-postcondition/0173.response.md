The code `extra.remove(old)` removes the element `old` from the list `extra`. Since `old` is in `extra` by the precondition, this operation will successfully remove `old` from `extra`. The other variables (`done`, `todo`, `ans`, `m`, `n`, and `a`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`done` contains elements from `a` that were in `todo` and processed; `todo` contains elements from `a` that were in `todo` but not processed; `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo` and includes `old` except `old` has been removed; `ans` is 1 if `len(done) >= k`, otherwise `ans` is 0; `m` must be less than `n`; `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]` and `old` is not in `extra` anymore.**
