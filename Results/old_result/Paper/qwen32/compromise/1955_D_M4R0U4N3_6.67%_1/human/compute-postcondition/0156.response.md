The given code snippet adds the value of `a[j]` to the `extra` set. This means that `extra` will no longer be an empty set but will contain the element `a[j]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`done` is an empty set; `todo` contains unique integers from the input; `extra` contains the element `a[j]`; `ans` reflects the number of times `len(done) >= k`; `n` is the first input integer; `m` must be greater than 0; `k` is the third input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `j` is not adjusted before the loop starts; `a[j]` is not in `todo`.**
