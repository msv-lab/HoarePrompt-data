The code snippet adds the value of `old` to the set `todo`. Therefore, the set `todo` now contains the value of `old`. The values of `r`, `old`, and the condition that `done` no longer contains the value `old` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is `r + 2`, `old` is `a[r - m]`, `done` no longer contains the value `old`, `todo` contains the value `old`.**
