Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `todo` is a set of integers read from the input with all elements that were in `a` and `todo` removed, `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were initially in `todo`, and `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    old = a[r - m]
    if old in extra:
        extra.remove(old)
    elif old in done:
        done.remove(old)
        todo.add(old)
    if a[r] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[r])
        done.add(a[r])
    else:
        extra.add(a[r])
    if len(done) >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]` and is not an element of `extra`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. Otherwise, `a[r]` is added to `extra`. The state remains unchanged with respect to `done` and `todo` except as specified. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `r` is `r + 1` and `old` is `a[(r + 1) - m]`. If `a[r]` was in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `a[r]` was not in `todo`, `extra` includes `a[r]`. If `old` was in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. If `old` was not in `extra` and it is in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added to `todo`. Otherwise, there is no change to `done` or `todo`. If `len(done) >= k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `r` is `r + 2`, `old` is `a[r - m]`. If `a[r]` was in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. Otherwise, if `old` was in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. If `old` was in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added to `todo`. Otherwise, there is no change to `done` or `todo`. Additionally, if `a[r]` was not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`. If `len(done) >= k`, then `ans` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
