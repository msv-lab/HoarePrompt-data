The code snippet `extra.remove(old)` modifies the list `extra` by removing the element `old` from it. The values of `r` and `old` remain unchanged, but `extra` will no longer contain the element that was stored in `old`.

Output State: **`r` is `r + 1`; `old` is `a[(r + 1) - m]`; `extra` has `old` removed from it.**

In natural language, this means that the value of `r` remains `r + 1`, the value of `old` remains the element at index `(r + 1) - m` in the list `a`, and the list `extra` no longer includes the element that was stored in `old`.
