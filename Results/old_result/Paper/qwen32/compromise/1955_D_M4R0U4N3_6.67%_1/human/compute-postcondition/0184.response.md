The code snippet adds the element `a[r]` to the set `extra`. Since `a[r]` is not in `todo` (as per the initial state), this operation directly affects the `extra` set by including `a[r]` in it. The other variables (`done`, `todo`, `ans`, `m`, `n`, `old`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`done` contains elements from `a` that were in `todo` and processed, excluding `old` if `old` was in `done`. `todo` contains elements from `a` that were in `todo` but not processed, including `old` if `old` was in `done`. `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, and `extra` does not include `old` if `old` was originally in `extra`, and `extra` now includes `a[r]`. `ans` is 1 if `len(done) >= k`, otherwise `ans` is 0. `m` must be less than `n`. `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`. `a[r]` is not in `todo`.**
