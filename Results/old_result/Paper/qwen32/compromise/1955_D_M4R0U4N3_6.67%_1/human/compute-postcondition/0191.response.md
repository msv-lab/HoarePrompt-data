The code snippet `extra.remove(old)` removes the element `old` from the list `extra`. Given the initial state, `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`, and `r` has been incremented by 1. The value of `r` and the elements of `a` and `extra` are not specified, but we know that `old` is a specific element from `a` and it will be removed from `extra`.

Output State: **`r` is incremented by 1; `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`; `extra` has `old` removed from it.**
