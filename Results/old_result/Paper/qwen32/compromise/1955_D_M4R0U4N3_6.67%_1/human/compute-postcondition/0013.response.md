The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

Here's the state adjusted for the start of the next iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `j` is 1. If `a[0]` is in `todo`, then `todo` is a set of integers read from the input with `a[0]` removed, `done` is a set containing `a[0]`, and `extra` is an empty set. Otherwise, `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is a set containing `a[0]`, and `a[0]` is not in `todo`.**
