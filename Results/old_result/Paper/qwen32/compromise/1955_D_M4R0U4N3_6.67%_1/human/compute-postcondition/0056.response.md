Postcondition: **`r` is `r + 1` and `old` is `a[(r + 1) - m]`. If `a[r]` was in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `a[r]` was not in `todo`, `extra` includes `a[r]`. If `old` was in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. If `old` was not in `extra` and it is in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added to `todo`. Otherwise, there is no change to `done` or `todo`. If `len(done) >= k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
