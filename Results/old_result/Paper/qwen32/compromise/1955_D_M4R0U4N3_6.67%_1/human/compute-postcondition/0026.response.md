The provided initial state is a line of code rather than a description of variable states. However, we can infer that `old` is being assigned the value of `a[r - m]`. Since there is no additional code to execute, we can assume the operation has been performed, and `old` now holds the value of `a[r - m]`.

Given that the only operation is the assignment, the output state will reflect the new value of `old` and keep other variables unchanged. 

Output State: **`old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`**.
