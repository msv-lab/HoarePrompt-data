Output State: **`r` is incremented by 1; `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`; `done` does not contain the value of `old`; `todo` contains the value of `old`.**

Explanation: The value of `old` is added to the set `todo`. The values of `r`, `old`, and the fact that `done` does not contain the value of `old` remain unchanged.
