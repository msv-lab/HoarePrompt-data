Output State: **`done` is an empty set, `todo` is a set of integers from the input, `extra` is a set containing `a[j]`, `ans` is the count of times `len(done) >= k`, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `j` is not yet defined, and `a[j]` is not in `todo`.**

In simple terms, the `extra` set now contains the element `a[j]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
