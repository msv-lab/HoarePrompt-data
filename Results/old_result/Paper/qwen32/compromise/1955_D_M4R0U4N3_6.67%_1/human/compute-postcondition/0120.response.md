Output State: **`done` is the set of all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`, except `old` and `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`. `a[r]` is added to `done`. `extra` includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`, and remains unchanged otherwise. `n` remains unchanged. `m` is less than `n`. `k` remains unchanged. `a` remains unchanged. `old` is `a[r - m]`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 1. `r` is `m + 1`.**

In natural language: The element `old` (which is `a[r - m]`) has been removed from the set `done`. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
