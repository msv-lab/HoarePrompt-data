The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. This operation does not affect the variables `done`, `todo`, `extra`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, or `k`.

Output State: **`done` contains elements moved from `todo` and back, `todo` contains elements moved from `done` and `extra`, `extra` contains elements not in `todo` and not moved to `done`, `ans` is the count of times `len(done) >= k`, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input.**
