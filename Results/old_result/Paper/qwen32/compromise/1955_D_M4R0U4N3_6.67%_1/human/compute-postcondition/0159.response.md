Output State: **`done` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is an empty set; `todo` contains unique integers from the input except `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `todo` remains unchanged; `extra` contains the element `a[j]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` remains an empty set; `ans` reflects the number of times `len(done) >= k`; `n` is the first input integer; `m` must be greater than 0; `k` is the third input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `j` is `j + 1`; `a[j]` has been removed from `todo`.**

In simpler terms: After executing the code, `a[j]` has been removed from `todo`. The sets `done` and `extra` remain unchanged based on the initial conditions. The variable `ans` still reflects the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k`. All other variables retain their initial values.
