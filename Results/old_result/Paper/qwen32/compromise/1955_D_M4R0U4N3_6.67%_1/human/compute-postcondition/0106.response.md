Postcondition: **`done` is the set of all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo` except `old` if `old` is in `done`, otherwise `done` remains unchanged. `todo` is a set containing the element `old` if `old` is in `done`, otherwise `todo` remains empty. `extra` is the set of all elements from `a` that were not originally in `todo` except `old` if `old` is in `done`, otherwise `extra` remains unchanged. `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0. `n` remains unchanged. `m` must be less than `n`. `k` remains unchanged. `a` remains unchanged. `old` is `a[r - m]` and `old` is not in `extra`.**
