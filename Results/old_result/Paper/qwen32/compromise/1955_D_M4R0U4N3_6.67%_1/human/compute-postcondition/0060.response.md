The code snippet `done.remove(old)` removes the value of `old` from the list `done`. The values of `r` and `old` remain unchanged, but `done` will no longer contain the element that was stored in `old`.

Output State: **`r` is `r + 2`, `old` is `a[r - m]`, `done` no longer contains the value `old`.**
