The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The variables `done`, `todo`, `extra`, and `ans` are not modified by this code snippet, so they retain their initial states.

Output State: **`done` contains elements processed and in `done` after all iterations, `todo` contains elements moved from `done` to `todo`, `extra` contains elements not originally in `todo` and not moved to `done`, `ans` reflects the number of times `len(done) >= k`, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer.**
