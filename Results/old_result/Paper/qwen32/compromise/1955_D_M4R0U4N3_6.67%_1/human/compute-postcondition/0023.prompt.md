Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    if a[j] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[j])
        done.add(a[j])
    else:
        extra.add(a[j])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `j` is 0. If `a[0]` is in `todo`, then `todo` is a set of integers read from the input with `a[0]` removed, `done` is a set containing `a[0]`, and `extra` is an empty set. Otherwise, `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is a set containing `a[0]`, and `a[0]` is not in `todo`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `j` is 1. If `a[1]` is in `todo`, then `todo` is a set of integers read from the input with `a[1]` removed, `done` is a set containing `a[0]` and `a[1]` if `a[0]` was initially in `todo`, otherwise `done` is a set containing `a[1]`, and `extra` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not in `todo` initially, otherwise `extra` is an empty set. Otherwise, `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, `done` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[0]` was initially in `todo`, otherwise `done` is an empty set, `extra` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not initially in `todo`, otherwise `extra` is an empty set, and `extra` now also contains `a[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `j` is 2. If `a[j]` (which is `a[2]`) is in `todo`, then `todo` is a set of integers with `a[2]` removed, `done` is a set containing `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` if `a[0]` and `a[1]` were initially in `todo`, otherwise `done` is a set containing `a[1]` and `a[2]` if `a[1]` was in `todo`, or `done` is a set containing `a[0]` and `a[2]` if `a[0]` was in `todo`, `extra` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not in `todo` initially, otherwise `extra` is an empty set, and `extra` now also contains `a[1]` if `a[1]` was not in `todo` initially. Otherwise, `todo` is a set of integers read from the input with `a[1]` removed if it was present, `done` is a set containing `a[0]` and `a[1]` if `a[0]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is a set containing `a[1]` if `a[1]` was not in `todo`, otherwise `done` is a set containing `a[0]`, and `extra` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not in `todo` initially, otherwise it is an empty set, and `extra` now also contains `a[1]` if `a[1]` was not in `todo` initially, and `extra` now also contains `a[2]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
