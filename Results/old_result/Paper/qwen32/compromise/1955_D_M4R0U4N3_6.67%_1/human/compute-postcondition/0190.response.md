Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state:

Initial State: `r` is incremented by 1

This means that before the code snippet, `r` had some value, and now it has been increased by 1. The code snippet is:
```
old = a[r - m]
```

The variable `old` is assigned the value of the element in the list `a` at the index `r - m`. Since `r` is incremented by 1, the new value of `r` is used in the calculation of the index.

Output State: **`r` is incremented by 1; `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`.**

This means that after the execution of the code, `r` remains incremented by 1, and the variable `old` holds the value from the list `a` at the index calculated by `r - m`.
