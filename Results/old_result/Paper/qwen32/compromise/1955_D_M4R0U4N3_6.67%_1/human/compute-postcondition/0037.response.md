The code snippet `done.add(a[r])` adds the element `a[r]` to the set `done`. This means `a[r]` will now be an element of `done`. The initial state specifies that `a[r]` is not in `todo` after its removal, and `done` and `todo` remain unchanged except for this exclusion of `a[r]` from `todo`.

Given this, the updated state will have `a[r]` included in `done`, and the conditions regarding `old`, `extra`, and the state of `todo` will remain as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]` and is not an element of `extra`. If `old` is in `done`, then `old` is also in `todo`. Additionally, `a[r]` is not in `todo` after the removal and `a[r]` is now in `done`. The state remains unchanged with respect to `done` and `todo` except for the exclusion of `a[r]` from `todo` and inclusion of `a[r]` in `done`.**
