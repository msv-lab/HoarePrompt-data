The code snippet adds the element at index `j` of the list `a` to the set `done`. Given that `j` is initially 2, the element `a[2]` is added to `done`.

The initial state specifies that `done` already contains `a[0]` and `a[1]` (or a subset of these elements if they were in `todo`). After executing the code, `done` will now also include `a[2]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `j`, `todo`, and `extra`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `j` is 2, `todo` is a set of integers with `a[j]` removed, `done` is a set containing `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` if `a[0]` and `a[1]` were initially in `todo`, otherwise `done` is a set containing `a[1]` and `a[2]` if `a[1]` was in `todo`, or `done` is a set containing `a[0]` and `a[2]` if `a[0]` was in `todo`, `extra` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not in `todo` initially, otherwise `extra` is an empty set, and `extra` now also contains `a[1]` if `a[1]` was not in `todo` initially.**
