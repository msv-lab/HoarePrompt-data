The value of `old` is updated to `a[r - m]`. The value of `r` remains `r + 2` as it is not modified by the code snippet. The previous value of `old` which was `a[(r + 2) - m]` is replaced by the new value `a[r - m]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is `r + 2`, `old` is `a[r - m]`.

Output State: **`r` is `r + 2`, `old` is `a[r - m]`**
