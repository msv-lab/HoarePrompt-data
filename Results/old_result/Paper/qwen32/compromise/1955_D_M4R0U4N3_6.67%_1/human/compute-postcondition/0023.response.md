Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `todo` is a set of integers read from the input with all elements that were in `a` and `todo` removed, `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were initially in `todo`, and `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed for all `m` iterations:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged.
- The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- The list `a` remains unchanged.
- The set `todo` will no longer contain any elements that were also in `a`.
- The set `done` will contain all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`.
- The set `extra` will contain all elements from `a` that were not originally in `todo`.
