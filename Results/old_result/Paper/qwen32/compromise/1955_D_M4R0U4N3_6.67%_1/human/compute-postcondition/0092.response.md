The code snippet `done.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[j]` to the set `done`. Given that `j` is incremented by 1 before this line, `a[j]` refers to the next element in the list `a` that was not previously in `done`.

Output State: **`done` includes the element `a[j]`, `todo` is missing the element `a[j]`, `extra`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a` are defined as per the initial conditions, `j` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms: The element `a[j]` has been added to `done`, and `todo` no longer includes `a[j]`. All other variables remain as they were defined initially, with `j` having been incremented by 1.
