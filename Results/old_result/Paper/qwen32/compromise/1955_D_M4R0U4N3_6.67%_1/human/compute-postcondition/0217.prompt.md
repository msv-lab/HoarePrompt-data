Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. a is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. b is a list of m integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    todo = set(map(int, input().split()))
    done = set()
    extra = set()
    for j in range(m):
        if a[j] in todo:
            todo.remove(a[j])
            done.add(a[j])
        else:
            extra.add(a[j])
    ans = 1 if len(done) >= k else 0
    for r in range(m, n):
        old = a[r - m]
        if old in extra:
            extra.remove(old)
        elif old in done:
            done.remove(old)
            todo.add(old)
        if a[r] in todo:
            todo.remove(a[r])
            done.add(a[r])
        else:
            extra.add(a[r])
        if len(done) >= k:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `done` contains elements moved from `todo` and back, `todo` contains elements moved from `done` and `extra`, `extra` contains elements not in `todo` and not moved to `done`, `ans` is the count of times `len(done) >= k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `done` contains elements processed and in `done` after all iterations, `todo` contains elements moved from `done` to `todo`, `extra` contains elements not originally in `todo` and not moved to `done`, `ans` reflects the number of times `len(done) >= k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `done` contains elements from `a` that were in `todo` and processed, `todo` contains elements from `a` that were in `todo` but not processed, `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `len(done) >= k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
