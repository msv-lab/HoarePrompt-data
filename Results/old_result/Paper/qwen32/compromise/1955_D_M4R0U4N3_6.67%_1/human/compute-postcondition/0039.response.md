The provided code snippet adds the value of `a[r]` to the set `extra`. The initial state specifies that `a[r]` is not in `todo`, and `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]` and is not an element of `extra`. The state of `done` and `todo` remains unchanged unless `old` is in `done`, in which case `old` is also in `todo`.

Since the code only modifies `extra` by adding `a[r]` to it, the other variables (`old`, `a[r - m]`, `done`, `todo`) remain unchanged. The only change is that `a[r]` is now an element of `extra`.

Output State: **`old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]` and is not an element of `extra`; `a[r]` is added to `extra`; `done` and `todo` remain unchanged.**
