The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. Since the loop iterates over the range of `int(input())`, the loop will execute if and only if `int(input())` is greater than 0. The variable `t` represents the number of test cases and is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `int(input())` should be equal to `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `int(input())` must be equal to `t`**
