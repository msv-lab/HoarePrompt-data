### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine if the program correctly decodes the encoded string as per the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
1. **Encoding Process**:
   - Construct a string `r` consisting of distinct letters of `s` in alphabetical order.
   - Replace each character in `s` with its symmetric character from `r`.

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - Reverse the above process to get back the original string `s` from the encoded string `b`.

#### Analysis of Provided Program:
The provided program attempts to decode the string `b` by creating a mapping from each character in `b` to a unique character from 'a' to 'z'. However, it does not follow the symmetric character replacement strategy described in the problem statement.

Here is the annotated breakdown of the program:

```python
def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    mapping = {}
    decoded = []
    for char in encoded:
        if char in mapping:
            decoded.append(mapping[char])
        else:
            for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
                if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                    mapping[chr(c)] = char
                    break
            decoded.append(chr(c))
    return ''.join(decoded)
```

- **Mapping Construction**:
  - The program iterates over each character in the encoded string `b`.
  - If the character is already in the mapping, it appends the corresponding mapped character to `decoded`.
  - If the character is not in the mapping, it finds the first available character from 'a' to 'z' that is not already a value in the mapping and assigns it to the current character in `b`.

- **Symmetric Character Replacement**:
  - The program does not compute the string `r` (distinct characters of `s` sorted alphabetically).
  - It does not perform the symmetric character replacement as described in the problem statement.

#### Example Walkthrough:
Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:
- Encoded string `b = "serofedsoc"`.
- Distinct characters in alphabetical order: `r = "cdefors"`.
- Symmetric mapping:
  - 's' -> 'c'
  - 'e' -> 'd'
  - 'r' -> 'o'
  - 'o' -> 'f'
  - 'f' -> 'e'
  - 'd' -> 'r'
  - 'c' -> 's'
- Decoded string `s = "codeforces"`.

The provided program does not perform this symmetric mapping and instead assigns the first available character from 'a' to 'z' to each new character in `b`.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly decode the encoded string as it does not follow the symmetric character replacement strategy described in the problem statement. The original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
