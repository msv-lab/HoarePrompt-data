The code snippet `mapping[chr(c)] = char` updates the `mapping` dictionary by adding a new key-value pair where the key is the character representation of the integer `c` and the value is the variable `char`. 

Given the initial state, `char` is `char_next_next` and `c` is `c + 1`. Therefore, after the execution of the code, the `mapping` dictionary will have a new entry with the key as `chr(c)` and the value as `char_next_next`.

The values of other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `mapping` is a dictionary that maps characters from `encoded` to `decoded` with an additional entry `chr(c): char_next_next`, `decoded` is a list of characters, `char` is `char_next_next`, `c` is `c + 1`**.
