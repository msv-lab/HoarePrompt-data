Postcondition: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. If `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, then `mapping` is a dictionary with one key-value pair `{chr(c): char}`, and `decoded` remains an empty list. If `chr(c)` is in `mapping.values()`, then `mapping` and `decoded` remain unchanged.**
