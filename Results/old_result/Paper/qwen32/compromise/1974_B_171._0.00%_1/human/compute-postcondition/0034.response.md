The code snippet `mapping[chr(c)] = char` updates the `mapping` dictionary by assigning the value of `char` to the key `chr(c)`. Given that `c` is 99, `chr(c)` corresponds to the character 'c'. Therefore, the key 'c' in the `mapping` dictionary is now mapped to the value of `char`.

Given the initial state, `mapping` was either `{'a': char}` or `{'b': char_next}`. After the code execution, `mapping` will be updated to include the key 'c' mapped to `char`. The values of `encoded`, `c`, `decoded`, and `char` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `c` is 99, `mapping` is either `{'a': char, 'c': char}` or `{'b': char_next, 'c': char}`, `decoded` is a list containing `chr(c)`, `char` is `char_next`**.
