The code snippet `mapping[chr(c)] = char` updates the dictionary `mapping` by adding a new key-value pair where the key is `chr(c)` and the value is `char`. Given the initial state, `c` is 98, so `chr(c)` is 'b'. Therefore, the dictionary `mapping` will now include the entry `{'b': char}`. Since `char` is `char_next` and `char_next` is not defined in the initial state, we will represent it as `char_next` in the output state. The other variables (`encoded`, `decoded`, `char`, and `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `mapping` is `{'a': char}` or `{'b': char_next}`; `decoded` is a list containing `chr(c)`; `char` is `char_next`; and `c` is 98.**
