The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables; it only terminates the most internal loop or if statement it is placed in. Therefore, the values of `encoded`, `mapping`, `decoded`, `char`, `char_next`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `mapping` is `{'a': char}` or `{'b': char_next}`; `decoded` is a list containing `chr(c)`; `char` is `char_next`; and `c` is 98.**
