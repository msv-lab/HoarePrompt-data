Postcondition: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `mapping` is a dictionary that maps characters from `encoded` to `decoded`. If `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` is updated with an additional entry `chr(c): char_next_next`, `decoded` remains a list of characters, `char` is set to `char_next_next`, and `c` is incremented by 1. If `chr(c)` is already in `mapping.values()`, no changes are made to `mapping`, `decoded`, `char`, or `c`.**
