The code snippet assigns a new key-value pair to the `mapping` dictionary where the key is `chr(c)` and the value is `char`. This operation modifies the `mapping` dictionary but does not affect the `encoded` string, `decoded` list, or the value of `c` itself, as `c` is incremented outside the provided code snippet.

Given the initial state, the output state will reflect the updated `mapping` dictionary with the new key-value pair added. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `mapping` is a dictionary with an additional key-value pair `{chr(c): char}`; `decoded` remains an empty list; `c` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration.**
