You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The function will be called multiple times (up to 10^4 times) with different strings, but the total length of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1(encoded):
    mapping = {}
    decoded = []
    for char in encoded:
        if char in mapping:
            decoded.append(mapping[char])
        else:
            for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
                if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                    mapping[chr(c)] = char
                    break
            decoded.append(chr(c))
        
    #State: - After processing all characters in `encoded`, `decoded` will contain a transformed version of `encoded` where each unique character in `encoded` is mapped to a unique character from 'a' to 'z'.
    #   - `mapping` will contain a mapping of each unique character in `encoded` to a unique character from 'a' to 'z'.
    #   - `encoded` remains unchanged.
    #
    #Given this understanding, the final output state is:
    #
    #Output State:
    return ''.join(decoded)
    #The program returns the decoded string which is a transformed version of `encoded` where each unique character in `encoded` is mapped to a unique character from 'a' to 'z'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `encoded`, which is a string of lowercase Latin letters. It returns the decoded string, where each unique character in `encoded` is mapped to a unique character from 'a' to 'z'.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the decoded string which is a transformed version of `encoded` where each unique character in `encoded` is mapped to a unique character from 'a' to 'z'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
