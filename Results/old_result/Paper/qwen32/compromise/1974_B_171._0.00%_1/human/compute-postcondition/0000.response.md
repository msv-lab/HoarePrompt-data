The code snippet provided initializes an empty dictionary named `mapping`. This action does not affect the `encoded` string or its length `n`, which remain unchanged. The only new element introduced is the `mapping` dictionary, which starts as empty.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` satisfies 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `mapping` is an empty dictionary.**
