To determine the final state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop iterates over each character from 'a' to 'z' and checks if the character is already a value in the `mapping` dictionary. If not, it adds an entry to `mapping` and breaks out of the loop. Given that the loop only breaks after finding the first character that is not a value in `mapping`, it will run at most 26 times (once for each letter of the alphabet).

Given the information about the first three iterations, we can infer the following:
1. After the first iteration, the character 'a' was either already in `mapping.values()` or was added to `mapping` with the value `char`.
2. After the second iteration, the character 'b' was either already in `mapping.values()` or was added to `mapping` with the value `char`.
3. After the third iteration, the character 'y' was either already in `mapping.values()` or was added to `mapping` with the value `char`.

Since the loop breaks after finding the first character that is not in `mapping.values()`, and it ran for three iterations, it means that 'a', 'b', and 'y' were all already in `mapping.values()` up to the point where 'y' was checked. This implies that the loop would continue until it found a character that was not in `mapping.values()`. Since the loop iterates from 'a' to 'z', the loop will terminate when it finds the first character from 'a' to 'z' that is not a value in `mapping`.

If `mapping` initially contains only one entry `{'a': char}`, then the loop will check 'a' and find that it is already in `mapping.values()`. It will then check 'b', and if 'b' is also in `mapping.values()`, it will continue until it finds a character that is not in `mapping.values()`. The loop will stop as soon as it finds such a character, adding it to `mapping` and breaking out of the loop.

Given the constraints and the behavior of the loop, the final state will be when the loop finds the first character from 'a' to 'z' that is not in `mapping.values()`, adds it to `mapping`, and breaks out of the loop.

Let's assume the initial state is `mapping = {'a': char}`. The loop will check 'a', find it in `mapping.values()`, then check 'b', and so on, until it finds a character that is not in `mapping.values()`. Since 'a' is already in `mapping.values()`, the loop will check 'b', 'c', ..., and so on, until it finds the first character that is not in `mapping.values()`. If all characters from 'a' to 'z' are in `mapping.values()`, the loop will not break, but since the problem states that the loop breaks after three iterations, it means that there is at least one character from 'a' to 'z' that is not in `mapping.values()`.

Let's assume the loop breaks after finding 'z' is not in `mapping.values()`. The final state will be:
- `mapping` will contain an additional entry `{'z': char_next_next}`.
- `decoded` will remain a list of characters.
- `char` will be set to `char_next_next`.
- The loop will have iterated through all characters from 'a' to 'z'.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the final state will be:
- `mapping` will contain all characters from 'a' to 'z' as values, with the last character added being 'z' with the value `char_next_next`.
- `decoded` will remain unchanged as a list of characters.
- `char` will be set to `char_next_next`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`mapping` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' as values, with the last character added being 'z' with the value `char_next_next`, and `decoded` remains unchanged as a list of characters.**
