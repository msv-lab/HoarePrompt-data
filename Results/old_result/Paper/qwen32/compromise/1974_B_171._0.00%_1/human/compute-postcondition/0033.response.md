The only variable in the loop head is `c`, which iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`. This means `c` will take on integer values starting from 97 (which is `ord('a')`) up to 122 (which is `ord('z')`).

At the end of the previous iteration, `c` was 98. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be incremented by 1, so `c` should be 99, which corresponds to the character 'c'.

The other variables (`encoded`, `n`, `mapping`, `decoded`, `char`, and `char_next`) are not part of the loop head, so they should remain unchanged.

State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `c` is 99, `mapping` is either `{'a': char}` or `{'b': char_next}`, `decoded` is a list containing `chr(c)`, `char` is `char_next`**
