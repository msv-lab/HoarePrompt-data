#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The function will be called multiple times (up to 10^4 times) with different strings, but the total length of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1(encoded):
    mapping = {}
    decoded = []
    for char in encoded:
        if char in mapping:
            decoded.append(mapping[char])
        else:
            for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
                if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                    mapping[chr(c)] = char
                    break
            decoded.append(chr(c))
        
    #State: - After processing all characters in `encoded`, `decoded` will contain a transformed version of `encoded` where each unique character in `encoded` is mapped to a unique character from 'a' to 'z'.
    #   - `mapping` will contain a mapping of each unique character in `encoded` to a unique character from 'a' to 'z'.
    #   - `encoded` remains unchanged.
    #
    #Given this understanding, the final output state is:
    #
    #Output State:
    return ''.join(decoded)
    #The program returns the decoded string which is a transformed version of `encoded` where each unique character in `encoded` is mapped to a unique character from 'a' to 'z'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string where each unique character in `encoded` is replaced by a unique character from 'a' to 'z'. The original `encoded` string remains unchanged.
