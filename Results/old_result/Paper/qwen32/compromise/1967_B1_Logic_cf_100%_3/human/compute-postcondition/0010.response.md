To determine the new state after executing the given code, let's analyze the changes step-by-step:

The code snippet modifies the variable `ans` by adding the result of the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` to it. Here, `b` is updated from its original value to `b + 1` before the expression is evaluated.

Given:
- `t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `m` must be at least 2.
- `b` is initially `b + 1`.

Let's denote the original value of `b` as `b_original`. After the line `b = b + 1` is executed, `b` becomes `b_original + 1`.

The expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` is evaluated using the updated value of `b`, which is `b_original + 1`. Thus, the expression becomes `(n + (b_original + 1)) // ((b_original + 1) * (b_original + 1))`.

After evaluating this expression, the result is added to `ans`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `t` remains an input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `n` remains at least 2.
- `m` remains at least 2.
- `b` is now `b_original + 1`.
- `ans` is updated to `ans + (n + (b_original + 1)) // ((b_original + 1) * (b_original + 1))`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `b` is `b + 1`, `ans` is `ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`**
