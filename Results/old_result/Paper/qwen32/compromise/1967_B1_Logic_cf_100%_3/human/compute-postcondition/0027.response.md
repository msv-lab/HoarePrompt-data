The code snippet `[n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]` converts the values of `n` and `m` from their current form (which could be strings or any other type) to integers. This conversion does not affect the other variables (`t`, `ans`, `T`) as they are not modified by this line of code.

Since `n` and `m` are now explicitly converted to integers, the output state reflects this change while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` is the first number from the new input converted to an integer, `m` is the second number from the new input converted to an integer, `ans` is `n + Î£((n + b) // (b * b))` for `b` ranging from 2 to `min(n, m)`, `T` is `T + 1`.**
