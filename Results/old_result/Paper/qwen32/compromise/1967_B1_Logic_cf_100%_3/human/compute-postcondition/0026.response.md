The given code snippet reads two space-separated values from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. This changes the values of `n` and `m` from their initial state to the new input values.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` is the first number from the new input, `m` is the second number from the new input, `ans` is `n + Î£((n + b) // (b * b))` for `b` ranging from 2 to `min(n, m)`, `T` is `T + 1`.**
This means that `n` and `m` now hold the values provided by the new input, while `t`, `ans`, and `T` retain their previous values or expressions, except `T` which is incremented by 1.
