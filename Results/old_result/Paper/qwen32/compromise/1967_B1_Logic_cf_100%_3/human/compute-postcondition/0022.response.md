Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `b` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `ans` is updated to `ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its current value. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `b` remain as they were initially described, except `b` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value.
