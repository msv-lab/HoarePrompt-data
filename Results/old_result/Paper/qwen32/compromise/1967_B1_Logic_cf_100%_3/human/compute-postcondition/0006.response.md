To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

Initial State: `t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `ans` is equal to `n`.

Code Snippet:
```python
ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
```

The code modifies the variable `ans`. The new value of `ans` is calculated as its old value plus the integer division of `(n + b)` by `(b * b)`. However, the variable `b` is not defined in the initial state or in the provided code snippet. Therefore, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans` without knowing `b`.

Given the constraints and the operation performed, we can express the new value of `ans` in terms of `n` and `b`:

New value of `ans` = `n` + `(n + b) // (b * b)`

Since `b` is not specified, we leave the expression as it is.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`**.
