To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `b`, `n`, and `m`.

Given:
- The loop iterates over `b` from 2 to `min(n, m) + 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `b` has taken some value, and we need to adjust it for the next iteration.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **Variable `b`:**
   - Since `b` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `b` should be `b + 1`.

2. **Variables `n` and `m`:**
   - These variables do not change within the loop based on the given information. Therefore, they remain the same.

3. **Other Variables (`t`, `ans`, `T`):**
   - These variables are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted according to the loop's control flow.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `m` must be at least 2.
- `ans` is `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`.
- `T` is `T + 1`.

We need to adjust `b` for the next iteration:
- If `b` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it should be 3 at the start of the next iteration.
- This pattern continues until `b` reaches `min(n, m) + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `b` is `b + 1`, `ans` is `n + (n + b + 1) // ((b + 1) * (b + 1))`, `T` is `T + 1`**

However, since we are only adjusting the variables in the loop head, the final adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `b` is `b + 1`**
