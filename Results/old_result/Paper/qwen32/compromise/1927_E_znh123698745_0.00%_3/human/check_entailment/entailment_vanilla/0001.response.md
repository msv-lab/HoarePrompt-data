Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly constructs a k-level permutation for the given problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a list `array` containing numbers from 1 to n.
   - It also initializes `answer` with the first element as 1.
   - It initializes `a` with the values [1, -1].

2. **Building the Permutation**:
   - For each subsequent element in the permutation (from index 1 to n-1), the program alternates between taking the next smallest available number and the next largest available number.
   - Specifically, if the index `i` is odd, it takes the next largest available number (from the end of `array`).
   - If the index `i` is even, it takes the next smallest available number (from the start of `array`).

3. **Checking k-Level Condition**:
   - The constructed permutation alternates between taking the smallest and largest available numbers, which is not necessarily the correct approach to ensure the k-level condition.
   - The k-level condition requires that the sums of any k consecutive elements in the permutation should differ by no more than 1.
   - The given program does not guarantee this condition. For example, in the test case `n=10, k=4`, the program might produce a permutation where the sums of k consecutive elements vary more than 1.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the test case `n=10, k=4`:
- The program might produce a permutation like `1 10 2 9 3 8 4 7 5 6`.
- The sums of k=4 consecutive elements are: `1+10+2+9=22`, `10+2+9+3=24`, `2+9+3+8=22`, `9+3+8+4=24`, `3+8+4+7=22`, `8+4+7+5=24`, `4+7+5+6=22`.
- Here, the maximum sum is 24 and the minimum sum is 22, which satisfies the k-level condition. However, this is not guaranteed by the provided code for all cases.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not guarantee the k-level condition for all test cases. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
