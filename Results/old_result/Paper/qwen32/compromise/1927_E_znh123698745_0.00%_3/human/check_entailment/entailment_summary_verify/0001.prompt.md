You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        array = list(range(1, n + 1))
        answer = [1]
        a = [1, -1]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if (-1) ** i == -1:
                answer.append(array[a[-1]])
                a[-1] -= 1
            else:
                answer.append(array[a[0]])
                a[0] += 1
        print(*answer)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple pairs of integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. For each pair, it generates and prints a specific permutation of the numbers from 1 to `n`. The permutation alternates between the smallest and largest remaining numbers, starting with 1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly constructs a k-level permutation for the given problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a list `array` containing numbers from 1 to n.
   - It also initializes `answer` with the first element as 1.
   - It initializes `a` with the values [1, -1].

2. **Building the Permutation**:
   - For each subsequent element in the permutation (from index 1 to n-1), the program alternates between taking the next smallest available number and the next largest available number.
   - Specifically, if the index `i` is odd, it takes the next largest available number (from the end of `array`).
   - If the index `i` is even, it takes the next smallest available number (from the start of `array`).

3. **Checking k-Level Condition**:
   - The constructed permutation alternates between taking the smallest and largest available numbers, which is not necessarily the correct approach to ensure the k-level condition.
   - The k-level condition requires that the sums of any k consecutive elements in the permutation should differ by no more than 1.
   - The given program does not guarantee this condition. For example, in the test case `n=10, k=4`, the program might produce a permutation where the sums of k consecutive elements vary more than 1.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the test case `n=10, k=4`:
- The program might produce a permutation like `1 10 2 9 3 8 4 7 5 6`.
- The sums of k=4 consecutive elements are: `1+10+2+9=22`, `10+2+9+3=24`, `2+9+3+8=22`, `9+3+8+4=24`, `3+8+4+7=22`, `8+4+7+5=24`, `4+7+5+6=22`.
- Here, the maximum sum is 24 and the minimum sum is 22, which satisfies the k-level condition. However, this is not guaranteed by the provided code for all cases.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not guarantee the k-level condition for all test cases. Therefore, it is incorrect.
