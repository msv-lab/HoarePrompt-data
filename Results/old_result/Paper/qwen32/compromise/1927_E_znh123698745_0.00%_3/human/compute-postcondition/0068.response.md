The code appends the element at the index specified by the last element of the list `a` from the list `array` to the list `answer`. 

Given that `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, and `a[-1]` is the last element of `a`, the value appended to `answer` will be `array[a[-1]]`. Since `a[-1]` is an index, it must be a valid index within the range of `array`, which is from 0 to `n-1`.

Therefore, the element at `array[a[-1]]` will be an integer between 1 and `n`.

Output State: **the number of remaining iterations is `iterations - 1`; `n` is greater than `iterations`; `k` are integers read from input; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `answer` has an additional element which is `array[a[-1]]`.**
