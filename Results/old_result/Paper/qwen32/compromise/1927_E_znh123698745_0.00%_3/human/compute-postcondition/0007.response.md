The code snippet appends the element of `array` at the index specified by the last element of `a` to the `answer` list. Given the initial state, `a` is `[1, -1]`, so the last element of `a` is `-1`. However, since `-1` is an invalid index for `array` (as indices for a list of length `n` are from `0` to `n-1`), this operation would typically raise an `IndexError`. But, for the sake of this exercise, we will assume the code handles this edge case gracefully or the context allows for such an operation (e.g., a hypothetical language or environment).

If we strictly follow the given code and assume no error handling, `answer` will have an additional element which is `array[-1]`. Since `array` is a list of integers from `1` to `n`, `array[-1]` is `n`.

Thus, `answer` will be `[1, n]`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `answer` is [1, n]; `a` is [1, -1]; `i` is an integer such that `(-1)`**
