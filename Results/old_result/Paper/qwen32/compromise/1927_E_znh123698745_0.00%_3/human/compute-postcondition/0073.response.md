Let's analyze the given task step by step:

The loop given is:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop iterates over the range starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- The number of remaining iterations is `iterations - 1`.
- `n` is greater than `iterations`.
- `k` are integers read from input.
- `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the loop variable `i` and ensure that the loop can still execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Variable Adjustment**:
    - At the end of the previous iteration, the loop variable `i` would have been used in the loop body.
    - According to the loop definition, `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration.
    - If at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `iterations`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `iterations + 1`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
    - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
    - Given that `n` is greater than `iterations`, and `i` is now `iterations + 1`, the loop will execute if `iterations + 1 < n`.

### Adjusted State:
- The number of remaining iterations is now `iterations - 2` (since one more iteration is about to start).
- `n` remains greater than `iterations + 1`.
- `k` and `array` do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

### Final State:
State: **The number of remaining iterations is `iterations - 2`; `n` is greater than `iterations + 1`; `k` are integers read from input; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `i` is `iterations + 1`**.
