Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `i` is `n-1`. If `i` is odd (which it is, since `i` is `n-1` and `n` is at least 2), `answer` contains the element `n`. Otherwise, `answer` contains the element at index `a[0]` of `array`, and `a[0]` has been incremented by 1.**

Given the precondition that `i` is `n-1` and `n` is at least 2, `i` will always be odd, meaning the if condition `(-1) ** i == -1` will always be true. Therefore, the else part will never execute. The overall postcondition simplifies to the state described in the if part.
