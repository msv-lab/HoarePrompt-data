The code snippet `a = [1, -1]` changes the value of the variable `a` to `[1, -1]`. The values of the other variables (`answer`, `n`, `k`, and `array`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`answer` is [1]; `a` is [1, -1]; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.**
