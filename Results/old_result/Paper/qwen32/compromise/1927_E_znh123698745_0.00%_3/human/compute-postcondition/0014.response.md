The code snippet provided appends the last element of the `array` to the `answer` list. Given the initial state, `i` is `n-1`, but `i` is not used in the provided code snippet. The last element of `array` is `array[n-1]`, which is `n` because `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `i` is `n-1`; `answer` contains the element `n`.**
