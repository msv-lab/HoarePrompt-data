Postcondition: **The number of remaining iterations is `iterations - 1`; `n` is greater than `iterations`; `k` are integers read from input; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. If `(-1) ** i == -1`, then `answer` has an additional element which is `array[a[-1]]` and the last element of `a` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `answer` contains the element at index `a[0]` from `array` and `a[0]` is incremented by 1.**
