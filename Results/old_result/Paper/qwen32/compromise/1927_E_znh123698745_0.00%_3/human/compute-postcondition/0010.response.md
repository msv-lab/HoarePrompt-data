The code snippet appends the element at the index specified by `a[0]` in the `array` to the `answer` list. Given that `a[0]` is 1, the element at index 1 in the `array` (which is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive) is 2 (since indexing starts at 0).

Therefore, the `answer` list, which was initially `[1]`, will now be `[1, 2]`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `answer` is [1, 2]; `a` is [1, -1]; `i` is an integer for which `(-1)`**
