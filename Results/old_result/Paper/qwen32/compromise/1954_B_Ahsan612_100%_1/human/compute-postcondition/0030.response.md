The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `same`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements, `i` is 5, `num` is `ar[5]`, `minn` is the minimum of its initial value and `same`, `same` is 1.**
