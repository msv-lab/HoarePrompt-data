The variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `len(ar)`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 3, 4, or 5. Since `ar` is a new list of integers with at least 4 elements, `len(ar)` is at least 4. 

- If `i` is 3, the loop can execute again because 3 is less than `len(ar)`.
- If `i` is 4, the loop can execute again because 4 is less than `len(ar)`.
- If `i` is 5, the loop can execute again only if `len(ar)` is greater than 5.

To ensure that the loop can certainly execute one more time, we need to make sure that `i` is less than `len(ar)`. Since `i` is currently 3, 4, or 5, we need to ensure that `len(ar)` is at least 6. This will guarantee that the loop can execute one more time regardless of the current value of `i`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers with at least 6 elements. If `ar[i]` was equal to `num`, then `i` is 3, `same` is 3, and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, `i` is 4 if `ar[i]` was equal to `num` otherwise `i` is 5, `num` is `ar[3]` if `i` was 3 otherwise `ar[4]`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is 2 if `i` was 3 otherwise `minn` is 1**
