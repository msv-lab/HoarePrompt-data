Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements. If `ar[4]` equals `num`, then `i` becomes 5, `num` remains either `ar[2]` or `ar[3]`, `minn` is either 1 or the minimum of 1 and `ar[3]`, and `same` is either 2 or increased by 1. Otherwise, `i` becomes 6, `num` becomes `ar[5]`, `minn` is updated to the minimum of its initial value and `same`, and `same` is reset to 1.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. If `ar[4]` equals `num`, `i` was 4 and is now 5. If `ar[4]` does not equal `num`, `i` was 5 and is now 6. The values of `num`, `minn`, and `same` remain as described in the initial state unless `ar[4]` equals `num`, in which case `same` could be increased by 1.
