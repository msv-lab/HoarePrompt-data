To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop statement. The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`. This means that for the loop to execute again, the value of `i` must be less than the length of the list `ar`.

Given the information:
- `t` is greater than 0 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `n` is an input integer (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements
- `i` is either 3 or 4
- `num` is either `ar[2]` or `ar[3]` (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `minn` is either 1 or the minimum of 1 and `ar[3]` (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `same` is either 1 or increased by 1 (not relevant to the loop condition)

The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `i`. Since `ar` has at least 3 elements, `len(ar)` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`. Given that `i` is either 3 or 4, if `i` is 4, it must be adjusted to be less than `len(ar)`.

If `i` is 3, the loop can execute again as long as `len(ar)` is greater than 3. If `i` is 4, `len(ar)` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `i` is less than `len(ar)`. If `i` is currently 4, `len(ar)` must be greater than 4. If `i` is currently 3, `len(ar)` must be greater than 3, which is already satisfied since `ar` has at least 3 elements.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is less than `len(ar)`. If `i` is 4, we must ensure `len(ar)` is at least 5. If `i` is 3, no adjustment is needed as long as `ar` has at least 3 elements.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements, `i` is 4, `num` is either `ar[2]` or `ar[3]`, `minn` is either 1 or the minimum of 1 and `ar[3]`, and `same` is either 1 or increased by 1**.

If `i` is 3, the state does not need adjustment for the loop to execute again:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 3, `num` is either `ar[2]` or `ar[3]`, `minn` is either 1 or the minimum of 1 and `ar[3]`, and `same` is either 1 or increased by 1**.

Since the task does not specify the exact value of `i`, we consider the worst case where `i` is 4 and needs adjustment:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements, `i` is 4, `num` is either `ar[2]` or `ar[3]`, `minn` is either 1 or the minimum of 1 and `ar[3]`, and `same` is either 1 or increased by 1**.
