To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop condition. In this case, the loop condition is `i < len(ar)`, so we need to ensure that `i` is less than the length of the list `ar`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `same` is 1
- `num` is `ar[0]`
- `minn` is `inf`
- `i` is 1

The variable `i` is initialized to 1. For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`. Since `i` is already 1, we need to ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than 1. 

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that the list `ar` has more than one element.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[0]`, `minn` is `inf`, `i` is 1**
