Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is `i + 1` (where `i` was either 3 or 4 at the end of the previous iteration), `num` is either `ar[0]` or `ar[2]`, `same` is either 3, 4, or 2 depending on the values of `ar[i-1]` and `ar[i-2]`, `minn` is either `inf` or 1 depending on the value of `same`**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1. So, if `same` was 2, it is now 3; if `same` was 3, it is now 4; and if `same` was 1, it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
