The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `ar`. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0 and `n` is an input integer. However, the value of `n` is not utilized in the provided code snippet. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
