Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines the minimum length of a sequence of consecutive identical numbers in the list `a`. If such a sequence exists, it prints the length; otherwise, it prints -1.**
