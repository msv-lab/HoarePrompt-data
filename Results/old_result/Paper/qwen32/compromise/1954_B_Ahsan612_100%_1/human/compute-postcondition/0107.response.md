Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is `i + 2` (where `i` was either 3 or 4 at the end of the previous iteration), `num` is either `ar[0]` or `ar[2]`, `same` is either 2, 3, or 1 depending on the values of `ar[i-1]` and `ar[i-2]`, `minn` is either `inf` or 1 depending on the value of `same`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was 3 or 4, it is now 4 or 5, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
