Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is either 2 or 3, `num` is either `ar[0]` or `ar[2]`. If `ar[i]` equals `num`, then `same` is 3 if `ar[i-1]` equals `num`, otherwise `same` is 2, and `minn` is `inf` if `same` is 3, otherwise `minn` is 1. If `ar[i]` does not equal `num`, then `i` is either 3 or 4, `num` is `ar[i]`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is 1.**
