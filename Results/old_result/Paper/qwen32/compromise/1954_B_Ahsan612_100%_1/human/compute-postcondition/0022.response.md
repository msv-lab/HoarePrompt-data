The code snippet provided only initializes a new variable `same` to 1. No other variables are modified in the provided code. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initial state of all other variables with the addition of the new variable `same`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `num` is updated to `ar[3]`, `minn` is updated to the minimum of 1 and `ar[3]`, `i` is 3, `same` is 1.**
