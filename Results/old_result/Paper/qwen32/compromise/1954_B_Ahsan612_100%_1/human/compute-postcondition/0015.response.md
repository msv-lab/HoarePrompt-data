Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. If `ar[i]` equals `num`, `same` is 2, `num` remains `ar[0]`, `minn` remains `inf`, and `i` remains 1. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is updated to `ar[2]`, `minn` is updated to 1, and `i` is updated to 2.**
