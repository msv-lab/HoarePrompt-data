The code snippet `num = ar[i]` updates the value of `num` to the element at index `i` in the list `ar`. Given that `i` is 3, `num` will now hold the value of `ar[3]`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `num` is updated to `ar[3]`, `minn` is updated to 1, and `i` is 3.**
