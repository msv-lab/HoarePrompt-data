Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers with at least 6 elements. If `ar[i]` was equal to `num`, then `i` is 4, `same` is 3, and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, `i` is 5 if `ar[i]` was equal to `num` otherwise `i` is 6, `num` is `ar[3]` if `i` was 3 otherwise `ar[4]`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is 2 if `i` was 3 otherwise `minn` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. If `i` was previously 3, it is now 4. If `i` was previously 4, it is now 5. If `i` was previously 5, it is now 6. All other variables remain unchanged.
