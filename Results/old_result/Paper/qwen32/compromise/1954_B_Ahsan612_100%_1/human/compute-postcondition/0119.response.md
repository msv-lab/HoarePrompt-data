Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last unique element in `ar`, `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive equal elements. If `minn` was originally `inf` or equal to `len(ar)`, it remains unchanged. Otherwise, `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`.**
