To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and how the variables change.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ar` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `num` is `ar[0]`.
   - `same` is 1.
   - `minn` is `inf`.

2. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i < len(ar)`.
   - If `ar[i] == num`, it increments `same`.
   - If `ar[i] != num`, it updates `i`, `num`, and `minn`:
     - Increments `i` by 1.
     - Sets `num` to `ar[i]`.
     - Updates `minn` to the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
     - Resets `same` to 1.
   - Regardless of the condition, `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

3. **Final State:**
   - The loop terminates when `i` is no longer less than `len(ar)`, i.e., `i` equals `len(ar)`.
   - At the end of the loop, `minn` will hold the minimum value of `same` encountered during the sequence of consecutive equal elements in the list `ar`.

### Conclusion:
- The final value of `i` will be `len(ar)`.
- `num` will be the last unique element encountered in the list.
- `same` will be the count of the last sequence of consecutive equal elements.
- `minn` will be the minimum count of consecutive equal elements found in the list.

### Output State:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last unique element in `ar`, `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive equal elements, `minn` is the minimum count of consecutive equal elements in `ar`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `i` will be the length of the list `ar`, `num` will be the last unique element in the list, `same` will be how many times the last element was repeated consecutively, and `minn` will be the smallest number of times any element was consecutively repeated in the list.
