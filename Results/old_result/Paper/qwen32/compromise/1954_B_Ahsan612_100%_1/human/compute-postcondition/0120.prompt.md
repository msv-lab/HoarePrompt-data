Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
    same = 1
    num = ar[0]
    minn = inf
    i = 1
    while i < len(ar):
        if ar[i] == num:
            same += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            num = ar[i]
            minn = min(minn, same)
            same = 1
        i += 1
    minn = min(minn, same)
    if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(minn)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `num` is the last unique number in `ar`, `same` is the count of the last sequence of identical numbers, and `minn` is the minimum of its current value and `same`. If `minn` is either equal to infinity or equal to the length of `ar`, then `minn` retains that value. Otherwise, `minn` is neither equal to infinity nor equal to the length of `ar`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers, `i` is the length of `ar`, `num` is the last unique element in a sequence, `same` is the count of the last sequence of identical elements, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`. If `minn` is either `inf` or equal to the length of `ar`, then `minn` retains its value as `inf` or the length of `ar`. Otherwise, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last unique element in `ar`, `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive equal elements. If `minn` was originally `inf` or equal to `len(ar)`, it remains unchanged. Otherwise, `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
