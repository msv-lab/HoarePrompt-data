Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is either 2 or 3, `num` is either `ar[0]` or `ar[2]`, `same` is 3 if `ar[i-1]` equals `num` (i.e., `ar[1]` equals `ar[0]` or `ar[2]` equals `ar[0]` if `i` was 2 and `ar[2]` equals `ar[1]` if `i` was 3), otherwise `same` is 2, and `minn` is `inf` if `same` is 3, otherwise `minn` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `same` is incremented by 1. If `same` was 2 (meaning `ar[i-1]` was equal to `num`), it becomes 3. If `same` was 1, it becomes 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`, and `minn` remain unchanged except for `same`.
