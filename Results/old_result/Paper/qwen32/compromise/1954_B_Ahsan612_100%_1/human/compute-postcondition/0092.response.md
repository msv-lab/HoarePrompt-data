The value of `num` is updated to be the element at index `i` in the list `ar`. Given that `i` is 2, `num` is now equal to `ar[2]`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `num` is `ar[2]`, `same` is 1, `minn` is `inf`**.
