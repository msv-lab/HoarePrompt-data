### Reasoning:

The program determines the winner of the game based on the sum of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key observation here is whether the sum of the coins is even or odd. 

The game's rules and the optimal play strategy imply that:
- If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob will win.
- If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, Alice will win.

This is because the game essentially boils down to who will be forced to take the last coin when the total number of coins is odd or even. When the total is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves and force Alice to take the last coin, leading to Bob's win. Conversely, when the total is odd, Alice can make a move that leaves an even number of coins, forcing Bob into a losing position.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and printing the appropriate winner based on this condition.
