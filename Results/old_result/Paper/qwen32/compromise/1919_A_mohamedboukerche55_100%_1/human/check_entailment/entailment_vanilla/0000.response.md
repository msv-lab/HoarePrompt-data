Reasoning:
The provided program determines the winner of the game based on the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The logic used in the program is correct based on the problem description.

The key to solving this problem is to realize that the game can be reduced to a simple parity (even or odd) check on the total number of coins (a + b). Here's the reasoning:

1. If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob will win. This is because no matter how the coins are distributed between Alice and Bob, the player who starts the game (Alice) will always be forced into a position where she ends up with the last turn when there is an even number of coins. Since the game ends when a player cannot make a move (i.e., when both wallets have 0 coins), Bob will be the last player to make a valid move.

2. If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, Alice will win. This is because with an odd number of coins, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob with an even number of coins to start his turn. Eventually, Bob will be forced into a position where he ends up with the last turn, and Alice will be the last player to make a valid move.

The given program correctly implements this logic by checking if the sum of a and b is even or odd and printing "Bob" or "Alice" accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
