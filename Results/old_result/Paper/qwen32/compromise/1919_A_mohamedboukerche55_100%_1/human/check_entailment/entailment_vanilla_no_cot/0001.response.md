Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The game revolves around the total number of coins (a + b) that Alice and Bob have combined. The key to solving this problem is to understand the concept of winning and losing positions based on the total number of coins.

1. **Even Total Coins (a + b is even):**
   - If the total number of coins is even, Bob will always win if both play optimally.
   - This is because Alice will always be forced into a position where she has an odd number of coins left after her turn, and Bob can always respond in such a way that he leaves Alice with an even number of coins after his turn. Eventually, Alice will be left with 0 coins, making her unable to make a move.

2. **Odd Total Coins (a + b is odd):**
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always win if both play optimally.
   - This is because Alice can always leave Bob with an even number of coins after her turn. Eventually, Bob will be left with 0 coins, making him unable to make a move.

### Program Analysis
The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of coins Alice and Bob have (a and b). It then checks if the total number of coins (a + b) is even or odd.

- If the total number of coins is even, the program prints "Bob".
- If the total number of coins is odd, the program prints "Alice".

This logic aligns perfectly with the analysis above. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Conclusion
The program correctly determines the winner based on the total number of coins and the optimal play strategy described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
