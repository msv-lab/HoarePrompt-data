Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `string` is the new user input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is the length of the new `s`; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `done` is False; `count` is 0 or updated based on conditions; `count2` is 0 or updated based on conditions; `i` is `i + 1`. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the state remains as described. If `n` is odd and the middle character of `s` is not equal to `x`, the state remains as described.**
