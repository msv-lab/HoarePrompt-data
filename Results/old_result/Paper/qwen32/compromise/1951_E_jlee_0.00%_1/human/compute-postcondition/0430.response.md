Postcondition: **t is greater than 0; string is the new user input; s is a list of characters from the new string; n is the length of the new s; x is the first character of the new string; if done is False, the string is not symmetric and i is i + 1; count and count2 retain their values from the last iteration. If done is True, the state of the variables remains unchanged from the precondition.**
