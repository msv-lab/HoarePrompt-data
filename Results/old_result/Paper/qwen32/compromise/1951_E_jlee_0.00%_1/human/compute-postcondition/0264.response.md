To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `string` is a new user input.
3. `s` is a list of characters from the new `string` with `n` being at least 1.
4. `x` is the first character of the new `string`.
5. `i` is the value that allows the loop to check the condition `i < t` again.
6. `j` is incremented by 1.
7. `count` is equal to `j` if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1.
8. `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to the variables.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

### Analysis:
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`, so `s[j]` refers to the character at index `j` in `string`.
- `x` is the first character of `string`, i.e., `x = string[0]`.
- `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
- The loop continues as long as `i < t`, but the exact loop structure is not provided. However, based on the description, it seems that `j` is incremented until a character in `s` is not equal to `x` or `count` is no longer less than 1.
- `count` is set to `j` when `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1. This suggests that `j` is the index of the first character in `string` that is different from `x`.
- `done` is set to True and we break out of the loop when `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1.

### Output:
- `string[:j]` will print the substring of `string` from the beginning up to (but not including) the index `j`.
- `string[j:]` will print the substring of `string` from the index `j` to the end.

Given the conditions, `j` is the index of the first character in `string` that is different from the first character `x`. Therefore, `string[:j]` will be the sequence of characters at the beginning of `string` that are all equal to `x`, and `string[j:]` will be the rest of the string starting from the first character that is different from `x`.

### Final Output:
Output: **string[:j] string[j:] (where j is the index of the first character in string that is different from the first character x)**
