Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `string` is the new user input, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new `string`, `j` is `j + 1`, `count2` retains its previous value if `count2 == count` or `count` is greater than 1, otherwise `count2` is set to 0. `done` is set to True if `count2` is greater than `count` or `count` is greater than 1; otherwise, `done` retains its previous value. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j`; otherwise, `count` retains its previous value.**
