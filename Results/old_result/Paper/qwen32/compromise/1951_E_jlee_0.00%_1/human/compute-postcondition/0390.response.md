Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `string` is the new user input, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new `string`, `count` is unchanged. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, then `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` equals `count` and `count` is greater than 1, then `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` does not equal `count` and `count2` is greater than `count`, then `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If none of the above conditions are met, `done` remains unchanged, and the variables `i`, `j`, `count`, and `count2` retain their previous values.**
