Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `string` is the user input, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of `string`, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and is less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `count` is greater than 1, then `done` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `done` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged and `count` is set to `j`. Additionally, if `count` is not greater than 1, `count2` is set to 0.**
