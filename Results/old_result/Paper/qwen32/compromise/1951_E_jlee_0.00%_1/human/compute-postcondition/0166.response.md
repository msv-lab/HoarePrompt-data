The given initial state describes several variables and conditions, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the specific values of the variables `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `done`, `count`, `count2`, or `i`. The `print` statement is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Therefore, the output of the code is:

Output: **YES**
