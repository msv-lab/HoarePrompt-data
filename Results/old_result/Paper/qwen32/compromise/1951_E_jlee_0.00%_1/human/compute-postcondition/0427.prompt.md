Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0; `string` is the new user input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is the length of the new `s`; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `done` is False; `count` is 0; `count2` is 0; `i` is `i + 1`. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the state remains as described. If `s.count(x) == n`, the state remains as described. If `s.count(x) == n - 1` and `n` is odd, the middle character of `s` is not equal to `x`, the state remains as described.
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0; `string` is the new user input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`; `i` is `i + 1`. If `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is set to 0 if `count` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, or `count2` equals `count` if `count` is greater than 1. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is 1. If `count` is 0, `count2` retains its original value of 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `string` is the new user input, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new `string`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`, and `j` is `j + 1`. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, or `count2` equals `count` and `count` is greater than 1, or `count2` does not equal `count` and `count2` is greater than `count`, then `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged, and the variables `i`, `j`, `count`, and `count2` retain their previous values. If `count` is not greater than 0, the behavior remains as described in the precondition without any additional changes to `count2` or `done`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `string` is the new user input, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new `string`, `j` is `j + 1`. If `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is set to 0 if `count2` was equal to `count` or `count` was greater than 1; otherwise, `count2` retains its previous value. `done` is set to True if `count2` is greater than `count` or `count` is greater than 1; otherwise, `done` retains its previous value. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1, and `count` and `done` retain their previous values. If `count` is not greater than 0, the conditions for `count2` and `done` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
