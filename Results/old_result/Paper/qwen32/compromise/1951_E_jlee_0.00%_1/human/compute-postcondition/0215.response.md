Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `string` is the new user input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string` with `n` being at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `count` is greater than 0; `count2` is either 0, greater than 0 and less than `count`, or equal to `count` if `count` is greater than 1; `i` is the value that allows the loop to check the condition `i < t` again; `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, or `count2` is greater than `count`; `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. If `count2` is greater than `count`, the loop or if statement is broken out of.**
