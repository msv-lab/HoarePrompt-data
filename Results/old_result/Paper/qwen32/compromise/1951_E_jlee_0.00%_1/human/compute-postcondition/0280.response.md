Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `string` is the new user input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string` with `n` being at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `i` is the value that allows the loop to check the condition `i < t` again; `j` is incremented by 1; `count` is equal to `j` if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1; `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `count2` is greater than `count`. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to the variables.**
