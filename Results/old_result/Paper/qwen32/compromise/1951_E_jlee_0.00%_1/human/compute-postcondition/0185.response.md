Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `string` is the new user input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string` with `n` being at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `count` is `j` if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, otherwise `count` remains unchanged; `count2` is 0; `i` is the value that allows the loop to check the condition `i < t` again; `done` remains False unless `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, in which case `done` is set to True and the loop or if statement is broken out of.**
