The code snippet simply sets the variable `done` to `True`. Therefore, the value of `done` changes, but all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `string` is the user input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of `string`; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and must be less than `(n + 1) // 2`; `done` is True**.
