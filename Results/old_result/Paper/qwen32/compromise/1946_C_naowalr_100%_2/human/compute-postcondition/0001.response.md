To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given loop and the initial state. The loop reads an integer from standard input and then calls the `solve()` function that many times.

**Initial State:** No variables are present in the function signature for `func_1`.

The loop itself introduces no new variables that persist outside of its scope. It only uses a temporary loop variable `_` which does not affect the external state. The function `solve()` is called multiple times, but without knowing what `solve()` does, we can't infer any changes to the external state based on its calls alone.

Since no variables are introduced or modified in the loop head or body that would affect the external state, and no variables are mentioned in the initial state, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

**Output State:** **No variables are present in the function signature for `func_1`.**
