#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature for `func_1`.
def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
        solve()
        
    #State: 
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer from the standard input, which represents the number of times a function named `solve` should be called. It does not accept any parameters or return any value; instead, it performs the `solve` function the specified number of times.
