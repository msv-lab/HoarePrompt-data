To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop:

```
while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of the `permutation` list.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `k` are integers where `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even.
- `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with specific elements set to certain values.
- `idx` is 0.
- `idx_v` is 1.
- `curr_v` is `floor((n-1)/k) + 3`.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + k`.
- `i` is 1.

The length of the `permutation` list is `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `n`. Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` starts at `1 + k` and `k` is at least 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is initially at least 3.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to make sure `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is still less than `n`. Since the loop modifies `multiples_of_k_plus_i` within its body (which we don't know how), we assume that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` has just completed an iteration and is now `1 + k + j*k` for some integer `j` such that the loop condition still holds.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is still less than `n` after the last increment. If `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is currently `1 + k`, we need to ensure that `1 + k < n`.

Since the problem specifies that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even, `1 + k` will always be less than `n` unless `k` is `n-1` and `n` is odd, but since `k` is even, this scenario is not possible.

Thus, no further adjustment is needed for `multiples_of_k_plus_i` as long as it remains `1 + k` or any valid incremented value that is still less than `n`.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers where `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with elements at indices `0, k, 2*k, ..., floor((n-1)/k)*k` set to `1, 2, 3, ..., floor((n-1)/k)+1`, except the element at index 1 is `floor((n-1)/k) + 2`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor((n-1)/k) + 3`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + k`; `i` is 1**
