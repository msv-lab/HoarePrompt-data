Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers where `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with elements at indices `0, k, 2*k, ..., floor((n-1)/k)*k` set to `1, 2, 3, ..., floor((n-1)/k)+1`, except the element at index 1 is `floor((n-1)/k) + 2` and the element at index `1 + k` is `floor((n-1)/k) + 3`, and the element at index `1 + 2*k` is `floor((n-1)/k) + 4`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor((n-1)/k) + 5`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + 2*k`; `i` is 1.** 

Explanation: The value of `curr_v` is incremented by 1, changing its value from `floor((n-1)/k) + 4` to `floor((n-1)/k) + 5`. All other variables remain unchanged.
