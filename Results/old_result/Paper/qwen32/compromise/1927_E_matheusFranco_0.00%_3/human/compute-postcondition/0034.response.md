To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `permutation` list and the variables involved.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop continues as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of the `permutation` list.
- In each iteration, it sets the value at index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` in the `permutation` list to `curr_v`.
- After setting the value, `curr_v` is incremented by 1, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is incremented by `k`.

### Initial State:
- `permutation` starts with elements at indices `0, k, 2*k, ..., floor((n-1)/k)*k` set to `1, 2, 3, ..., floor((n-1)/k)+1`.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` starts at `1`.
- `curr_v` starts at `floor((n-1)/k) + 2`.

### Iterations:
- After the first iteration, `permutation[1]` is set to `floor((n-1)/k) + 2`.
- After the second iteration, `permutation[1 + k]` is set to `floor((n-1)/k) + 3`.
- After the third iteration, `permutation[1 + 2*k]` is set to `floor((n-1)/k) + 4`.
- This pattern continues until `multiples_of_k_plus_i` reaches or exceeds the length of the `permutation` list.

### Final State:
- The loop will terminate when `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is no longer less than `n`.
- The last valid index that gets updated is `1 + (floor((n-2)/k)) * k`.
- The value at this index will be `floor((n-1)/k) + floor((n-2)/k) + 2`.

### Calculation of the Final State:
- The `permutation` list will have its initial values at indices `0, k, 2*k, ..., floor((n-1)/k)*k` and additional values starting from index `1` in steps of `k` up to the maximum valid index.
- The variables `idx`, `idx_v`, and `i` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
- `curr_v` will be `floor((n-1)/k) + 2 + floor((n-2)/k) + 1` after the loop terminates.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be `1 + k * (floor((n-2)/k) + 1)` which is equal to `n` or greater, causing the loop to terminate.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers where `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with elements at indices `0, k, 2*k, ..., floor((n-1)/k)*k` set to `1, 2, 3, ..., floor((n-1)/k)+1`, and elements at indices `1, 1+k, 1+2*k, ..., 1+floor((n-2)/k)*k` set to `floor((n-1)/k) + 2, floor((n-1)/k) + 3, ..., floor((n-1)/k) + floor((n-2)/k) + 2`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor((n-1)/k) + floor((n-2)/k) + 3`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `n` or greater; `i` is 1.** 

In simpler terms, the `permutation` list will have its initial values at multiples of `k` and additional sequential values starting from `floor((n-1)/k) + 2` at indices `1, 1+k, 1+2*k, ..., 1+floor((n-2)/k)*k`. The loop terminates when `multiples_of_k_plus_i` reaches `n` or more.
