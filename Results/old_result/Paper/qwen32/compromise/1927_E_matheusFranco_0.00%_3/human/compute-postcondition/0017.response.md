Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers where `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element set to 1, the element at index `k` set to 2, and the element at index `2 * k` set to 3; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is 4; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2 * k`.**

Natural Language: The value of `curr_v` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
