The code snippet increments the variable `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k`. Given the initial state, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` was initially set to `k`. After executing the code, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` becomes `k + k`, which simplifies to `2 * k`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, where `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element set to 1 and the element at index `k` set to 2; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is 3; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2 * k`.**
