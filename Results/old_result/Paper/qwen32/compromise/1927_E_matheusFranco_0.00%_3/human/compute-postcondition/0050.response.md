To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `permutation` list and the value of `curr_v`. The loop runs `k` times, and in each iteration, it fills certain positions in the `permutation` list with consecutive values starting from `curr_v`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `permutation` is initialized as a list of `n` zeros.
   - `curr_v` starts at 1.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration `i` from 0 to `k-1`, the loop fills the indices `i, i+k, i+2k, ..., i+mk` (where `m` is the largest integer such that `i+mk < n`) with consecutive values starting from `curr_v`.
   - After filling these positions, `curr_v` is incremented by the number of positions filled in this iteration.

3. **Final State**:
   - After all `k` iterations, every index in the `permutation` list will have been filled with a unique value from 1 to `n`.

Given the pattern observed in the first three iterations, we can generalize that after `k` iterations, the `permutation` list will be completely filled with values from 1 to `n` in a specific order. The value of `curr_v` will be `n + 1` because it has been incremented `n` times.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, where `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of `n` integers from 1 to `n` in a specific order determined by the loop; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `n + 1`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the `permutation` list will contain all integers from 1 to `n` in a specific sequence, and `curr_v` will be `n + 1`.
