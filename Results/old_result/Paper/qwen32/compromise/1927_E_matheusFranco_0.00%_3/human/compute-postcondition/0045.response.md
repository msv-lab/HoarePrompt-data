To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head. The loop will continue as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of the `permutation` list.

Given:
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2*k + 2`.
- `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with specific elements set to certain values.

The loop condition is:
```
while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
```

Since `permutation` is a list of `n` elements, `len(permutation)` is `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `2*k + 2 < n`.

Let's analyze the current state:
- `n` must be greater than 4.
- `k` is even and `2 <= k <= n`.

Given these constraints, let's determine the necessary adjustments:

1. **Ensure `2*k + 2 < n`:**
   - Since `k` is even and `2 <= k <= n`, the smallest possible value for `k` is 2.
   - If `k = 2`, then `2*k + 2 = 6`.
   - For `2*k + 2 < n` to hold true, `n` must be greater than 6.

Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 6.

No other variables in the loop head (`multiples_of_k_plus_i` and `permutation`) need to be adjusted directly since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is derived from `k` and `permutation`'s length is `n`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 6, `k` is even, `2 <= k <= n`, `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with elements at indices `0, k, 2*k, ..., floor((n-1)/k)*k` set to `1, 2, 3, ..., floor((n-1)/k)+1`, elements at indices `1, 1+k, 1+2*k, ..., 1+floor((n-2)/k)*k` set to `floor((n-1)/k) + 2, floor((n-1)/k) + 3, ..., floor((n-1)/k) + floor((n-2)/k) + 2`, except the element at index 2 which is now `floor((n-1)/k) + floor((n-2)/k) + 3`, and the element at index `k + 2` is now `floor((n-1)/k) + floor((n-2)/k) + 4`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor((n-1)/k) + floor((n-2)/k) + 5`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2*k + 2`; `i` is 2**
