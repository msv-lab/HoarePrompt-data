### Reasoning

Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided code and its behavior against the problem requirements.

#### Code Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `permutation` is initialized as a list of zeros of length `n`.
   - Variables `idx`, `idx_v`, and `curr_v` are initialized. However, `idx` and `idx_v` are not used in the function.

2. **Filling the Permutation**:
   - The function iterates over `i` from 0 to `k-1`.
   - For each `i`, it fills the permutation at indices `multiples_of_k_plus_i` (starting at `i` and incrementing by `k` each time) with the current value `curr_v` and then increments `curr_v`.

3. **Printing the Result**:
   - After filling the permutation, it converts the list to a space-separated string and prints it.

#### Verification Against Requirements

The goal is to create a k-level permutation where the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any k-length contiguous subarray is at most 1.

Let's consider how the current implementation attempts to achieve this:

- The approach fills the permutation in a pattern where every `k`-th position starting from `i` (for `i` from 0 to `k-1`) is filled sequentially with increasing numbers.
- For example, for `n=10` and `k=4`, the permutation might look like this:
  - Starting from index 0: 1, 5, 9, ...
  - Starting from index 1: 2, 6, 10, ...
  - Starting from index 2: 3, 7, 11, ...
  - Starting from index 3: 4, 8, 12, ...

This pattern ensures that the numbers are distributed across the permutation in a way that minimizes the variation in sums of k-length contiguous subarrays. Specifically, the sums of these subarrays will be very close to each other because the numbers are evenly spread out.

#### Example Verification

Let's verify the pattern with an example:

- For `n=10` and `k=4`, the permutation would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` distributed as follows:
  - Indices 0, 4, 8: 1, 5, 9
  - Indices 1, 5, 9: 2, 6, 10
  - Indices 2, 6: 3, 7
  - Indices 3, 7: 4, 8

The sums of the k-length contiguous subarrays would be:
- `[1, 2, 3, 4]` -> Sum = 10
- `[2, 3, 4, 5]` -> Sum = 14
- `[3, 4, 5, 6]` -> Sum = 18
- `[4, 5, 6, 7]` -> Sum = 22
- `[5, 6, 7, 8]` -> Sum = 26
- `[6, 7, 8, 9]` -> Sum = 30
- `[7, 8, 9, 10]` -> Sum = 34

Clearly, the sums are not within a difference of 1, so the pattern needs adjustment.

#### Correct Pattern

A correct pattern should distribute the numbers in such a way that the sums of any k-length contiguous subarrays are as close as possible. One such pattern is to interleave the numbers in a way that balances the sums. For example:

- For `n=10` and `k=4`, a correct permutation could be `[1, 6, 3, 8, 5, 10, 2, 7, 4, 9]`.

This pattern ensures that the sums of the k-length contiguous subarrays are balanced.

### Conclusion

Given the pattern of filling the permutation, the current implementation does not guarantee that the sums of all k-length contiguous subarrays will have a difference of at most 1. Therefore, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**

Final: **False**
