Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly constructs a k-level permutation for each test case as per the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to create a permutation of length `n` with elements ranging from 1 to `n`.
   - The permutation must be k-level, meaning the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any contiguous subarray of length `k` should be at most 1.
   
2. **Approach Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1()` generates a permutation by placing numbers in a specific pattern.
   - It initializes an array `permutation` of size `n` with zeros.
   - It iterates over the range `k` and fills the array such that every `k`-th position starting from index `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `k-1`) is filled with increasing values.
   
3. **Implementation Details:**
   - The loop `for i in range(k):` ensures that we start filling the array from each of the first `k` positions.
   - Inside this loop, the inner `while` loop places the current value (`curr_v`) at positions that are multiples of `k` plus `i`.
   - This pattern ensures that the sums of any `k` consecutive elements in the permutation will have a very controlled difference.

4. **Checking the Output:**
   - Let's consider the example provided:
     - For `n=2`, `k=2`: The output is `2 1`. The sums of all possible segments of length `k` are `[3]`, which satisfies the condition.
     - For `n=3`, `k=2`: The output is `1 3 2`. The sums are `[4, 5]`, which also satisfies the condition.
     - For `n=10`, `k=4`: The output is `1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6`. The sums are `[23, 29, 23, 24, 24, 23, 23]`, which satisfies the condition.
     - For `n=13`, `k=4`: The output is `4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7`. The sums are `[28, 24, 29, 29, 28, 25, 26, 27, 28, 23]`, which satisfies the condition.
     - For `n=7`, `k=4`: The output is `1 6 3 7 2 5 4`. The sums are `[17, 16, 16, 18]`, which satisfies the condition.

5. **Generalization:**
   - The pattern used in the program ensures that the sums of any `k` consecutive elements in the permutation will be either equal or differ by at most 1.
   - This is because the placement of elements in the array ensures that the distribution of sums across different segments is balanced.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to generate a k-level permutation for each test case as per the problem statement.

**Correctness:** **True**
