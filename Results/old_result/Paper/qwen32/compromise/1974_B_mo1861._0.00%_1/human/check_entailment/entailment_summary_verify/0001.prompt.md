You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

- Function Summary: 
The function takes a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `s` where each unique character in `b` is replaced by a character from 'a' to 'z' in reverse order of their sorted appearance in `b`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
1. **Encoding Process:**
   - A new string `r` is created from the distinct characters of the original string `s` in alphabetical order.
   - Each character in the original string `s` is replaced by its symmetric character from `r`.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - Given an encoded string `b`, we need to restore the original string `s`.
   - This involves reversing the encoding process.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Decoding Logic (`func_1` function):**
   - **Creating the Character Map:**
     - `char_map` is a dictionary that maps each character in the sorted set of `b` to its symmetric character.
     - The symmetric character is calculated as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, which is incorrect.
     - The correct symmetric character should be the character at the mirrored position in the sorted set of `b`, not a character based on the length of `b`.
   - **Building the Decoded String `s`:**
     - The decoded string `s` is constructed by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding value from `char_map`.

### Errors in the Program:
- The calculation for the symmetric character in `char_map` is incorrect. Instead of using `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, it should map each character in the sorted set of `b` to its symmetric counterpart in the same set.
- The provided program does not correctly map the characters to their symmetric counterparts in the context of the distinct characters of `b`.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Creating the Character Map:**
   - Sort the distinct characters of `b` to get `r`.
   - Map each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

2. **Building the Decoded String:**
   - Replace each character in `b` with its mapped value from the character map.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the incorrect calculation of the symmetric characters.

Correctness: **False**
