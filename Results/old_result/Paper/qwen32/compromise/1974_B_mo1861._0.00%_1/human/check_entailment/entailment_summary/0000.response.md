Reasoning: 

The provided program aims to decode an encoded string `b` back to its original form `s` by reversing the encoding process. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and whether it aligns with the problem description:

1. **Character Mapping Construction**:
   - The program first creates a set of unique characters from the input string `b` and sorts them in alphabetical order.
   - It then constructs a mapping (`char_map`) where each character in the sorted set is mapped to a character from the end of the alphabet ('z') to the beginning ('a'). Specifically, the first character in the sorted set is mapped to the last character of the alphabet, the second character to the second last, and so on.
   - However, the mapping constructed by the program does not align with the problem description. According to the problem, the mapping should be based on the distinct characters in `b` sorted in alphabetical order, and each character in `b` should be replaced by its symmetric character from this sorted set `r`, not the entire alphabet.

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - The program iterates through each character in the encoded string `b` and uses the mapping to find the corresponding character in the original string `s`.
   - Given the incorrect mapping, the decoded string `s` will not match the original string that was encoded.

To correct the program, the mapping should be constructed based on the distinct characters in `b` sorted in alphabetical order, and each character in `b` should be replaced by its symmetric character from this sorted set `r`. Here's the corrected mapping construction:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-i-1] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    s = ''.join([char_map[c] for c in b])
    return s
```

Given the current implementation of the program, it does not correctly decode the string `b` back to the original string `s` because of the incorrect mapping construction.

Correctness: **False**
