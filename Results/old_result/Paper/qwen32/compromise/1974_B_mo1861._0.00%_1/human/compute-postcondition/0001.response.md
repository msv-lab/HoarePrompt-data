The code snippet initializes an empty dictionary named `char_map`. This operation does not affect the string `b` or its length `n`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`b` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of `b` is a positive integer `n` such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5; `char_map` is an empty dictionary.**
