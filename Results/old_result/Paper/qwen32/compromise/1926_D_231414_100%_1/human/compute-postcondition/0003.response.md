`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `times` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `times` is an integer such that 1 <= `times` <= 10^4, and `n` is the integer value obtained from the input.

Output State: **`times` is an integer such that 1 <= `times` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer**
