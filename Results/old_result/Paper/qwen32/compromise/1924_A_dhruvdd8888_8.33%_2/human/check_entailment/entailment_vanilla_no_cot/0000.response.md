Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Logic Error**: The program does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` occur as a subsequence in `s`. It only checks for a very specific pattern where it collects characters until it has seen all `k` distinct characters and then resets the set. This does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are present.

2. **Generating Missing Subsequence**: The program's method for generating a missing subsequence is incorrect. It does not guarantee that the generated string of length `n` is the shortest or does not occur in `s`.

3. **Output Handling**: The program does not handle the output correctly. If the condition `ps >= n` is not met, it should generate a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`, but the current logic does not ensure this.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to:

- Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- Check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.
- If all are present, print "YES". Otherwise, print "NO" and provide one string that is not a subsequence.

Here is a more correct approach:

```python
def is_subsequence(x, y):
    it = iter(y)
    return all(c in it for c in x)

def generate_strings(n, k):
    if n == 0:
        return [""]
    smaller_strings = generate_strings(n - 1, k)
    return [c + s for c in "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"[:k] for s in smaller_strings]

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    all_strings = generate_strings(n, k)
    for candidate in all_strings:
        if not is_subsequence(candidate, s):
            print("NO")
            print(candidate)
            break
    else:
        print("YES")
```

This approach generates all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` letters and checks each one to see if it is a subsequence of `s`. If it finds one that is not, it prints "NO" and the string. If all are found, it prints "YES".
