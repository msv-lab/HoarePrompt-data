You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the given program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Input:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Length of the strings to check.
     - `k`: Number of distinct lowercase English letters to use (from 'a' to the k-th letter).
     - `m`: Length of the string `s`.
     - `s`: A string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English letters.
   
2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, print "YES" if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` letters appear as a subsequence in `s`. Otherwise, print "NO" followed by a string of length `n` that does not appear as a subsequence in `s`.

### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the string `s` and checking for subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` letters. The logic in the program, however, seems flawed for the problem requirements.

1. **Initialization:**
   - `us`: A set of the first `k` lowercase English letters.
   - `win`: A set to keep track of the unique characters seen in the current window of `s`.
   - `ans`: A list to accumulate characters that form a potential subsequence.
   - `ps`: A counter to count the number of valid subsequences found.

2. **Main Loop:**
   - The program iterates through each character `i` in `s`.
   - If `i` is in `us`, it adds `i` to `win`.
   - If `win` contains all `k` characters, it appends `i` to `ans`, increments `ps`, and clears `win`.
   - This approach seems to be trying to find valid subsequences of length `n` by accumulating characters and resetting when a full set of `k` characters is found. However, this does not guarantee that all subsequences of length `n` are checked, and it does not correctly identify missing subsequences.

3. **Output:**
   - If `ps` is at least `n`, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and attempts to construct a missing subsequence by appending characters from `us` not in `win` to `ans`. This part of the logic is also flawed because it does not ensure that the constructed string is indeed a valid missing subsequence.

### Correctness

The program does not correctly implement the logic to check all possible subsequences of length `n` and identify missing ones. It incorrectly assumes that finding a full set of `k` characters in `s` is enough to count as a valid subsequence, which is not the case. Additionally, the method to construct a missing subsequence is not guaranteed to produce a valid answer.

**Correctness: False**

The program would need a more robust approach to check all possible subsequences of length `n` and identify any missing ones. A correct approach might involve generating all possible subsequences of length `n` and checking each one against `s`. Alternatively, a more efficient approach could involve using dynamic programming to count the occurrences of subsequences in `s`.
