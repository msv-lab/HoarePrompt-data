The given Python code snippet creates a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers with specific constraints, and `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

The code:
```python
us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
```
generates a set of characters from 'a' to the `k`-th letter of the alphabet.

Given this, the output state will include the newly created set `us` along with the unchanged variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input where 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; the string `s` is the input string of length `m` and consists only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.**
