Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to split the array `a` into two subsequences `s` and `t` such that the sum of penalties `p(s)` and `p(t)` is minimized. The penalty `p(b)` of a subsequence `b` is the number of indices `i` where `b_i < b_{i+1}`.

### Key Observations:
1. **Splitting Strategy**: To minimize the penalty, it's optimal to greedily split the array such that the elements are distributed in a way that minimizes the number of increasing subsequences.
2. **Two Pointers**: The code uses two variables `x` and `y` to track the smallest elements not yet used in subsequences `s` and `t` respectively.
3. **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty is incremented whenever an element `a` is greater than both `x` and `y`, indicating that it cannot be appended to either existing subsequence without increasing the penalty.

### Code Analysis:
Let's walk through the code to see if it correctly implements the above logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `x` and `y` are initialized to `n + 1` (a value greater than any possible element in the array).
   - `ans` is initialized to `0` to keep track of the penalty.

2. **Processing Each Element**:
   - For each element `a` in the array:
     - If `a <= x`, it means `a` can be appended to subsequence `s` without increasing the penalty, so `x` is updated to `a`.
     - Else if `a <= y`, it means `a` can be appended to subsequence `t` without increasing the penalty, so `y` is updated to `a`.
     - Else, both `x` and `y` have smaller elements, and appending `a` would increase the penalty. Therefore, we increment `ans` and update `x` and `y` such that `x` becomes `y` and `y` becomes `a`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements, the code prints the total penalty `ans`.

### Issues in the Code:
The line `x == y` in the code is incorrect. It should be an assignment `x = y` to update `x` to the current value of `y` before updating `y` to `a`. Without this assignment, `x` remains `n + 1` after the first time `a` is greater than both `x` and `y`, which can lead to incorrect penalty calculations.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        (*inp,) = map(int, input().split())
        x = y = n + 1
        ans = 0
        for a in inp:
            if a <= x:
                x = a
            elif a <= y:
                y = a
            else:
                x = y  # Corrected line
                y = a
                ans += 1
        print(ans)
```

### Conclusion:
The original code is incorrect due to the incorrect assignment `x == y`. After fixing this, the code should correctly implement the optimal splitting strategy to minimize the penalty.

Correctness: **False**
