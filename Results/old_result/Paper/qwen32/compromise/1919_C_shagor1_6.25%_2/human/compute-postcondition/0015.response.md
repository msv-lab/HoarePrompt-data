Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `inp` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element; `x` is `n + 1`; `y` is `a`; `a` is greater than `x`. If `a` is less than or equal to `y`, then `ans` is `0`. Otherwise, `ans` is `1`.**
