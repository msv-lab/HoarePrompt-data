The code snippet `x = a` assigns the value of `a` to `x`. The value of `a` is `a_next` (the integer following the current `a` in `inp`), and this value is now assigned to `x`. The other variables `inp`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `n` is an input integer, `a` is `a_next` (the integer following the current `a` in `inp`), `x` is `a_next`**.
