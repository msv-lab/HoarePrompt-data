Postcondition: **`inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `x` is `a` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `x` remains `n + 1`; `y` is `n + 1` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `y` is `a`; `ans` is 0 if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, otherwise `ans` is 1; `n` is an input integer.**
