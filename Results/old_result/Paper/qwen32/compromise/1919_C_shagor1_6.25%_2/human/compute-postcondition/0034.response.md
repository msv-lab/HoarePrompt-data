Let's break down the problem step by step based on the provided initial state:

1. **Identify the variables and their definitions:**
   - `x` is the smallest element in the list `inp`.
   - `y` is the second smallest element in the list `inp` if it exists. If it does not exist, `y` is the same as `x`.
   - `ans` is the count of elements in the list `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

2. **Determine the value of `ans`:**
   - `ans` is calculated by counting the elements in `inp` that are strictly greater than both `x` and `y`.

3. **Formulate the output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`.

Since the exact list `inp` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`)**
