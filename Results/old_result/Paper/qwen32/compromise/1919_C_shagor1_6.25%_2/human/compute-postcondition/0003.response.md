The code assigns the value `n + 1` to both `x` and `y`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range and `n` is an input integer, and `inp` is a list of integers. After the execution of the code snippet, the values of `x` and `y` are updated to `n + 1`, while `t` and `inp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `inp` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `x` is `n + 1`; `y` is `n + 1`.**
