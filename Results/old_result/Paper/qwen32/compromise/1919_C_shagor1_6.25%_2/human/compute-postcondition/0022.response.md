The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The other variables `t`, `n`, `inp`, `a`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `inp` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element; `a` is the next element in `inp` after the previous value of `a`; `y` is equal to `a`; `ans` is incremented by 1.**
