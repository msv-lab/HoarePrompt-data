Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `inp` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element; `a` is the next element in `inp` after the previous value of `a`; if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, then `y` is updated to the value of `a`. Otherwise, `y` is updated to the value of `a` and `ans` is incremented by 1.**
