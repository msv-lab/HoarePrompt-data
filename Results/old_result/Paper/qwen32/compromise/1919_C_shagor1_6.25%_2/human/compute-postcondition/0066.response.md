Postcondition: **`inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `x` is `a` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `x` remains `n + 1`; `y` is `a`; `ans` is 0 if `a` is less than or equal to `y` (which is always true in this case, so `ans` is 0), otherwise `ans` is 1 if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1` and `ans` is 2 if `a` is greater than `n + 1`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the next element in `inp`.**
