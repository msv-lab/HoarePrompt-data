Output State: **the output state you calculate.**

Given the loop and the initial state described, the loop iterates over the list `results` and prints each element. Since the loop body only involves printing and does not modify any variables outside of the loop, the state of `start`, `end`, and `t` remains unchanged. The only change is the output to the console, which is not reflected in the state format.

Therefore, the output state in the required format is:

Output State: **start and end are integers such that start <= end; t is an input integer; results is a list of strings ('yes' or 'no') determined by the input strings in each iteration.**
