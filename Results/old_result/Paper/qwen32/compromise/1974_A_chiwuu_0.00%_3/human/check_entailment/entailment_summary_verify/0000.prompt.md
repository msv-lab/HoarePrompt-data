You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b * 2
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5
        else:
            t = t // 5 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons. For each test case, it calculates and prints the total number of 2x2 icon groups required to accommodate both the 1x1 and 2x2 icons, considering specific grouping rules.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
Let's analyze the given program to see if it meets the problem description correctly.

The program is supposed to determine the minimum number of 5x3 screens required to place a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program logic:

1. For each test case, the program reads the number of 1x1 icons (`a`) and 2x2 icons (`b`).
2. It calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons (`t`). Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells (5x3). The program calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons by converting the number of 2x2 icons to equivalent 1x1 icons (`t = b * 2`) and then dividing by 15. If the result is not an integer, it rounds up to the next whole number.
3. It then calculates the remaining space on the screens used for 2x2 icons (`t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`) and checks if this space is sufficient to place the 1x1 icons (`a`).
4. If the remaining space is sufficient, it uses the calculated number of screens (`t`). Otherwise, it calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons and adds this to the initial number of screens.

The issue with this program is that it does not properly account for the placement of 2x2 icons on the 5x3 screens. Specifically, it does not consider the actual spatial arrangement of icons on the screens, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the test case `a = 1, b = 2`. According to the program, the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is:

- `t = 2 * 2 = 4` (equivalent 1x1 icons)
- `t = 4 // 15 + 1 = 1` (rounding up)

However, it is impossible to fit 2 2x2 icons on a single 5x3 screen because each 2x2 icon occupies a 2x2 area, and there is no way to place two such icons without overlapping or exceeding the screen boundaries.

Therefore, for this test case, the program would output `1`, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be `2` screens, as each 2x2 icon requires its own screen.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, and the correctness is **False**.
