To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider how the loop variables evolve with each iteration and the conditions under which the loop terminates.

From the provided information:
- The loop continues as long as `cnt > 0` and `l < n + 1`.
- After each iteration, `cnt` is decremented by 1, and `l` is updated to `func_2() + 1`.

Given the output states after the first three iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
- After 2 iterations: `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` (and must be less than `n + 1`).
- After 3 iterations: `cnt` is `k - 3`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` (and must be less than `n + 1`).

This pattern indicates that after `x` iterations, `cnt` will be `k - x` and `l` will be `func_2() + 1` (and must be less than `n + 1`).

The loop will terminate when either `cnt` becomes 0 or `l` becomes equal to or greater than `n + 1`. Since `cnt` starts at `k` and decreases by 1 each iteration, the loop will run at most `k` times. If `l` reaches `n + 1` before `cnt` reaches 0, the loop will terminate early.

Therefore, the final state of the loop will be when `cnt` is 0 (if `k` iterations complete without `l` reaching `n + 1`), or when `l` is no longer less than `n + 1` (if `l` reaches `n + 1` before `k` iterations complete).

Let's summarize the final state:
- `cnt` will be `0` if the loop completes `k` iterations.
- `l` will be the value of `func_2() + 1` from the last iteration, which must be `>= n + 1` if the loop terminated early due to `l` reaching `n + 1`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`), `cnt` is `0`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and must be `>= n + 1` if the loop terminated early, `i` is `2`.**

In simpler terms, the loop runs until it has completed `k` iterations or `l` reaches `n + 1`, whichever comes first. At the end, `cnt` will be `0`, and `l` will be the result of the last `func_2() + 1` call, which could be `>= n + 1` if the loop terminated early.
