The code snippet updates the value of `l` by setting it to the result of `func_2()` plus 1. The values of `n`, `k`, `v`, `cnt`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Since `l` was initially `1` and now it is set to `func_2() + 1`, we need to reflect this change in the output state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3 * k`, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`), `cnt` is `k`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `i` is `3`**.
