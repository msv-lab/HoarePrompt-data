The code snippet `cnt -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, `cnt` is initially `k`. After decrementing, `cnt` becomes `k - 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3 * k`, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`), `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `i` is `3`.**
