Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `i` is 3, `v` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the values of `n`, `k`, `i`, and `v` remain unchanged, but the program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
