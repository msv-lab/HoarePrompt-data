To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the line `v = func_2()`. This line assigns the return value of the function `func_2()` to the variable `v`. Since the function `func_2()` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine the exact value that `v` will take. However, we know that `v` will no longer hold its initial value of 1 but will instead hold whatever value `func_2()` returns.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output state can be described as follows:

- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `k` remains an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`.
- `v` is now assigned the value returned by `func_2()`.

Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`**.
