Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's determine the new state.

Initial State: 
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is an integer such that `3 <= k <= n`
- `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`)
- `cnt` is `k - 2`
- `l` is `func_2() + 1` and must be less than `n + 1`
- `i` is `2`

Code Snippet:
```python
l = func_2() + 1
```

Impact of the Code:
- The value of `l` is updated to the result of `func_2() + 1`.

Since `l` was previously defined as `func_2() + 1` and the code reassigns `l` to the same expression, the value of `l` remains the same unless `func_2()` returns a different value in this new context (which is not specified). For the sake of this exercise, we assume `func_2()` returns the same value as before.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same except for the explicit reassignment of `l`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `3 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`), `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and must be less than `n + 1`, `i` is `2`**.
