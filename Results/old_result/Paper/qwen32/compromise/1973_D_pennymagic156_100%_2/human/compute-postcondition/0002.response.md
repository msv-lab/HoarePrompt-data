To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

In this loop, the variable `i` starts from `n` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 1 (inclusive). The loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1 because the range function `range(n, 0, -1)` generates numbers starting from `n` down to 1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `1 <= k <= n`.
- `v` is 1.

Since `n` is already specified to be a positive integer, no adjustment is needed for `n` to ensure the loop can execute. The value of `k` and `v` are not directly related to the loop's execution condition, but they are part of the state.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is 1**

This ensures that the loop can execute as expected.
