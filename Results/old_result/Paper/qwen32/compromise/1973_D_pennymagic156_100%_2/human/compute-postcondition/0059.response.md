After executing the function call `func_2()`, the value of `v` will be updated to whatever value `func_2()` returns during this iteration (where `i = 2`). The values of `n`, `k`, `cnt`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the current iteration (`i = 2`), `cnt` is `0`, `l` is `n + 1`, and `i` is `2`.**
