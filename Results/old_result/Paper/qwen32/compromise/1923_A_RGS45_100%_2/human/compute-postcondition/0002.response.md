To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop for each of the `t` iterations. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of what the loop does:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - For each iteration, `n` is read as an integer, representing the number of elements in the array.
   - The second line contains `n` integers (`a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`), where each integer is either `0` or `1`.

2. **Processing**:
   - The input array is converted to a string and spaces are removed.
   - `x` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in the array.
   - `y` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` from the end of the array (which is equivalent to the index of the last occurrence of `1` from the start).
   - `z` is the substring of the array starting from the first `1` up to (but not including) the position right after the last `1`.
   - The number of `0`s in this substring `z` is counted and printed.

3. **Output**:
   - For each iteration, the count of `0`s between the first and last `1` in the array is printed.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is the integer input by the user.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
- The second line contains `n` integers (`a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`), where each integer is either `0` or `1`, and there is at least one `1` in each test case.

After all iterations, the output state would be the sequence of printed values, each representing the count of `0`s between the first and last `1` for each respective input array.

Thus, the output state can be described as a sequence of integers, each corresponding to the count of `0`s between the first and last `1` for each of the `t` input arrays.

Output State: **a sequence of integers, each representing the count of 0s between the first and last 1 for each of the t input arrays.**
