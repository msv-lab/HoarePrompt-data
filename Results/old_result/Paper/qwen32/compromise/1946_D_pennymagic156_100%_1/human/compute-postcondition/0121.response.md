To determine the output state, we need to understand the operation being performed on the variable `op`. The operation `op ^= val >> i & 1` involves several steps:

1. `val >> i`: This shifts the bits of `val` to the right by `i` positions. Given that `i` is 28, this operation extracts the 28th bit of `val`.
2. `& 1`: This performs a bitwise AND operation with 1, which isolates the least significant bit of the result from the right shift, effectively extracting the 28th bit of `val`.
3. `^=`: This is the XOR assignment operator, which means `op` is updated to the result of `op` XOR the extracted bit.

Given the initial state, `op` is initially 0. The new value of `op` will be the result of `0 XOR (val >> 28 & 1)`, which simplifies to just the value of the 28th bit of `val`.

Since `val` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can denote the 28th bit of `val` as `bit_28_of_val`. Therefore, the new value of `op` will be `bit_28_of_val`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list containing at least one element, `t` is an empty list, `i` is 28, `u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is the 28th bit of `val`, `ai` is 0**.
