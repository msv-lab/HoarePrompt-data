The code appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. The values of `n`, `x`, `a`, `u`, `v`, and `op` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list containing at least one `ai` value, `t` is a list containing `ai`, `u` equals 0, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `ai` is `val`. Additionally, `op` is 0.**
