Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list containing at least 30 elements, `i` is 28, `u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is the result of `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`. If `op` was initially `False`, `t` is a list containing `val` and `ai` is `0`. If `op` was initially `True`, `t` remains unchanged and `ai` is `0`. `val` is the 30th element of `a`.**
