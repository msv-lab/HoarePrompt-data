The given code snippet modifies the variable `op` by performing a bitwise XOR operation with the result of `val >> i & 1`. This means `op` will be updated based on the least significant bit of `val` shifted right by `i` positions.

Given the initial conditions:
- `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`
- If `op` is 0, `cnt` is set to 1; otherwise, `cnt` remains 0.
- `val` is the next element in the list `a`.
- `v` is even and non-zero.
- `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0.

After executing `op ^= val >> i & 1`, the new value of `op` will be the result of the XOR operation between the old `op` and the least significant bit of `val` shifted right by `i` positions.

The other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `cnt`) remain unchanged unless `op` becomes 0, which would trigger `cnt` to be set to 1.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a non-empty list, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`, `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `cnt` is 1 if `op` is 0, otherwise `cnt` remains 0, `val` is the next element in the list `a`.**
