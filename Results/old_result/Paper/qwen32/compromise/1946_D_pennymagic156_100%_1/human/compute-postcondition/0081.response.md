The given code modifies the value of `ai` by performing an XOR operation with `val`. Since `val` is specified as the third element of the list `a`, and `ai` is the first element of the list `a` which has already undergone an XOR operation with `val` initially, the new value of `ai` will be the result of this additional XOR operation.

Given that `ai` was initially transformed to `ai ^ val`, performing another `ai ^= val` operation will revert `ai` back to its original value before the first XOR operation because XORing a value with itself twice results in the original value.

Therefore, the updated value of `ai` will be its original value before the first XOR operation with `val`.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` is a list containing at least two `ai` values where the first `ai` value is now the original value before the first XOR operation with `val`. If `op` was 0, `t` contains `ai` and `ai` is set to 0. Otherwise, `t` remains an empty list. `u` equals 0, and `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`. `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`. `val` is the third element of `a`.**
