Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list with at least two elements, `t` is a list containing `val` as its first element, `val` as its second element, and `ai` as its third element, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` equals 0, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> i & 1) for val in a]` and `v` is even, `op` is `(val >> i) & 1`. If `op` is 0, then `ai` is 0.**
