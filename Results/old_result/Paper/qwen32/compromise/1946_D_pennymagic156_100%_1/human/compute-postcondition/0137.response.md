The given code snippet sets `ai` to 0. This means that the value of `ai` is explicitly changed, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **The loop terminates as there are no more elements in `a` after the 30th element; `op` is updated to `op ^ ((val >> i) & 1)`; `ai` is 0; `t` now contains `ai` as its last element.**
