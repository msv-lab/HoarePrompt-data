The given code snippet modifies the variable `ai` using the XOR operation with `val`. However, the value of `val` is not specified in the initial state, which means we cannot determine a specific new value for `ai` without knowing `val`. We can only express the new value of `ai` in terms of its previous value and `val`.

Given that `ai` was initially 0, after executing `ai ^= val`, the new value of `ai` will simply be `val` because `0 ^ val` equals `val`.

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list containing at least one `ai` value, `t` is an empty list, `u` equals 0, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `ai` is `val`**.

In natural language, the output state is: `n` and `x` remain the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list containing at least one `ai` value, `t` remains an empty list, `u` remains 0, `v` remains the sum of the bitwise AND of each value in `a` right-shifted by `i` and 1, `op` remains the result of the bitwise XOR of `op` and the bitwise AND of each value in `a` right-shifted by `i` and 1, and `ai` is now equal to `val`.
