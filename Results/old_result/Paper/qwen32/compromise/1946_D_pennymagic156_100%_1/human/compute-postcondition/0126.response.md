Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is 28, `u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`. If `op` is False, then `t` is a list containing `val` and `ai` is 0. Otherwise, `t` remains an empty list and `ai` is `val`.**
