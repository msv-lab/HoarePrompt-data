Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a non-empty list, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`, `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `cnt` is 2 if `op` was initially 0, otherwise `cnt` is 1, `val` is the next element in the list `a`.**
