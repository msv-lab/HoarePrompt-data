Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list containing at least one `ai` value, `t` is a list containing `ai` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` remains an empty list, `u` equals 0, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, and `ai` is 0 if `op` is 0, otherwise `ai` retains its original value.**
