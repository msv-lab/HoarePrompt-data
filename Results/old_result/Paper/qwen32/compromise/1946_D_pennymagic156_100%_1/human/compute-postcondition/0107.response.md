To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables `op` and `cnt` based on the elements in the list `a`.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each element `val` in the list `a`.
- For each iteration, it updates `op` using the XOR operation with the bit at position `i` of `val`.
- If `op` becomes 0 after the update, it increments `cnt`.

### Given Conditions:
- `a` is a non-empty list.
- `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0.
- `v` is the sum of bits at position `i` of all elements in `a`, and `v` is even and non-zero.
- Initially, `op` is 0 and `cnt` is 0.

### Implications:
- Since `v` is even and non-zero, there must be an even number of elements in `a` that have a 1-bit at position `i`.
- This means that the cumulative effect of XOR operations (`op ^= val >> i & 1`) will eventually lead to `op` being 0 after processing all elements in `a`.

### Iteration Process:
- After each iteration where `op` becomes 0, `cnt` is incremented.
- Since `v` is even, `op` will toggle between 0 and 1 as we process each element in `a`.
- However, because `v` is even, `op` will end up being 0 after processing all elements, and `cnt` will reflect the number of times `op` was 0 during the loop.

### Final Output State:
- After all iterations, `op` will be 0.
- `cnt` will be half the number of elements in `a` (since `v` is even, `op` toggles between 0 and 1, and `cnt` increments only when `op` is 0).

### Conclusion:
If `a` has `len(a)` elements, and `v` is even, `cnt` will be `len(a) // 2` because `op` will be 0 exactly half the time due to the even number of 1-bits at position `i`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a non-empty list, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`, `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is 0, `cnt` is `len(a) // 2`.**

In natural language, after all iterations, the variables `n` and `x` remain the same as initially returned by `func_3()`. The list `a` remains unchanged, and `t` stays empty. The variable `u` retains its initial value, and `v` remains the sum of the bits at position `i` of all elements in `a`. The variable `op` ends up being 0, and `cnt` is half the number of elements in `a` because `v` is even.
