The given code snippet appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. The values of `op` and `ai` are updated in the initial state description but are not modified by the provided code snippet. Therefore, the only change is the addition of `ai` to the list `t`.

Output State: **The loop terminates as there are no more elements in `a` after the 30th element; `op` is updated to `op ^ ((val >> i) & 1)`; `ai` is updated to `ai ^ val`; `t` now contains `ai` as its last element.**
