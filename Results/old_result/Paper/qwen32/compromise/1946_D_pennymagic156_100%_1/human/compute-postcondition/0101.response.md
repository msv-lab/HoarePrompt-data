The code snippet provided increments the variable `cnt` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the only change is in the value of `cnt`. Since `cnt` was initially 1 if `op` was 0, and 0 otherwise, after the operation `cnt += 1`, the new value of `cnt` will be 2 if it was initially 1, and 1 if it was initially 0.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a non-empty list, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`, `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `cnt` is 2 if `op` was 0, otherwise `cnt` is 1, `val` is the next element in the list `a`.**
