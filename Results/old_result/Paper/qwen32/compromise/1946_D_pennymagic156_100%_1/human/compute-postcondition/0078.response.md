Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` is a list containing at least one `ai` value where the first `ai` value is now `ai ^ val`. If `op` is 0, `t` contains `ai` and `ai` is set to 0. Otherwise, `t` remains an empty list. `u` equals 0, and `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`. `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`. `val` is the second element of `a`.**
