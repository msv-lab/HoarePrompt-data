The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of the variables or the overall state of the program except for the control flow within the loop.

Given the initial state, none of the variables `n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `i`, `u`, or `v` are modified by the `continue` statement. The loop simply proceeds to its next iteration without making any changes to these variables.

Therefore, the output state remains exactly the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains `ai` values where `op` was 0 during each iteration if `u` equals 0, otherwise `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `t` remains an empty list, `i` is 28, `u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`.**
