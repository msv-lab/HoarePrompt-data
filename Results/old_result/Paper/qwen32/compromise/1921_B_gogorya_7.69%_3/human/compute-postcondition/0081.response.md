Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `s1` and `s2` are the new input strings, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`. If `hd` was originally greater than 0, then `hd` is `hd - 1`, otherwise `hd` remains `a1 - a2`. `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 2` if `s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'`, otherwise `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`. `i` is `i + 1`.**

In natural language: The value of `res` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values or conditions.
