Output State: **t is 0, n is undefined, s1 and s2 are undefined, a1 is undefined, a2 is undefined, hd is undefined, res is undefined.**

### Explanation in Natural Language:
After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop runs `t` times and decrements `t` implicitly with each iteration until it reaches 0. The variables `n`, `s1`, `s2`, `a1`, `a2`, `hd`, and `res` are redefined in each iteration of the loop based on the new inputs, so they do not retain any specific values after the loop completes. Therefore, after the loop finishes, these variables are considered undefined in the context of the overall execution state.
