The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the program state.

Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `s1` is the string input; `s2` is an input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; if `hd` was initially greater than 0, then `hd` is now `a1 - a2 - 3`; otherwise, `hd` is `-1`; if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 2`; otherwise, `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`; `i` is 2.**
