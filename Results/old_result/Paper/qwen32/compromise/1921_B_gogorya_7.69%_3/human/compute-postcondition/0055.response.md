Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `s1` and `s2` are input strings; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1` if `hd` was greater than 0 and `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'`, otherwise `hd` remains `a1 - a2`; `res` is either `abs(a1 - a2) + 1` or `abs(a1 - a2)` based on the condition in the loop body, and `res` is incremented by 1 if `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, all the variables retain their previous values.
