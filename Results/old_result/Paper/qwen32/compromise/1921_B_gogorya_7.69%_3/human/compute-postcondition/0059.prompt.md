Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `s1` is the new input string; `s2` is the new input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in the new `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in the new `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2`; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if hd > 0:
        hd -= 1
        continue
    if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
        res += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `s1` and `s2` are input strings; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`. If at the current index `i`, `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', then `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 1` if `hd` (which is `a1 - a2`) is greater than 0, otherwise `hd` remains `a1 - a2`. `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`. Otherwise, `hd` remains `a1 - a2` and `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `s1` and `s2` are input strings; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` (which is initially `a1 - a2`) is decremented by 1 if `hd` is greater than 0 and `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'`; `res` is either `abs(a1 - a2) + 1` or `abs(a1 - a2)` based on the condition in the loop body, and `res` is incremented by 1 if `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `s1` and `s2` are input strings; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`. If `hd` was greater than 0 and `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'`, then `hd` is decremented by 1 to become `a1 - a2 - 1`, otherwise `hd` remains `a1 - a2`. `res` is either `abs(a1 - a2) + 1` or `abs(a1 - a2)` based on the condition in the loop body. If `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'`, `res` is incremented by 1 to become `res + 1`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
