Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer; `s1` is the new input string; `s2` is the new input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in the new `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2`; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if hd > 0:
        hd -= 1
        continue
    if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
        res += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `s1` and `s2` are the new input strings, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`, `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1` if `hd` was originally greater than 0, otherwise `hd` remains `a1 - a2`, and `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 1` if `s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'`. Otherwise, `res` remains `abs(a1 - a2)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `s1` and `s2` are the new input strings, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`. If `hd` was originally greater than 0, then `hd` is `hd - 1`, otherwise `hd` remains `a1 - a2`. If `s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'`, then `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 2`, otherwise `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`. `i` is `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `s1` and `s2` are the new input strings, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`. If `hd` was originally greater than 0, then `hd` is `hd - 2`, otherwise `hd` remains `a1 - a2`. If `s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'`, then `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 3`, otherwise `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 2`. `i` is `i + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
