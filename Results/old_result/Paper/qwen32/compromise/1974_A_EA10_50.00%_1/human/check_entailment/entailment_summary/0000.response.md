Reasoning:

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of screens required for given numbers of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. Let's break down the issues in the code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The line `z = (y + 1) // 2` is an attempt to calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons. However, it does not correctly account for the fact that each screen can hold a maximum of one 2x2 icon (which occupies 4 cells). Instead, it should simply be `z = y` because each 2x2 icon requires its own screen.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining 1x1 Icons:**
   - The line `m = 15 * z - y * 4` is intended to calculate the remaining 1x1 icon spaces after placing the 2x2 icons. However, the logic here is flawed. It should calculate the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons and then determine how many 1x1 icons can be placed in the remaining cells.

3. **Incorrect Adjustment of Screens for 1x1 Icons:**
   - The conditional statement `if m < a:` is incorrect and does not serve the intended purpose. The correct approach would be to calculate the number of screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons and then summing these screens with the screens used by 2x2 icons.

4. **Inconsistent Use of Variables:**
   - The variable `a` is initially used to store the number of test cases but is incorrectly used in the condition `if m < a:`. This condition is logically flawed and unrelated to the problem's requirements.

Here is a corrected version of the code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        # Each 2x2 icon requires one screen
        screens_for_2x2 = y
        # Calculate remaining slots after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_slots = 15 * screens_for_2x2 - y * 4
        # Calculate additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        additional_screens_for_1x1 = (x - remaining_slots + 14) // 15 if x > remaining_slots else 0
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens_for_1x1
        print(total_screens)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

Given the issues identified, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
