Let's carefully analyze the given program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Provided Program Analysis

Here is the provided program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)
```

### Problem Description Recap

- We need to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons on the minimum number of 5x3 screens.
- Each screen can hold up to 15 icons (5 rows * 3 columns).
- Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, so we need to account for this when placing them.
- The goal is to determine the minimal number of screens needed for each test case.

### Issues in the Provided Program

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `m`**:
    - The variable `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`. This doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.
    - For example, if `y = 1`, then `z = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1`. If `m = 15 * 1 - 1 * 4 = 11`, this doesn't help us determine the remaining space for 1x1 icons.

2. **Incorrect Usage of `a`**:
    - The variable `a` is used as the number of test cases, but it is also used in the condition `if m < a`. This comparison is incorrect and doesn't reflect the logic needed to determine the number of screens.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Placing Icons**:
    - The logic to place 1x1 and 2x2 icons is not correctly implemented.
    - The program does not account for the fact that a 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and it does not correctly calculate the remaining space for 1x1 icons.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 icons (`y`).
2. Calculate the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons.
3. Place the remaining 1x1 icons (`x`) in the available space.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = (y + 2 - 1) // 2  # Ceiling division
        # Calculate the remaining space in these screens
        remaining_space = screens_for_2x2 * 15 - y * 4
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for remaining 1x1 icons
        additional_screens_for_1x1 = (x - remaining_space + 15 - 1) // 15 if x > remaining_space else 0
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens_for_1x1
        print(total_screens)

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of screens required. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
