### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to verify the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the total difference \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \), where \( c_i \) is an array of \( n \) integers chosen from \( m \) available integers \( b_i \) and arranged in any order.

#### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( m \), the lengths of arrays \( a \) and \( b \) respectively.
   - It then reads the arrays \( a \) and \( b \).

2. **Sorting**:
   - The array \( b \) is sorted in ascending order. This helps in efficiently finding the largest and smallest elements of \( b \) to maximize the difference.

3. **Heap Initialization**:
   - A max-heap (implemented using a min-heap with negative values) is used to keep track of the maximum possible differences for each element in \( a \).
   - For each element \( i \) in \( a \), the program calculates the difference with the smallest (\( b[0] \)) and the largest (\( b[m-1] \)) elements of the sorted \( b \).
   - The larger of these two differences is pushed into the heap along with the element and the index of the chosen \( b \) element.

4. **Heap Processing**:
   - The program then processes the heap to calculate the maximum total difference.
   - It pops the largest difference from the heap and checks if the corresponding \( b \) element is still available (i.e., not already used).
   - If the \( b \) element is still available, it adds the difference to the total difference and marks the element as used.
   - If the \( b \) element is already used, it recalculates the difference with the next available smallest or largest element in \( b \) and adds the maximum of these to the total difference.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements in \( a \), the program prints the total maximum difference for the current test case.

### Correctness Verification

The program aims to maximize the total difference \( D \) by always choosing the maximum possible difference for each element in \( a \) and efficiently managing the available elements in \( b \) using a heap. Here's a detailed look at the logic:

- **Heap Initialization**: For each element in \( a \), the program calculates the difference with the smallest and largest elements in \( b \). This ensures that the largest possible initial differences are considered.
- **Heap Processing**: The program uses a greedy approach to always pick the largest available difference. If the chosen \( b \) element is already used, it recalculates the difference with the next available smallest or largest element in \( b \). This ensures that the differences remain maximized even as elements in \( b \) are used up.

### Annotations Review

The annotations describe the program's state at key points, which align with the expected behavior:
- **Sorting \( b \)**: Ensures that the smallest and largest elements are easily accessible.
- **Heap Initialization**: Correctly identifies the largest initial differences for each element in \( a \).
- **Heap Processing**: Correctly recalculates differences and ensures that each element in \( b \) is used at most once.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the maximum total difference \( D \) for each test case.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The program is correct.
