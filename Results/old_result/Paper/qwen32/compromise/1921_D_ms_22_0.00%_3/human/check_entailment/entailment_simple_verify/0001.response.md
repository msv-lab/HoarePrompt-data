### Reasoning

To verify the correctness of the program, let's analyze its logic and behavior step by step using the annotated code and the problem description.

#### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the total difference \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \) where \( c_i \) is an array of \( n \) integers chosen from \( m \) available integers \( b_i \) and arranged in any order.

#### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
    - The program reads the number of test cases.
    - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( m \), the lengths of arrays \( a \) and \( b \) respectively.
    - It then reads the arrays \( a \) and \( b \).

2. **Sorting**:
    - The array \( b \) is sorted in ascending order. This helps in efficiently finding the largest and smallest elements of \( b \) to maximize the difference.

3. **Heap Initialization**:
    - A max-heap (implemented using a min-heap with negative values) is used to keep track of the maximum possible differences for each element in \( a \).
    - For each element \( i \) in \( a \), the program calculates the difference with the smallest (\( b[0] \)) and the largest (\( b[m-1] \)) elements of the sorted \( b \).
    - The larger of these two differences is pushed into the heap along with the element and the index of the chosen \( b \) element.

4. **Heap Processing**:
    - The program then processes the heap to calculate the maximum total difference.
    - It pops the largest difference from the heap and checks if the corresponding \( b \) element is still available (i.e., not already used).
    - If the \( b \) element is still available, it adds the difference to the total difference and marks the element as used.
    - If the \( b \) element is already used, it recalculates the difference with the next available smallest or largest element in \( b \) and adds the maximum of these to the total difference.

5. **Output**:
    - After processing all elements in \( a \), the program prints the total maximum difference for the current test case.

#### Correctness Verification

The program's approach is to maximize the difference for each element in \( a \) by choosing the most distant possible element from \( b \) (either the smallest or the largest). This is a greedy strategy that ensures the maximum possible difference for each element.

Here are some key points to validate the program:

- **Sorting \( b \)**: Sorting \( b \) allows us to easily access the smallest and largest elements, which are crucial for maximizing the difference.
- **Heap Usage**: The heap ensures that we always consider the maximum possible difference first, which is essential for maximizing the total difference.
- **Element Availability**: The program keeps track of which elements in \( b \) have already been used, ensuring that each element in \( c \) is chosen from \( b \) without repetition.

The annotated code provides a clear state of the program at various points, which supports the correctness of the approach:

- **Initialization**: Before the function call, the program correctly reads the inputs and initializes necessary variables.
- **Heap Population**: The heap is populated with the maximum possible differences for each element in \( a \).
- **Heap Processing**: The heap is processed to calculate the maximum total difference, ensuring that each element in \( a \) is paired with the most distant element in \( b \).

#### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the maximum total difference \( D \) for each test case using a combination of sorting, heap usage, and greedy selection.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: True**
