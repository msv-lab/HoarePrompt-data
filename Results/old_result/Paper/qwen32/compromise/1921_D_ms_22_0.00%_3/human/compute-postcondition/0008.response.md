The code provided initializes an empty list named `max_heap`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, or `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` is an empty list.**
