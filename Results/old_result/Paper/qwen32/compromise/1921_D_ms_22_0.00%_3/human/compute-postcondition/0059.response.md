Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is an integer obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)` for each element `i` in `a`, with one element removed; `item` is the tuple with the largest `diff` value from the original `max_heap`; `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`; `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`; `tp2` is decreased by 1.** 

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an input integer between 0 and 99 inclusive; `n` remains greater than 0; `m` and the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged; `max_heap` and `item` remain unchanged; `diff1` and `diff2` remain as they were calculated before; `tp2` is now one less than its previous value.
