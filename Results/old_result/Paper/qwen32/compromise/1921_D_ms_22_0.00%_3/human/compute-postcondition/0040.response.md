Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is an integer obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)` for each element `i` in `a`, with one element removed; `tp1` is 1; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is `diff1`; `item` is the tuple with the largest `diff` value from the original `max_heap`; the current `item[2]` (index) is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`; `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`; `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`; `diff1` is greater than `diff2`.**

In simple terms, the value of `ans` has been updated to be equal to `diff1`, which is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`. All other variables retain their previous values.
