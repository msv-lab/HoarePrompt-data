The code snippet adds a tuple to the `max_heap` list using the `heapq.heappush` function. The tuple contains three elements: `-diff1`, `i`, and `0`. The value of `diff1` is already specified as `abs(i - b[0])`.

Given that `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, and knowing the structure of the heap, `-diff1` will be a negative number with a larger absolute value than `-diff2`, placing this tuple at the top of the heap if it were to be compared with other tuples.

Here is the updated state of the variables after the code execution:

- `t` remains `t - 1`
- `n` remains the first integer from the input
- `m` remains the second integer from the input
- `a` remains a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must have at least one integer
- `b` remains a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input
- `max_heap` now contains the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`
- `tp1` remains 0
- `tp2` remains `m - 1`
- `ans` remains 0
- `diff1` remains `abs(i - b[0])`
- `diff2` remains `abs(i - b[m - 1])`

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must have at least one integer, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `max_heap` is `[(-diff1, i, 0)]`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`**
