Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must have at least one integer, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the next element in `a`, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1 > diff2`; otherwise, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`.**
