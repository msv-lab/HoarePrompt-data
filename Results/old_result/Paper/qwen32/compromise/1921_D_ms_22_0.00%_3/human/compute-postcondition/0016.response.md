The code snippet pushes a tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` onto the `max_heap` list, which is used as a max-heap by storing negative values. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and must have at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` is a list containing the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0; `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`; `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`; `diff1` is greater than `diff2`.**
