The code snippet assigns the value of `m - 1` to the variable `tp2`. No other variables are affected by this operation. The initial state specifies that `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, `max_heap` is an empty list, and `tp1` is 0. After executing the code, `tp2` takes on the value of `m - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `max_heap` is an empty list; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`.**
