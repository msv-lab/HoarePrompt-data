The code snippet updates the value of `diff1` to be the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of the sorted list `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must have at least one integer, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `max_heap` is `[(-diff1, i, 0)]`. Otherwise, `max_heap` is `[(-diff2, i, m - 1)]` and `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`.**
