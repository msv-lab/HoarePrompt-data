The code snippet takes an input line, splits it into two parts, converts each part into an integer, and assigns these integers to `n` and `m` respectively. The initial state only specifies the value of `t`, which remains unchanged. Therefore, `t` still holds its initial value, and `n` and `m` are assigned the new integer values from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the split input**.
