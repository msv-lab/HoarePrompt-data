Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must contain at least one element, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple, `item` is the tuple with the smallest absolute difference that was popped from `max_heap`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`, `tp2` is `tp2 - 1`, `ans` is `ans + diff2`.**

In simple terms, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the value of `diff2`. All other variables retain their previous values.
