Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and must have at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` is an empty list; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0; `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`; `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`; `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`**
