The code snippet `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `max_heap`, which is a min-heap due to the negative values used for the heap keys.

Given that `max_heap` contains tuples of the form `(-diff1, i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, the element with the smallest key (which is the largest absolute `diff` value) will be popped. Let's denote the popped item as `item`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must contain at least one element, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `max_heap` is a list containing tuples `(-diff1, i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` for each element in `a` except the one popped, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `item` is the tuple with the largest absolute difference that was popped from `max_heap`.**

In simpler terms, the heap `max_heap` loses one element, which is the one with the largest absolute difference, and this element is stored in the variable `item`. All other variables remain unchanged.
