The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of the sorted list `b`, and assigns this value to `diff2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and `m` is the second integer from the input, `b[m - 1]` refers to the last element of the list `b`. The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, so we assume it is a given integer for the calculation of `diff2`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must have at least one integer, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`**.
