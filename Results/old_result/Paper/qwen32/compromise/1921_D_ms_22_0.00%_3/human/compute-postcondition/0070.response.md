Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is an integer obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` contains at least one element but does not include the tuple with the largest `diff` value from the original `max_heap`; `item` is the tuple with the smallest `diff` value from the original `max_heap`; `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`; `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`.**

In this output state, all variables retain their original properties and values except for the new variable `diff2`, which is calculated as the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the element at index `tp2` in the sorted list `b`.
