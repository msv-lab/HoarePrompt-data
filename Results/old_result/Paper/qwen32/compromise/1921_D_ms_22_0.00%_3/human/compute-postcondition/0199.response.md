The given code calculates `diff2` as the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. No other variables are directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `max_heap` contains `n-1` tuples of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)`; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0; `item` is the tuple with the largest `max_diff` value from the original `max_heap`. The current `item[2]` (index_in_b) is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`; `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`; `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is: `t` remains greater than 0, `n` and `m` remain the same, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `max_heap` remains unchanged, `tp1` and `tp2` remain unchanged, `ans` remains 0, `item` remains the same, `diff1` remains the same, and `diff2` is now calculated as `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`.
