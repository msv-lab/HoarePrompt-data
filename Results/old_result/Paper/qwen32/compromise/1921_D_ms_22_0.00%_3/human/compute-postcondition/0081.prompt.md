Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)` for each element `i` in `a`, where `diff` is the larger of `abs(i - b[0])` and `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `index` is `0` if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, otherwise `m - 1`; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0. `diff1` and `diff2` are not explicitly tracked but are used to determine the contents of `max_heap`.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is an integer obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)` for each element `i` in `a`, with one element removed; `item` is the tuple with the largest `diff` value from the original `max_heap`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])` and `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `tp1` is set to 1, `tp2` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is set to `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 2`, and `ans` is set to `diff2`. If `item[2]` is not less than `tp1` and not greater than `tp2`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `diff`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, `tp1` is set to 1 and `tp2` is set to `m - 1`. Otherwise, `tp1` remains 0 and `tp2` is set to `m - 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is an integer obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)` for each element `i` in `a`, with one element removed; `item` is the tuple with the largest `diff` value from the original `max_heap`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])` and `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is not less than `tp1` and not greater than `tp2`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `diff`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is the original value of `tp1` plus 1, otherwise `tp1` is unchanged. If `item[2]` does not equal `tp1`, `tp2` is the original value of `tp2` minus 1, otherwise `tp2` is unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is an integer obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` contains at least one element but does not include the tuple with the largest `diff` value from the original `max_heap`; `item` is the tuple with the smallest `diff` value from the original `max_heap`. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, then `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])` and `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is updated to `ans + diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, `ans` is updated by subtracting the first element of `item`. If `item[2] == tp1`, `tp1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
