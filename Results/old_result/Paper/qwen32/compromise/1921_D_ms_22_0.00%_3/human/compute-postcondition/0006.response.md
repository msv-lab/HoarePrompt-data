The code snippet reads a new line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `b`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the split input.**
