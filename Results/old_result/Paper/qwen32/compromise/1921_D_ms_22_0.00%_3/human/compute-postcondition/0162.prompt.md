Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `max_heap` is a list containing tuples `(-diff1, i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` for each element in `a`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must contain at least one element, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `max_heap` is a list containing tuples `(-diff1, i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` for each element in `a` except the one popped, `item` is the tuple with the largest absolute difference that was popped from `max_heap`. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, then `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, then `tp1` is 1, `tp2` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 2`, and `ans` is `ans + diff2`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1` (which is 0), then `tp1` is updated to 1. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp2` (which is `m - 1`), then `tp2` is updated to `m - 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is the largest absolute difference from the popped tuple.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must contain at least one element, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple, `item` is the tuple with the largest absolute difference that was popped from `max_heap`. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, then `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. If `diff1 > diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1` or `tp2`, then `ans` is `ans - item[0]`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, `tp1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must contain at least one element, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple, `item` is the tuple with the smallest absolute difference that was popped from `max_heap`. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, then `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `tp1` is `tp1 + 1` and `ans` is `ans + diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is `tp2 - 1` and `ans` is `ans + diff2`. If `item[2]` is not less than `tp1` and not greater than `tp2`, then `ans` is `ans - item[0]`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, no further changes are made. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
