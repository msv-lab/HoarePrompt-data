Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `max_heap` contains `n-1` tuples of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)`; `tp1` is 1; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is the original `ans` plus `max_diff`; `item` is the tuple with the largest `max_diff` value from the original `max_heap`. Additionally, `item[2]` is equal to `tp1 - 1`.**

Natural Language: The value of `tp1` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged, including the condition that `t` is greater than 0, the values of `n` and `m`, the lists `a` and `b`, the `max_heap`, `tp2`, `ans`, and `item`. The relationship between `item[2]` and `tp1` is updated to reflect that `item[2]` is now equal to `tp1 - 1`.
