Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the next element in the list `a` (i.e., the element after the current `i`), `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `max_heap` includes the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`. Otherwise, `max_heap` includes the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`**
