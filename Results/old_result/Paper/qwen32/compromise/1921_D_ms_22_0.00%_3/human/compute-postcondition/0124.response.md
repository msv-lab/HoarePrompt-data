The code snippet `ans += diff2` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `diff2`. None of the other variables are changed by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must contain at least one element, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `max_heap` is a list containing tuples `(-diff1, i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` for each element in `a` except the one popped, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 2`, `ans` is `ans + diff2`, `item` is the tuple with the largest absolute difference that was popped from `max_heap`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2 + 1])`, and `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`**.
