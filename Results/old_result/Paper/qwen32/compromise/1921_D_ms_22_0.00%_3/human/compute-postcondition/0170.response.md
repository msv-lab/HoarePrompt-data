The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `max_heap`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, the initial conditions for these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `max_heap` is an empty list.**
