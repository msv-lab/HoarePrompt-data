Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `max_heap` contains `n-1` tuples of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)`; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0; `item` is the tuple with the largest `max_diff` value from the original `max_heap`. The current `item[2]` (index_in_b) is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`.**
