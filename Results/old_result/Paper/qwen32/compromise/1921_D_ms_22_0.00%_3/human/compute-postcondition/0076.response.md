The code snippet `ans += -item[0]` modifies the value of `ans` by subtracting the first element of the tuple `item`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `item` is the tuple with the smallest `diff` value from the original `max_heap`, and `item[0]` is the first element of this tuple, the value of `ans` will be updated accordingly.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is an integer obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` contains at least one element but does not include the tuple with the largest `diff` value from the original `max_heap`; `item` is the tuple with the smallest `diff` value from the original `max_heap`; `ans` is updated by subtracting the first element of `item`.**
