The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `t`. The initial state does not specify the values of `n` and `t`, so after the execution of the code, `n` and `t` will hold the values provided by the input. The other variables (`nodes` and `start`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node and the value is a list of integers representing the neighboring nodes; `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game, such that 1 <= start <= n; `n` is the first integer from the input; `t` is the second integer from the input.**
