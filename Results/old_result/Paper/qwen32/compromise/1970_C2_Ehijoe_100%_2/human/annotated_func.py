    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether any element in the `distances` list is `True`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` determines whether there is a cycle in a tree structure represented by the `nodes` dictionary starting from the `start` node, excluding the `parent` node. It returns `False` if the current node has only one neighbor which is the parent, indicating a leaf node or a single connection back to the parent. Otherwise, it recursively checks the neighbors and returns `True` if any of them form a cycle.

If `moves` is truthy (i.e., not empty or zero), the program proceeds accordingly. If `moves` is `False`, the program also proceeds accordingly with `moves` being `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input to construct a graph represented by a dictionary of nodes and their neighbors, identifies leaf nodes, and determines the starting node. It then calls another function `func_1` to process the graph starting from the given node. Based on the result from `func_1`, it prints either "Ron" or "Hermione".
