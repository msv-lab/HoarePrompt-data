You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to verify its correctness based on the problem description.

### Analysis of the Code

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it processes a series of constraints and determines the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `cx`: A set to store all integers that `k` must not be equal to.
   - `ax`: Initialized to a large value (`1000000000 + 7`) to represent the upper bound.
   - `bx`: Initialized to a small value (`-1`) to represent the lower bound.

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint:
     - If the constraint type is `1` (k must be greater than or equal to x), update `bx` to the maximum of `x` and the current `bx`.
     - If the constraint type is `2` (k must be less than or equal to x), update `ax` to the minimum of `x` and the current `ax`.
     - If the constraint type is `3` (k must not be equal to x), add `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Checking Validity**:
   - If `bx` (lower bound) is greater than `ax` (upper bound), it means there are no valid integers `k` that can satisfy all constraints, so the result is `0`.
   - Otherwise, calculate the number of valid integers `k` in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in the set `cx`.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, append the result to the list `r` and finally print all results.

### Verification

The code appears to handle all the required cases as per the problem description. Here are the key points to verify:

- **Initialization**: The initial values for `ax` and `bx` ensure that they cover the entire range of possible integers initially.
- **Constraint Processing**: The logic correctly updates the bounds and records the excluded integers.
- **Range Calculation**: The calculation `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` correctly computes the number of valid integers `k` after excluding those in `cx`.

### Edge Cases
- **No Valid Range**: If `bx` exceeds `ax` after processing the constraints, the code correctly returns `0`.
- **No Excluded Integers**: If there are no constraints of type `3`, the code correctly computes the entire range.
- **All Excluded Integers in Range**: If all integers in the range `[bx, ax]` are excluded, the result should be `0`.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the code and considering the problem description and potential edge cases, it seems that the program correctly handles all scenarios described.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly processes the constraints, updates the bounds, and calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. It handles edge cases where there are no valid integers or all integers in the range are excluded.
