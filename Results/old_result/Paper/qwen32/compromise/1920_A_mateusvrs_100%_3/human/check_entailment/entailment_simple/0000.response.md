### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the logic and verify if it correctly handles all the constraints:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `t` is read to determine the number of test cases.
   - `r` is an empty list that will store the results for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, `n` is read to determine the number of constraints.
   - `cx` is a set that will store the values of `x` for constraints of type 3 (k must be not equal to x).
   - `ax` is initialized to a very large value (1000000000 + 7) to find the minimum value for constraints of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x).
   - `bx` is initialized to -1 to find the maximum value for constraints of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x).

3. **Processing Each Constraint:**
   - For each constraint, the type `a` and value `x` are read.
   - If `a` is 1, `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
   - If `a` is 2, `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
   - If `a` is 3, `x` is added to the set `cx`.

4. **Calculating the Number of Valid `k` Values:**
   - If `bx` is greater than `ax`, it means the constraints are contradictory (e.g., `k >= 5` and `k <= 4`), so the result for this test case is 0.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the total number of integers between `bx` and `ax` inclusive and subtracts the number of integers in `cx` that fall within this range. This is done by iterating over `cx` and counting how many of these values are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive. The result is then `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.

5. **Output:**
   - The results for all test cases are printed, one per line.

### Verification with Example Input:
Let's verify the program with the first test case from the example:

**Input:**
```
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```

**Execution:**
- `bx` becomes 3 (from the first constraint).
- `ax` becomes 10 (from the second constraint).
- `cx` becomes {1, 5} (from the third and fourth constraints).
- Since `bx` (3) is not greater than `ax` (10), the program calculates the number of valid `k` values:
  - Total possible `k` values: `ax - bx + 1 = 10 - 3 + 1 = 8` (i.e., 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
  - Invalid `k` values (in `cx`): 2 (i.e., 1 and 5).
  - Valid `k` values: `8 - 2 = 6` (i.e., 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).

The program correctly calculates the result as 7, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all the given constraints for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
