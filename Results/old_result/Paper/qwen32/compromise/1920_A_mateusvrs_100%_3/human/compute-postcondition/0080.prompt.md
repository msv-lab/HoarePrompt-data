Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 1; `r` is a list with an additional element appended to it. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, the additional element is `0`. Otherwise, the additional element is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`; `n` is an input integer; `cx` is an empty set; `ax` is `1000000007`; `bx` is `-1`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    a, x = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 1:
        bx = max(x, bx)
    elif a == 2:
        ax = min(x, ax)
    else:
        cx.add(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 1, `r` is a list with an additional element appended to it, `n` is greater than 0, `ax` is 1000000007, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` is not 1, `bx` is -1. If `a` is 2, `ax` is set to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. Otherwise, `cx` is a set containing `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 1, `r` is a list with an additional element appended to it, `n` is greater than 1, `ax` is 1000000007, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` is not 1, `bx` is -1. If `a` is 2, `ax` is set to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. Otherwise, `cx` is a set containing `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 1, `r` is a list with an additional element appended to it, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input. If `a` is equal to 1, then `bx` is the maximum of its previous value and `x`. If `a` is equal to 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. Otherwise, `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` contains all its previous elements plus `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
