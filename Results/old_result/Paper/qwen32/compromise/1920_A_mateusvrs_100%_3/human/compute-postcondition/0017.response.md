Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `ax` is 1000000007, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `1000000007`. If `a` is not equal to 1 or 2, then `cx` is a set containing `x`.**
