`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables `t`, `r`, `bx`, `ax`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 1; `r` is a list with an additional element appended to it. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, the additional element is `0`. Otherwise, the additional element is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`; `n` is an input integer.**
