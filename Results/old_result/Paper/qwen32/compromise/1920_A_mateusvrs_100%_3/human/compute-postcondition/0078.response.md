Postcondition: **`t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 1, `r` is a list with an additional element appended to it, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input. If `a` is equal to 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. Otherwise, `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` contains all its previous elements plus `x`.**
