Postcondition: **`t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 2, `r` is a list with `n` additional elements appended to it, `n` is 0, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing at least one element (e.g., `cx` contains `x` where `a` is neither 1 nor 2 and there is at least one such `x`), `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is 0, and `i` is a value such that `bx <= i <= ax`.**
