The code snippet `a, x = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`. This means that the values of `a` and `x` will be updated based on the input provided.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 2.
- `r` is a list with `n` additional elements appended to it.
- `n` is now `n+1`.
- `ax` is 1000000007.
- `a` is the first integer input.
- `x` is the second integer input.
- If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1.
- If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007.
- Otherwise, `cx` is a set containing the element `x` and possibly other elements, including `x`.

After the code snippet is executed, `a` and `x` will be updated to the values provided by the input. The other variables (`t`, `r`, `n`, `ax`, `bx`, `cx`) remain unchanged unless `a` is 1 or 2, which would affect `bx` or `ax` respectively.

Output State: **`t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 2, `r` is a list with `n` additional elements appended to it, `n` is now `n+1`, `ax` is 1000000007, `a` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. Otherwise, `cx` is a set containing the element `x` and possibly other elements, including `x`.**
