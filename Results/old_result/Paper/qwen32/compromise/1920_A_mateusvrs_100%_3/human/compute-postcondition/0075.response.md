The code snippet `bx = max(x, bx)` updates the value of `bx` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `x`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 1
- `r` is a list with an additional element appended to it
- `n` is greater than 0
- `ax` is 1000000007
- `a` is the first integer from the input
- `x` is the second integer from the input

After the code execution, the value of `bx` will be the maximum of its previous value and `x`.

Output State: **`t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 1, `r` is a list with an additional element appended to it, `n` is greater than 0, `ax` is 1000000007, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `bx` is the maximum of its previous value and `x`.**
