Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is not equal to 1 or 2, then `cx` is a set containing `x`. Additionally, if `a` is 2, `ax` is updated to be the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `cx` now contains `x`.**
