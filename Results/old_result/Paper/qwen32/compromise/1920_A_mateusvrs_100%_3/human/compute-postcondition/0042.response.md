The code snippet `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. Given the initial state, `tmp` is initially 1 if `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`, otherwise `tmp` is 0. After the increment, `tmp` will be 2 if `i` was initially within the range, or `tmp` will be 1 if it was initially 0.

Output State: **`t`, `bx`, and `ax` are as described in the precondition; `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`; `tmp` is 2 if `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `tmp` is 1; `cx` must be an iterable with at least two elements; `i` is the second element of `cx`.**
