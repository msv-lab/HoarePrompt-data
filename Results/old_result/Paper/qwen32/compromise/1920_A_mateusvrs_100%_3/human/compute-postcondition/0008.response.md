The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x` respectively. The other variables (`t`, `r`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, and `bx`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer.**
