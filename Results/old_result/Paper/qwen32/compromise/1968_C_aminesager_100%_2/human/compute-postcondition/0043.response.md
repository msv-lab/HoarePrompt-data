To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior and how it evolves with each iteration.

### Loop Analysis:
- **Initial State:**
  - `n`: The new input integer.
  - `t`: `t + n - 2`.
  - `x`: A list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500`.
  - `T`: A list of integers derived from splitting and converting the new `line`.
  - `a`: A list containing the single element `[1000]`.
  - `result`: A string formed by joining the elements of `a` with spaces.
  - `line`: The new input string.

- **Loop Code:**
  ```python
  for i in range(1, n):
      a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
  ```

- **Loop Iteration Details:**
  - **First Iteration (`i = 1`):** 
    - `a` becomes `[1000, 1000 + T[0]]`.
  - **Second Iteration (`i = 2`):**
    - `a` becomes `[1000, 1000 + T[0], (1000 + T[0]) + T[1]]`.
  - **Third Iteration (`i = 3`):**
    - `a` becomes `[1000, 1000 + T[0], (1000 + T[0]) + T[1], ((1000 + T[0]) + T[1]) + T[2]]`.

### General Pattern:
- For each iteration `i` from `1` to `n-1`, the loop appends a new element to `a` which is the sum of the previous element of `a` and `T[i-1]`.

- **Final State of `a` after all iterations:**
  - `a` will have `n` elements.
  - The first element is `1000`.
  - Each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of `1000` and the first `i-1` elements of `T`.

### Final Output State:
- The loop runs `n-1` times, so after the loop completes, `a` will contain `n` elements.
- The `result` variable is not updated within the loop, so it remains as the initial string formed by joining the elements of `a` with spaces.

### Conclusion:
The final output state of the variables involved in the loop is:
- `a` will be a list of `n` elements where the first element is `1000` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of `1000` and the elements of `T` up to that point.
- `result` remains unchanged and is still the string `"1000"`.

Output State: **`a` is a list with `n` elements where the first element is `1000` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of `1000` and the elements of `T` up to that point; `result` is `"1000"`.**
