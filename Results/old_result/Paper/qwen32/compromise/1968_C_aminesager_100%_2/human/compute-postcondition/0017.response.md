Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` remains the same input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500; `x` remains the same list of n-1 integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500; `T` remains the same list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`; `a` remains a list containing the elements `[1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]]`; `result` is a string formed by joining the elements of `a` with spaces.**

In natural language: The value of `t` is decreased by 1. All other variables (`n`, `x`, `T`, `a`, and `result`) remain unchanged.
