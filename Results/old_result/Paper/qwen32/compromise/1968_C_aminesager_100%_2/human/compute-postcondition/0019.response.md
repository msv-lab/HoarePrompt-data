The code snippet provided is:
```
line = input('')
```
This line of code takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `line`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the variable `line` is not defined, and the input operation will define it. The other variables `t`, `n`, `x`, `T`, `a`, and `result` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` remains the same input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500; `x` remains the same list of n-1 integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500; `T` remains the same list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`; `a` remains a list containing the elements `[1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]]`; `result` is a string formed by joining the elements of `a` with spaces; `line` is the input string.**
