The code appends the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `T[i - 1]` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is incremented by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i`, the value of `a` changes by having a new element added to it, which is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `T`.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than `i`, `a` has a new element appended which is `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`.**
