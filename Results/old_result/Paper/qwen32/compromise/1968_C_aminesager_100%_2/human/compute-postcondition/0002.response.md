Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, and `x` is a list of n-1 integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Natural Language: The value of `t` has been decremented by 1. The constraints on `t`, `n`, and `x` remain the same as in the initial state.
