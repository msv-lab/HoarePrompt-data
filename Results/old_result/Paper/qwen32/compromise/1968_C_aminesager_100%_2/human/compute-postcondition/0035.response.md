The code snippet updates the list `T` by splitting the new input string `line` and converting each split element to an integer. The values of `n`, `t`, `x`, `a`, `result`, and the previous `line` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the new input integer; `t` is `t + n - 2`; `x` remains the same list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500`; `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the new `line`; `a` is a list containing the elements `[1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[i-1]]` for all `1 <= i <= n-1`; `result` is a string formed by joining the elements of `a` with spaces; `line` is the new input string.**
