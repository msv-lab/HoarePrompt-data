Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, and `x` is a list of n-1 integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of an integer input, which represents the number of test cases. The preconditions for `n` and `x` remain unchanged as they are described in the context of each test case, which has not been processed yet.
