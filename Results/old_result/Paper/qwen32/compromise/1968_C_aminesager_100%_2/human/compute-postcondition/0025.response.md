Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` remains the same input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `x` remains the same list of n-1 integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is a list containing the elements `[1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[i-1]]` up to the length of `T`, `result` is a string formed by joining the elements of `a` with spaces, `line` is the input string.**

In simpler terms: The variable `a` has been updated to include an additional element which is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `T`. All other variables remain unchanged.
