You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [1000]
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. For each test case, it calculates a new list `a` such that each element `a[i]` is the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]` from the input list, starting with `a[0]` initialized to 1000. It then prints the resulting list `a` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

We need to find an array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) such that:
1. \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \) for all \( 1 \leq i \leq n \).
2. \( x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \).

Given:
- \( t \) test cases.
- Each test case has an integer \( n \) (the length of array \( a \)).
- Next, we have \( n-1 \) integers \( x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n \).

The output for each test case should be an array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) that satisfies the given conditions.

### Program Analysis

The program provided is as follows:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [1000]
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)
```

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \).
   - It then reads the \( n-1 \) integers \( x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n \) into the list \( T \).

2. **Array Construction**:
   - It initializes the array \( a \) with the first element \( a_1 = 1000 \).
   - For each subsequent element \( a_i \) (for \( i \) from 2 to \( n \)), it sets \( a_i = a_{i-1} + T[i-1] \).

3. **Output**:
   - It prints the array \( a \) as a space-separated string.

### Evaluation

Let's check if the program satisfies the problem's requirements:

- **Condition \( a_i \mod a_{i-1} = x_i \)**:
  - For \( i = 2 \), \( a_2 = a_1 + T[0] = 1000 + x_2 \). Then, \( a_2 \mod a_1 = (1000 + x_2) \mod 1000 = x_2 \).
  - For \( i = 3 \), \( a_3 = a_2 + T[1] = (1000 + x_2) + x_3 \). Then, \( a_3 \mod a_2 = ((1000 + x_2) + x_3) \mod (1000 + x_2) = x_3 \).
  - This pattern continues for all \( i \), ensuring that \( a_i \mod a_{i-1} = x_i \).

- **Range Condition \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \)**:
  - The initial value \( a_1 = 1000 \) satisfies the range.
  - Each subsequent \( a_i \) is constructed by adding non-negative integers (from \( T \)), so it will always be greater than or equal to 1000.
  - Given the constraints \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \) and \( n \leq 500 \), the maximum possible value for \( a_n \) is \( 1000 + 500 \times 499 = 249500 \), which is well within the \( 10^9 \) limit.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly constructs an array \( a \) that satisfies the given conditions for each test case.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
