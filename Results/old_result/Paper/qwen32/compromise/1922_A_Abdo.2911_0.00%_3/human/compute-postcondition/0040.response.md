Output State: **`t` is a specific integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `template` is a list containing `n` characters, `i` is `i + 1`, `match_a_b` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `template`, `i`, and `match_a_b` remain unchanged, except for the fact that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
