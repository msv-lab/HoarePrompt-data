Postcondition: **`match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is True, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the input string with leading/trailing whitespace removed, `b` is the input string with leading/trailing whitespace removed, `c` is the input string with leading/trailing whitespace removed. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `template` is a list containing `a[i]` at the last position. Otherwise, `template` is a list containing the uppercase version of `a[i]`.**
