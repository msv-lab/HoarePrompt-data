Postcondition: **`match_a_b` will be False if any of the conditions mentioned above are met at any iteration. Otherwise, it will remain True; `match_c` is False if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, otherwise `match_c` remains True; `t` is greater than 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input strings with leading/trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) up to the nth character; `i` is 0; the current character in `template` at index `i` is lowercase. If `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
