Postcondition: **`match_a_b` is `True` if none of the conditions to set it to `False` were met during any iteration; otherwise, `match_a_b` is `False`; `match_c` is `True`; `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, the character at index `i` of `template` is not a lowercase letter, and the lowercase version of the character at index `i` of `c` is equal to the lowercase version of the character at index `i` of `template`.**
