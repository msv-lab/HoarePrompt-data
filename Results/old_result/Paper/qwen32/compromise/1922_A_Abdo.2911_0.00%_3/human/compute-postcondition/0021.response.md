Output State: **`t` is a specific integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, and `template` is a list containing `n` characters. Each character in `template` is either the corresponding character from `a` if it matches the character in `b` at the same position, or the uppercase version of the character from `a` if it does not match.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes executing all `n` iterations, `template` will be a list of `n` characters. Each character in this list is derived from the corresponding character in string `a`. If the character in `a` matches the character in `b` at the same position, it is added to `template` as is. If they do not match, the character from `a` is converted to uppercase and added to `template`.
