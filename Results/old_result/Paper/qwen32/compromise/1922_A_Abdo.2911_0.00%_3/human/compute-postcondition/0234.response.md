The code snippet provided is:
```
match_c = False
```
This line of code sets the variable `match_c` to `False`. None of the other variables (`template`, `i`, `c`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`template` is a list, `i` is an index within the bounds of `template`, and the element at index `i` in `template` is not a lowercase letter. Additionally, the element at index `i` in `c` is equal to the element at index `i` in `template` when both are converted to lowercase. `match_c` is False.**
