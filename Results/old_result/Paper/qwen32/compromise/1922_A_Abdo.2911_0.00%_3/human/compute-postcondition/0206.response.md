Postcondition: **`template` is a list of `n` elements where each element is either the character from `a` or the uppercase version of the character from `a`, based on whether it matched `b` at that position; `match_a_b` is False if either `a[i]` or `b[i]` (or both) match `template[i]` when compared in a case-insensitive manner; `n` must be greater than 0; `template[i]` is an uppercase character. If neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]` match `template[i]` when compared in a case-insensitive manner, `match_a_b` remains True.**
