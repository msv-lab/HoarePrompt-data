Postcondition: **`t` is a specific integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, and `template` has an additional character. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `template` includes the character `a[i]`. Otherwise, `template` includes the uppercase version of `a[i]`.**
