Postcondition: **`match_a_b` is `False` if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`; otherwise, `match_a_b` retains its original value. `match_c` remains `True`. `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the character at index `i` of `template` is a lowercase letter. If `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, the loop or if statement is exited.**
