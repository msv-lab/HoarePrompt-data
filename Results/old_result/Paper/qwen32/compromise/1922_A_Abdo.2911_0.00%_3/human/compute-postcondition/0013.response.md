The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is a specific integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `n` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Given that `i` was at the value `t` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `t + 1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is a specific integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `template` is a list containing the character `a[i]`. Otherwise, `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `template` is a list containing the uppercase version of `a[i]`.**
