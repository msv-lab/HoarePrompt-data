The code snippet `template.append(a[i])` appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the list `template`. Given the initial state, `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` for all valid `i`. However, the specific value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine which character exactly is appended. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a specific integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, and `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`. `c` is the new string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `template` is a list containing the character `a[i]`.**
