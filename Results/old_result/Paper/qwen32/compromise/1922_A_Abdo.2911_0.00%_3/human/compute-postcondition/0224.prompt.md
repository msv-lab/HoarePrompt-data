Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `template` is a list of `n` elements where each element is either the character from `a` or the uppercase version of the character from `a`, based on whether it matched `b` at that position; `match_a_b` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
            match_a_b = False
            break
    elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
        ].lower():
        match_a_b = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `template` is a list of `n` elements where each element is either the character from `a` or the uppercase version of the character from `a`, based on whether it matched `b` at that position; `n` must be greater than 0. If `template[i]` is lowercase and either `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` is set to False. If `template[i]` is uppercase and neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]` match `template[i]` when compared in a case-insensitive manner, `match_a_b` remains True. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `template` is a list of `n` elements where each element is either the character from `a` or the uppercase version of the character from `a`, based on whether it matched `b` at that position; `n` must be greater than 0. If `template[i]` is lowercase and either `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` is set to False. If `template[i]` is uppercase and neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]` match `template[i]` when compared in a case-insensitive manner, `match_a_b` remains True. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains True; `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4. If `template[i]` is lowercase and `a[i]` or `b[i]` does not match `template[i]`, or if `template[i]` is uppercase and neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]` match `template[i]` in a case-insensitive manner, `match_a_b` is set to False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `template` is a list of `n` elements where each element is either the character from `a` or the uppercase version of the character from `a`, based on whether it matched `b` at that position; `n` must be greater than 0. `i` is 5, and `n` must be greater than 4. If `template[i]` is lowercase and either `a[i]` or `b[i]` does not match `template[i]`, or if `template[i]` is uppercase and neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]` match `template[i]` in a case-insensitive manner, `match_a_b` is set to False. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
