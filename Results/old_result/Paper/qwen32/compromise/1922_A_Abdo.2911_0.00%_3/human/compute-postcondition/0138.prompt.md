Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is True, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the input string with leading/trailing whitespace removed, `b` is the input string with leading/trailing whitespace removed, `c` is the input string with leading/trailing whitespace removed, and `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) up to the nth character.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
            match_a_b = False
            break
    elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
        ].lower():
        match_a_b = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `match_a_b` is False if either `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` when `template[i]` is lowercase, or if `a[i].lower() == template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower() == template[i].lower()` when `template[i]` is not lowercase. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains True. `match_c` is True, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input strings with leading/trailing whitespace removed, `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) up to the nth character, and `i` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `match_a_b` is False if `template[i].islower()` and either `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. If `template[i]` is not lowercase, `match_a_b` is False. `match_c` is True, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input strings with leading/trailing whitespace removed, `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) up to the nth character, and `i` is 1. If `template[i]` is not lowercase and either `a[i].lower() == template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `match_a_b` is False if `template[i].islower()` and either `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. If `template[i]` is not lowercase, `match_a_b` is False. If `template[i].islower()` and both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are equal to `template[i]`, `match_a_b` remains unchanged. `match_c` is True, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input strings with leading/trailing whitespace removed, `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) up to the nth character, and `i` is 2. If `match_a_b` is False, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `template[i]` is not lowercase and `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no additional changes occur.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
