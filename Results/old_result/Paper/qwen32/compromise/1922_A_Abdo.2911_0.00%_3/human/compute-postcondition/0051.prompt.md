Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a specific integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, and `template` is a list containing `n` characters. Each character in `template` is either the corresponding character from `a` if it matches the character in `b` at the same position, or the uppercase version of the character from `a` if it does not match. `match_a_b` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
            match_a_b = False
            break
    elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
        ].lower():
        match_a_b = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a specific integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, and `template` is a list containing `n` characters. Each character in `template` is either the corresponding character from `a` if it matches the character in `b` at the same position, or the uppercase version of the character from `a` if it does not match. If `template[i]` is lowercase, `match_a_b` is set to False if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. If `template[i]` is uppercase, `match_a_b` is set to False if either `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches `template[i]` (ignoring case). Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a specific integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `template` is a list containing `n` characters, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `template[i]` is lowercase, then if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, `match_a_b` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains unchanged. If `template[i]` is not lowercase, then if `a[i].lower()` matches `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` matches `template[i].lower()`, `match_a_b` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to `match_a_b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a specific integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `template` is a list containing `n` characters, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `template[i]` is lowercase: if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, `match_a_b` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains unchanged. If `template[i]` is not lowercase: if `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, then `match_a_b` is set to False. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
