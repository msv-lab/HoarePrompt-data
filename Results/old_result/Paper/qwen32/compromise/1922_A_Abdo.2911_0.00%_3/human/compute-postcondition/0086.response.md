The given initial state includes the conditions `match_a_b is True`, `match_c is True`, and it is not the case that `match_a_b is True and match_c is False`. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is simply `print('NO')`. This means that the output will be the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `match_a_b` and `match_c`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The value of `match_a_b` is `True`.
2. The value of `match_c` is `True`.
3. The condition that `match_a_b is True and match_c is False` is not true because both `match_a_b` and `match_c` are `True`.
4. The `print` statement does not depend on the values of `match_a_b` or `match_c`. It directly prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
