Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `match_a_b` is `True` if none of the conditions to set it to `False` were met during any iteration; otherwise, `match_a_b` is `False`; `match_c` is `True`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if c[i] != template[i]:
            match_c = False
            break
    elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
        match_c = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `match_a_b` is `False` if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` when `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, otherwise `match_a_b` retains its original value. `match_c` is `False` if the lowercase version of the character at index `i` of `c` is equal to the lowercase version of the character at index `i` of `template` when `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, otherwise `match_c` retains its original value. `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `match_a_b` is `False` if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` when `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, otherwise `match_a_b` retains its original value. `match_c` is `False` if `c[i]` is equal to `template[i]` when `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, or if `c[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` when `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, otherwise `match_c` retains its original value. `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` when `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, or if `c[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` when `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `match_a_b` is `False` if `c[2]` is not equal to `template[2]` when `template[2]` is a lowercase letter, otherwise `match_a_b` retains its original value. `match_c` is `False` if `c[2]` is equal to `template[2]` when `template[2]` is not a lowercase letter, or if `c[2].lower()` is equal to `template[2].lower()` when `template[2]` is not a lowercase letter, otherwise `match_c` retains its original value. `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 0. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
