Output State: **`t` is a specific integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, and `template` has an additional element which is the uppercase version of `a[i]`.**

In simple terms, the value of `template` has been updated to include an additional element, which is the uppercase version of the character `a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
