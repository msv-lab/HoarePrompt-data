The code appends the character `a[i]` to the `template` string. Given the initial state, `i` is 4 and `a` is a string provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace. Therefore, `template` will now include the character at index 4 of string `a`.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, and `template` has an additional character which is `a[4]`.**
