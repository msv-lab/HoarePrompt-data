Postcondition: **`match_a_b` is False if `a[i].lower() == template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower() == template[i].lower()` is true, otherwise `match_a_b` remains True. `match_c` is True, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input strings with leading/trailing whitespace removed, `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) up to the nth character, and `i` is 0. `template[i]` is not a lowercase character.**
