To determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop based on the provided initial and intermediate states. Here is the loop code again for reference:

```python
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    c = input().strip()
    template = []
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            template.append(a[i])
        else:
            template.append(a[i].upper())
    match_a_b = True
    for i in range(n):
        if template[i].islower():
            if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                match_a_b = False
                break
        elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
            match_a_b = False
            break
    match_c = True
    for i in range(n):
        if template[i].islower():
            if c[i] != template[i]:
                match_c = False
                break
        elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
            match_c = False
            break
    if match_a_b and not match_c:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

### Analysis of the Loop

1. **Loop Iterations**:
   - The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
   - For each iteration, the loop reads `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input.
   - It constructs a `template` list based on the characters from `a` and `b`.
   - It checks if `a` and `b` match the `template` (`match_a_b`).
   - It checks if `c` matches the `template` (`match_c`).
   - It prints 'YES' if `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

2. **Output States**:
   - **After 1 iteration**: `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is True, leading to 'NO'.
   - **After 2 iterations**: `match_a_b` can be True and `match_c` can be False, or `match_a_b` can be False or `match_c` can be True, leading to either 'YES' or 'NO'.
   - **After 3 iterations**: `template` and `match_a_b` remain the same, and `match_c` is `False` if `match_a_b` is `True` and `match_c` was initially `True`. Otherwise, `match_c` is `True`.

### Final Output State

Since the loop runs `t` times and the state of `template`, `match_a_b`, and `match_c` can vary with each iteration, the final output state depends on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` for each iteration. However, we can determine the overall behavior:

- The loop will print 'YES' for some iterations and 'NO' for others based on the conditions.
- The final output state after all iterations will be a series of 'YES' and 'NO' printed to the console.

Given the information provided, the final output state is a series of 'YES' and 'NO' corresponding to each iteration of the loop. Since we don't have specific values for `a`, `b`, and `c` for all `t` iterations, we can't provide a specific sequence of 'YES' and 'NO'. However, we can describe the final output state in terms of the conditions that lead to 'YES' and 'NO'.

### Final Output State in the Required Format

Output State: **A series of 'YES' and 'NO' printed to the console, determined by the conditions `match_a_b` and `match_c` for each iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the final output state is a sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' printed for each iteration of the loop, where 'YES' is printed if `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False, and 'NO' is printed otherwise.
