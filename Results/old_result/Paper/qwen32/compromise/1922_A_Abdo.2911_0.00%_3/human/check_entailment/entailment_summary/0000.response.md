### Reasoning:
The program's logic follows the problem description closely. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Template Creation**:
   - For each position `i` in the strings `a` and `b`, the program checks if the characters `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same.
   - If they are the same, it appends `a[i]` (in lowercase) to the template.
   - If they are different, it appends `a[i]` (in uppercase) to the template.

2. **Matching Check for `a` and `b`**:
   - The program then verifies if both `a` and `b` match the template as per the rules:
     - If the character in the template is lowercase, the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` must be the same and equal to the template character.
     - If the character in the template is uppercase, the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` must be different from the lowercase version of the template character.

3. **Matching Check for `c`**:
   - The program checks if `c` does not match the template:
     - If the character in the template is lowercase, the corresponding character in `c` must be the same as the template character.
     - If the character in the template is uppercase, the corresponding character in `c` must be different from the lowercase version of the template character.
   - If `c` matches the template, it means `c` should not be considered as a non-matching string, so the program ensures `c` does not match the template in the same way `a` and `b` do.

4. **Output**:
   - If both `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not, the program prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It accurately constructs the template and checks the matching conditions for `a`, `b`, and `c`. The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected for the given examples.
