Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` (1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9). `M` is a list containing the integer `w` if `w` is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. Otherwise, `M` remains an empty list. The operation `w = math.sqrt(q)` results in a TypeError.**
