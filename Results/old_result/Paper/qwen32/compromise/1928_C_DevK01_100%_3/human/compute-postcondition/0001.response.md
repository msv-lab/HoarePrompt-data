The given code attempts to calculate the square root of `q`, which is a list of tuples. However, the `math.sqrt` function expects a single numeric value, not a list of tuples. This will result in a TypeError. Since the operation `w = math.sqrt(q)` cannot be performed as intended, the variable `w` will not be assigned a value, and the code will halt with an error. 

Given the task requirements, we should assume the operation does not proceed and the state remains unchanged except for the error condition.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` (1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9) representing Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling, respectively; `M` is an empty list; the operation `w = math.sqrt(q)` results in a TypeError.**
