You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) indicating the number of sticks available, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: The output state consists of the integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) indicating the number of sticks available, and the list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks remain unchanged. The variable `ans` is still 0. The variable `cnt` is now a dictionary where each key is a unique length from the list `a`, and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that length appears in the list.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: t, n, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, ans, cnt
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the value determined by the program's logic prior to the print statement)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` indicating the number of sticks available, followed by a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks. The function returns a value for each test case indicating whether it is possible to form a triangle with any three of the given sticks.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
