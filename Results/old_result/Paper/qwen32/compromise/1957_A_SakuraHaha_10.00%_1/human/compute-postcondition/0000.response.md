The code snippet provided only reads an integer value from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This integer represents the number of sticks available in a test case. The initial state mentions that there are multiple test cases, each with its own set of sticks and their lengths. However, the provided code only handles reading the number of sticks for a single test case.

Since the code only reads the number of sticks (`n`) and does not affect any other variables or perform any operations on the existing variables, the output state will only reflect the change in the variable `n`.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) indicating the number of sticks available, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. `n` is an input integer representing the number of sticks for the current test case.**
