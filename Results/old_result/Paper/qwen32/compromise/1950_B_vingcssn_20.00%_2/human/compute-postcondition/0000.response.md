The code snippet reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `casos`. This means that `casos` will hold the value of the number of test cases, which was previously described as `t` in the initial state. The values of `t` and `casos` will be the same, and `n` for each test case remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 20, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20; `casos` is equal to `t`.**
