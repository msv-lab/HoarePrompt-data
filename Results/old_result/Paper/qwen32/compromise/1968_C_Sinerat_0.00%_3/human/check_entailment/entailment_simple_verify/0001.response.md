### Reasoning:
Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided solution to ensure the program's correctness based on the annotations and the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Array Constraints**: \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) for all \(1 \le i \le n\).
2. **Modulo Condition**: \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \le i \le n\).

#### Provided Solution:
The solution initializes the first element of the array \(a\) to 500 and then iteratively computes the subsequent elements using the formula \(a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]\).

#### Annotations and Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - \(a[0] = 500\), which is within the valid range.
   
2. **Iteration**:
   - For \(i \ge 1\), \(a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]\).
   - Given \(1 \le x[i-1] \le 500\) and \(a[i-1] \ge 500\), the value of \(a[i]\) will be at least 1000 and at most \(10^9 + 500\), which is still within the valid range as \(10^9 + 500 \le 10^9 + 500 < 10^{10}\).

3. **Modulo Condition**:
   - We need to verify if \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\).
   - Given \(a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]\), the modulo operation \(a[i] \bmod a[i-1]\) simplifies to \(x[i-1]\) because \(a[i-1]\) divides into \(a[i]\) exactly once with a remainder of \(x[i-1]\).

#### Verification:
- **Initial Condition**: \(a[0] = 500\) is valid.
- **Recursive Condition**: \(a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]\) ensures that all elements are within the valid range.
- **Modulo Condition**: \(a[i] \bmod a[i-1] = x[i-1]\) holds true by construction.

Based on the annotations and the step-by-step analysis, the provided solution correctly constructs the array \(a\) such that all conditions are satisfied.

### Final: **True**
