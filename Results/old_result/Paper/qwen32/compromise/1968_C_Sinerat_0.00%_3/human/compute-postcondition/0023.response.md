The given code modifies the list `a` at index `i` by setting it to the value of `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, so `a[3]` is set to `a[2] + x[2]`.

Let's break it down:
- Initially, `a` is defined such that `a[0] = 500`, `a[1] = 500 + x[0]`, and `a[2] = 500 + x[0] + x[1]`.
- The code modifies `a[3]` to be `a[2] + x[2]`.

Therefore, the new value of `a[3]` is `500 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than 3; `x` is a new list of integers; `a` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element set to 500, the second element set to `500 + x[0]`, the third element set to `500 + x[0] + x[1]`, and the fourth element set to `500 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2]`; `i` is 3**.
