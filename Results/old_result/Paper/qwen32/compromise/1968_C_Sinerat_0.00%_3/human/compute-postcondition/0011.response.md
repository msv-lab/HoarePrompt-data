Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each split element to an integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500, the second element is `500 + x[0]`, the third element is `500 + x[0] + x[1]`, ..., and the i-th element (for i > 0) is the sum of the (i-1)-th element of `a` and the (i-1)-th element of `x`.**

### Explanation in Natural Language:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` contains `n` elements. The first element of `a` is 500. Each subsequent element in `a` is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x`. Specifically, the i-th element of `a` (for i > 0) is the sum of the (i-1)-th element of `a` and the (i-1)-th element of `x`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still satisfies the condition 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The variable `n` is an integer greater than 1, and `x` is a list of integers derived from the input.
