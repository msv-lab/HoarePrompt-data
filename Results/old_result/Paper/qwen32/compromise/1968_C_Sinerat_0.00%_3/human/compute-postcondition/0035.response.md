To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Here's the given information:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `x` is a list of integers provided by the input.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[i]` is now `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

In the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented again. The value of `i` at the start of the next iteration will be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

Since the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given that `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `i` to be `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `t` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `x` remains the same.
- `a` remains the same.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers provided by the input, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[i]` is now `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

However, to clearly indicate the next value of `i`, we should express it as `i` being incremented from its previous value. Assuming the previous value of `i` was `i`, the next value will be `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers provided by the input, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[i]` is now `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers provided by the input, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[i]` is now `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since we are only adjusting the state of `i` in the loop head:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`**.

But to provide a more complete state:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers provided by the input, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[i]` is now `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers provided by the input, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[i]` is now `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Given the loop head only involves `i` and `n`, and `n` remains unchanged:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1**.
