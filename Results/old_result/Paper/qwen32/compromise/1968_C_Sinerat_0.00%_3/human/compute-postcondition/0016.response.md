The code snippet `a = [0] * n` changes the list `a` to a new list of `n` zeros. The values of `t`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged. The list `a` loses its previous values and becomes a list of zeros.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value of the input; `x` is a new list of integers obtained by splitting the new input and converting each split element to an integer; `a` is a list of `n` zeros.**
