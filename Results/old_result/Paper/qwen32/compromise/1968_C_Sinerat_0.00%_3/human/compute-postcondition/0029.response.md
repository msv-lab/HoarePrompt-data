The code snippet `a = [0] * n` creates a list `a` with `n` elements, all initialized to 0. This overwrites the previous definition of `a` as a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500 and each subsequent element is the sum of 500 and all elements in `x` up to the previous index. The values of `t` and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value of the input; `x` is a list of integers provided by the input; `a` is a list of `n` integers, all initialized to 0.**
