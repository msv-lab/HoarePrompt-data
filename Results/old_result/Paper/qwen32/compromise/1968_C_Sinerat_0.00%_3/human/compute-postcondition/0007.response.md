The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 (since the loop starts from 1 and the previous iteration would have been with `i` equal to 1), and `n` is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, `i` should be 2. The value of `n` remains the same as it is the upper bound of the loop and does not change within the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each split element to an integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500 and the i-th element (for i > 0) is the sum of the (i-1)-th element of `a` and the (i-1)-th element of `x`; `i` is 2**
