Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each split element to an integer; `a` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element set to 500.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each split element to an integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500 and the i-th element (for i > 0) is the sum of the (i-1)-th element of `a` and the (i-1)-th element of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each split element to an integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500, the second element is `500 + x[0]`, and the third element is `500 + x[0] + x[1]`; `i` is 2

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than 3; `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each split element to an integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500, the second element is `500 + x[0]`, the third element is `500 + x[0] + x[1]`, and the fourth element is `500 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2]`; `i` is 3




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
