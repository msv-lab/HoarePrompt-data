The code assigns the value `500` to the first element of the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each split element to an integer; `a` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element set to 500.**
