The code snippet provided updates the variable `x` by reading a new list of integers from the input. The initial state of `x` is a list of integers derived from a previous input, but this new input overwrites the previous list. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value of the input; `x` is a new list of integers obtained by splitting the new input and converting each split element to an integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500, the second element is `500 + x[0]`, the third element is `500 + x[0] + x[1]`, ..., and the i-th element (for i > 0) is the sum of the (i-1)-th element of `a` and the (i-1)-th element of `x`.**
