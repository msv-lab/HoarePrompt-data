The code `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` updates the value of `a[i]` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. The preconditions `i` is `i + 1` and `n` must be greater than 1 are still valid. The only change is the value of `a[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[i]` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`**.
