Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the number of elements in the array a. The second line contains n-1 integers x_2, x_3, ..., x_n (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500) representing the elements of the array x. The sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [0] * n
    a[0] = 500
    for i in range(1, n):
        a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
    print(*a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each split element to an integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500, the second element is `500 + x[0]`, the third element is `500 + x[0] + x[1]`, ..., and the i-th element (for i > 0) is the sum of the (i-1)-th element of `a` and the (i-1)-th element of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value of the input; `x` is a new list of integers; `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500 and each subsequent element at index `i` (for 1 ≤ i < n) is the sum of 500 and all elements in `x` up to index `i-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of the input, `x` is a list of integers provided by the input, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is 500 and `a[i]` is 500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[i-1] for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
