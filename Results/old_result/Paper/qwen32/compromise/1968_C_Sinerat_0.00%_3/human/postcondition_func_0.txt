The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n-1` integers. For each test case, it constructs and prints an array `a` of length `n` where the first element is 500 and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in the input list `x`.
