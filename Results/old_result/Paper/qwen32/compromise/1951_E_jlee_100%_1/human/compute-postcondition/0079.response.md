Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 0; `string` is the input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0; `x` is `s[0]`. If `count` is greater than 0, `done` is set to True if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is less than `count` or if `count2` equals `count` and `count` is greater than 1 or if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count` is 0, `done` and `count2` remain unchanged.**
