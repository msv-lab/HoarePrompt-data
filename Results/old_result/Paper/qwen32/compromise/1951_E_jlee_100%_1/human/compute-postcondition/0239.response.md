Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

The initial state describes a series of variables and conditions, but the provided code snippet only contains a single line:
```python
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of any variables mentioned in the initial state. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided within the `print` function.

Therefore, based on the given code snippet, the output will be:
Output: **YES**
