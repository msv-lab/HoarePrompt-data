Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `string` is the input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `x` is the first element of `s`, i.e., `s[0]`.
- `j` is incremented by 1, i.e., `j = j + 1`.

The print statement given is:
```python
print(1)
```

From the initial state provided, we can see that the print statement simply outputs the integer `1`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`) do not affect the output of this specific print statement because it does not reference any of them.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1**
