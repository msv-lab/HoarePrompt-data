Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each of the following `t` lines, it accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6). The function processes these strings and returns a result for each string, but the specific result is not detailed in the given constraints and relationships.**
