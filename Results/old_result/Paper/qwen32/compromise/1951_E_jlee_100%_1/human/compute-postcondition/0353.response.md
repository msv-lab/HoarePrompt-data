Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 2; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is greater than 0; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is 0; the current character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to `x`. If `count` is greater than 1, then `count2` is equal to `count` and `done` is True; otherwise, `count` is equal to 1 and `count2` is 0. `done` remains False if `count` is not greater than 1.**
