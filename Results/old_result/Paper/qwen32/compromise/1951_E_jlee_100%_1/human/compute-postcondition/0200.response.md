Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 1; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string and must have at least 1 character; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is `s[0]`. The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is True, otherwise `done` remains False. `count` is greater than 1, and `count2` is equal to `count`. The current value of `count` is greater than 1.**
