Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

The initial state provides a lot of information about the variables and conditions, but the key point to focus on for the `print` statement is the value that is being printed. The `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print(2)
```

This statement directly prints the integer `2`. There are no variables or conditions in the `print` statement itself that depend on the state of the program or any other variables. Therefore, the output will simply be the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
