Given the initial state, we have several variables and conditions described, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of these variables directly. The statement is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `count`, `count2`, or `done`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **YES**
