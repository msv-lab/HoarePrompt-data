The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes various variables and conditions, but the `print` statement itself is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state except for the fact that the code reaches this point and the condition `not done` is true, which allows the code to execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state sets up several variables (`t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `count`, `count2`, `done`), but the `print` statement does not use any of these directly.
2. The `print` statement is a simple `print('YES')`, which means it will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables mentioned in the initial state.
3. The condition `not done` is true, which means the code execution has reached the `print` statement and it will execute.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
