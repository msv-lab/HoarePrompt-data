Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 2; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is greater than 4; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is 4; and `count2` is greater than or equal to 0. If `count` is greater than 0, the behavior depends on the comparison between `s[j]` and `x`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `done` is set to True and the loop breaks. If `s[j]` equals `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is set to True and the loop breaks. If `count2` equals `count` and `count` is greater than 1, `done` is set to True and the loop breaks. If `count2` equals `count` and `count` is not greater than 1, `count2` is reset to 0. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True and the loop breaks. Additionally, if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` at any point, `done` is set to True and the loop breaks. If `count` is not greater than 0, the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, and `count` remain unchanged.**
