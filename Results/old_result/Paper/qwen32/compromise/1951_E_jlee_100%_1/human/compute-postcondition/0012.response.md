The given initial state provides information about the variables and their relationships but does not affect the output of the `print('YES')` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, or `done`. It simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` represents the number of test cases.
2. The variable `i` is initialized to 0.
3. The variable `string` holds the input string.
4. The variable `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
5. The variable `n` is the length of `s`.
6. The variable `x` is the first character of `s`.
7. The condition `x != s[-1]` ensures that the first and last characters of `s` are different.
8. The state of `done` is not specified unless `n` is equal to 1, in which case `done` remains `False`.

However, none of these variables or their values influence the `print('YES')` statement. The `print` statement is straightforward and outputs the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
