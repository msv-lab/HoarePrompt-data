The `continue` statement in the provided code snippet does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since no variables are updated, the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `count`, and `done` remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 0; `string` is the input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is `j + 1`; `count` is `j`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True.**
