The `continue` statement does not affect the values of any variables; it is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement has no impact on the program's state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 0; `string` is the input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is equal to 1; `done` is False.**

In simple terms, none of the variables' values change, and all preconditions remain the same.
