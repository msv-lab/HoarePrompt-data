Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `string` is the newly input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string and must have at least 1 character.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1.
- `x` is the first element of `s`.
- Several conditions and variables (`count`, `count2`, `done`, `j`) are mentioned, but their initial values and the exact logic of how they are modified are not specified in the initial state.
- The provided description includes a series of conditions and actions that would typically be within a loop or if statements, but these are not explicitly defined in the given code snippet.

The code snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables described in the initial state. It simply prints the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **1**
