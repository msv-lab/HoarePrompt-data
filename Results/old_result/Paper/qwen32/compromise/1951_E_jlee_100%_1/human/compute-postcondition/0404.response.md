The `print(1)` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. It simply prints the integer `1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides information about various variables (`t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `count2`), but none of these variables are used in the `print(1)` statement.
2. The `print(1)` statement is hardcoded to output the integer `1`.

Thus, the output of the print statement is simply `1`.

Output: **1**
