### Reasoning:

The program's goal is to determine if a given string can be partitioned into substrings such that none of the substrings is a palindrome. The program reads multiple test cases, each containing a string, and for each string, it decides whether such a partition exists and, if so, provides one possible partition.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Single Character Strings**: If the string has a length of 1, it is inherently a palindrome, so the program correctly prints `NO`.

2. **First and Last Characters Different**: If the first and last characters of the string are different, the entire string is not a palindrome, so the program correctly prints `YES` with the string itself as the partition.

3. **All Characters Same**: If all characters in the string are the same, the string is a palindrome, and no partition can avoid this, so the program correctly prints `NO`.

4. **All but One Character Same**: If all but one character in the string are the same, the program checks if the middle character (if the string length is odd) is different from the others. If it is not, the string can be partitioned into two parts, avoiding a palindrome, and the program prints `YES` with the appropriate partition. If the middle character is the same as the others, the string cannot be partitioned, and the program prints `NO`.

5. **General Case**: For strings that do not fall into the above categories, the program iterates through the string to find a point where the characters are not symmetric around the center. If such a point is found, the string can be partitioned into two parts that are not palindromes, and the program prints `YES` with the appropriate partition. If no such point is found, the program prints `NO`.

The program handles edge cases and general cases correctly based on the provided logic and examples.
