### Reasoning:
The given Python program is designed to decode an encoded string back to its original form based on the encoding rules provided. Let's break down the program to understand its logic and verify its correctness against the problem statement.

#### Program Breakdown:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings (`data`).
   - It then reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string (`n`), and the encoded string (`b`).

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - **Unique Characters Extraction and Sorting:**
     - `unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))`: This line extracts all unique characters from the encoded string `b` and sorts them alphabetically.
   - **Character Mapping:**
     - `char_map = {}`: Initializes an empty dictionary to map each unique character to its symmetric character from the end of `unique_chars`.
     - The loop `for i in range(len_unique):` populates `char_map` such that each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to the corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars` in reverse order.
   - **Decoding Process:**
     - `decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)`: This line constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

3. **Output:**
   - The decoded string for each test case is stored in the `results` list.
   - Finally, the program prints each decoded string.

#### Verification Against Problem Statement:

- **Unique Characters and Symmetric Mapping:** The program correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically. It then creates a mapping where each character is replaced by its symmetric counterpart from the sorted unique characters list.
- **Decoding Process:** The program correctly applies the mapping to decode the encoded string back to its original form.
- **Handling Multiple Test Cases:** The program correctly handles multiple test cases, reading and processing each one independently.

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to the problem statement and correctly decodes the encoded string back to its original form. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
