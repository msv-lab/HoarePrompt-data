To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `len_unique`. The loop iterates over the range of `len_unique`, so we need to ensure that `len_unique` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` is the loop index and will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts, so no specific adjustment is needed for `i` before the loop starts.

Given the provided state, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `len_unique` is greater than 0. This means that `unique_chars` must contain at least one unique lowercase Latin letter.

State: **`encoded` is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5. The total length of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique lowercase Latin letters present in the strings of `encoded` and must have at least 1 element; `char_map` is an empty dictionary; `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars` and must be greater than 0**
