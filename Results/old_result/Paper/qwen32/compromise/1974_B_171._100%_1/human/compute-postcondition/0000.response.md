The code snippet creates a set of unique characters from all the strings in the `encoded` list, sorts these unique characters, and assigns the sorted list to the variable `unique_chars`. The original `encoded` list remains unchanged.

Output State: **`encoded` is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5. The total length of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique lowercase Latin letters present in the strings of `encoded`.**
