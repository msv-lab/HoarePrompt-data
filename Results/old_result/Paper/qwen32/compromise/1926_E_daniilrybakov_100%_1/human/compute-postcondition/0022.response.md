The code snippet `n //= 2` modifies the value of `n` by performing integer division by 2. This means `n` is updated to half of its original value, rounded down to the nearest integer.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer input value such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `k` is an integer read from the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9
- `s` is `2 * x`
- `m` is 4
- `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`

After the execution of `n //= 2`, the value of `n` changes, but the other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `n` is `n // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input value such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is `n // 2` (where `n` is the original value of `n`), `k` is an integer read from the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is `2 * x`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
