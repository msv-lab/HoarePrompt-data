Output State: **`n` is `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is 2, `t` is `t - 1`, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Natural language: The value of `n` has been halved. The values of `k`, `s`, `m`, `t`, and `x` remain unchanged except that `s` and `x` were calculated based on the original value of `n`. Now `n` holds its new halved value.
