The code snippet `s += x` increments the value of `s` by the value of `x`. Given the initial state, the value of `s` is `2 * x`. After the operation, `s` becomes `2 * x + x`, which simplifies to `3 * x`.

The conditions `if s < k and k <= s + x` do not affect the value of `s` directly since they only determine whether to break out of a loop or if statement, which does not change the value of `s` if not broken. Therefore, we only need to update the value of `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input value such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is `n // 2` (where `n` is the original value of `n`), `k` is an integer read from the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is `3 * x`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
