Output State: **`t` is an integer input value such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is now `n // 2`; `k` is the second integer read from the input such that \(1 \leq k \leq \text{original } n\); `s` is `(original n + 1) // 2`; `m` is 2; `x` is `(original n + 1) // 2`; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
