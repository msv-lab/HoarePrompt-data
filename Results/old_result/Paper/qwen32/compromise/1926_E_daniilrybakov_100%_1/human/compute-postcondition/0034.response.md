The value of `x` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer input value such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is the second integer read from the input such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `s` is 0, `m` is 1, and `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.
