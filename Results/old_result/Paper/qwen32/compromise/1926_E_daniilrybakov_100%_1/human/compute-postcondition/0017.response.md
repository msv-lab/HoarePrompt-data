Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input value such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is `n // 2` (where `n` was originally greater than 1), `k` is an integer read from the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is `x`, `m` is 2, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`. If `s < k` and `k <= s + x`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
