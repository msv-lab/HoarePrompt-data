The value of `n` is updated to `n // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer input value such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is the original `n` integer value divided by 2; `k` is the second integer read from the input such that \(1 \leq k \leq \text{original } n\); `s` is `original n + 1`; `m` is 4; `x` is `(original n + 1) // 2`.**
