The code snippet `m *= 2` doubles the value of `m`. Given that `m` was initially 1, after executing the code, `m` becomes 2. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input value such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is a non-zero integer, specifically `n` is the integer division of the original `n` by 2; `k` is the second integer read from the input such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\); `s` is `(n + 1) // 2`; `m` is 2; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
