The code snippet `x = (n + 1) // 2` assigns the value of `(n + 1) // 2` to the variable `x`. Given that `x` was already `(n + 1) // 2` in the initial state, the value of `x` remains unchanged by this operation. The values of other variables `n`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `t` are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `(n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2`, `m` is 4, `t` is `t - 1`, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.
