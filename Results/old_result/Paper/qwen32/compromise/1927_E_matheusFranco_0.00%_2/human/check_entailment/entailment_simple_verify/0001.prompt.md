You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly constructs a k-level permutation for each test case.

### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate a permutation of length `n` such that the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
   - The permutation should consist of distinct integers from 1 to `n`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The code consists of two functions: `func_1()` and `func_2()`.
   - `func_2()` reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1()` for each test case.
   - `func_1()` reads the values of `n` and `k`, initializes a permutation array with zeros, and then fills this array in a specific pattern.

3. **Pattern of Filling the Permutation Array:**
   - The code iterates over `k` and fills the permutation array in a way that each index `i` (where `0 <= i < k`) gets filled with increasing values at positions `i, i+k, i+2k, ...`.
   - Specifically, for each `i` from 0 to `k-1`, it places the next available integer (`curr_v`) at positions `i, i+k, i+2k, ...` until it reaches the end of the array.

4. **Checking the Validity of the Pattern:**
   - The pattern ensures that the numbers are placed in a way that the sums of every segment of length `k` will be as balanced as possible.
   - However, we need to verify if this pattern indeed guarantees that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any segment of length `k` is no more than 1.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - Let's take the example `n=10, k=4`:
     - The code will place numbers in the following manner:
       - `i=0`: Positions 0, 4, 8 get filled with 1, 5, 9 respectively.
       - `i=1`: Positions 1, 5, 9 get filled with 2, 6, 10 respectively.
       - `i=2`: Positions 2, 6 get filled with 3, 7 respectively.
       - `i=3`: Position 3 gets filled with 4.
     - Resulting permutation: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`
     - Sums of segments of length 4: `[10, 14, 18, 22]`
     - Here, the difference between the maximum and minimum sums is 12, which violates the condition.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The pattern used in the code does not guarantee that the sums of all segments of length `k` will differ by no more than 1.
   - Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.
