Let's carefully re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description, code, and function summaries.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to generate a permutation of length `n` such that the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1. The permutation should consist of distinct integers from 1 to `n`.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code consists of two functions:
- `func_1()`: Reads `n` and `k`, initializes a permutation array, and fills it in a specific pattern.
- `func_2()`: Reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### Pattern of Filling the Permutation Array:
The code iterates over `k` and fills the permutation array in a way that each index `i` (where `0 <= i < k`) gets filled with increasing values at positions `i, i+k, i+2k, ...`. Specifically, for each `i` from 0 to `k-1`, it places the next available integer (`curr_v`) at positions `i, i+k, i+2k, ...` until it reaches the end of the array.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the pattern using the example `n=10, k=4`:
- The code will place numbers in the following manner:
  - `i=0`: Positions 0, 4, 8 get filled with 1, 5, 9 respectively.
  - `i=1`: Positions 1, 5, 9 get filled with 2, 6, 10 respectively.
  - `i=2`: Positions 2, 6 get filled with 3, 7 respectively.
  - `i=3`: Position 3 gets filled with 4.
- Resulting permutation: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`
- Sums of segments of length 4:
  - Segment 1: `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`
  - Segment 2: `2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14`
  - Segment 3: `3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18`
  - Segment 4: `4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22`
- Here, the difference between the maximum and minimum sums is 12, which violates the condition.

### Conclusion:
The pattern used in the code does not guarantee that the sums of all segments of length `k` will differ by no more than 1. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly construct a k-level permutation for the given problem description.
