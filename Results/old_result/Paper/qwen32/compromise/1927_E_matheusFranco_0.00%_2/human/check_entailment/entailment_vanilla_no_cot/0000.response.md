To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it constructs a k-level permutation for each test case as described in the problem statement.

Let's break down the logic of the provided code:

1. **Initialization**: The function `func_1` initializes an empty permutation list of length `n` with zeros.
2. **Filling the Permutation**: It then fills this list by placing numbers starting from 1 in a specific pattern. For each index `i` from 0 to `k-1`, it places the next available number at every `k`-th position starting from `i`. This means that the first `k` positions will be filled with the first `k` numbers, the next `k` positions with the next `k` numbers, and so on.
3. **Output**: After filling the permutation, it prints the permutation as a space-separated string.

However, the key point here is whether this method ensures that the permutation is k-level, i.e., the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any `k`-length contiguous subarray is at most 1.

Let's consider an example to see if the generated permutation meets the criteria:

### Example Analysis:
For `n=10` and `k=4`, the function `func_1` generates the following permutation:
```
1 6 3 8 5 10 7 2 9 4
```

Now, let's calculate the sums of all `k`-length (4-length) contiguous subarrays:
- Sum of `[1, 6, 3, 8]` is 18
- Sum of `[6, 3, 8, 5]` is 22
- Sum of `[3, 8, 5, 10]` is 26
- Sum of `[8, 5, 10, 7]` is 30
- Sum of `[5, 10, 7, 2]` is 24
- Sum of `[10, 7, 2, 9]` is 28
- Sum of `[7, 2, 9, 4]` is 22

The differences between the maximum and minimum sums are significant, indicating that the generated permutation is not k-level.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not generate a k-level permutation for all possible values of `n` and `k`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **False**
