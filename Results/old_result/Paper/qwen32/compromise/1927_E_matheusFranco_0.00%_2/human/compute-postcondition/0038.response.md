To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of `permutation`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n`.
- `idx` is 0.
- `idx_v` is 1.
- `curr_v` is `m+m+2`.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1.
- `i` is 1.

The key variable here is `multiples_of_k_plus_i`. The loop will execute if `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than `len(permutation)`. Since `permutation` is a list of length `n`, the condition becomes `multiples_of_k_plus_i < n`.

Right before the loop, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1. For the loop to execute, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `n`. Since `n` is at least 2 (from the given constraints), `multiples_of_k_plus_i` being 1 satisfies this condition.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `multiples_of_k_plus_i` or any other variable in the loop head. The loop can certainly execute one time with the current state.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values `1, 2, 3, ..., m+1` at indices `0, k, 2k, ..., mk` respectively, and `m+2, m+3, ..., m+m+1` at indices `i, i+k, i+2k, ..., i+mk` respectively; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `m+m+2`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1; `i` is 1**
