To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `permutation` list and the related variables.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs while `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`.
- In each iteration, it sets `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` to `curr_v`, then increments `curr_v` by 1 and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k`.

### Initial State Recap:
- `permutation` has specific values at indices `0, k, 2k, ..., mk` and `i, i+k, i+2k, ..., i+mk`.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` starts at 1.
- `curr_v` starts at `m+m+2`.

### Iteration Details:
- After 1 iteration: `permutation[1]` is set to `m+m+2`.
- After 2 iterations: `permutation[1+k]` is set to `m+m+3`.
- After 3 iterations: `permutation[1+2k]` is set to `m+m+4`.

### General Pattern:
- Each iteration sets the value at index `1 + j*k` (where `j` is the iteration count starting from 0) to `curr_v`, and then increments `curr_v` and `multiples_of_k_plus_i`.

### Termination Condition:
- The loop terminates when `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is no longer less than `len(permutation)`.

### Final Output State:
- The loop will continue until `multiples_of_k_plus_i` reaches or exceeds `n`.
- The final value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be `1 + (n-1)/k * k` which simplifies to `n` if `n` is a multiple of `k` or the largest multiple of `k` less than `n` otherwise.
- `curr_v` will have been incremented by the number of iterations, which is `(n-1)//k`.

### Conclusion:
- The `permutation` list will have values `m+m+2, m+m+3, ..., m+m+(n-1)//k` at indices `1, 1+k, 1+2k, ..., 1+(n-1)//k * k`.
- All other variables (`idx`, `idx_v`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values `1, 2, 3, ..., m+1` at indices `0, k, 2k, ..., mk` respectively, and `m+2, m+3, ..., m+m+1` at indices `i, i+k, i+2k, ..., i+mk` respectively except that `permutation[1], permutation[1+k], permutation[1+2k], ..., permutation[1+(n-1)//k * k]` are set to `m+m+2, m+m+3, ..., m+m+(n-1)//k`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `m+m+2 + (n-1)//k`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + (n-1)//k * k`; `i` is 1.**
