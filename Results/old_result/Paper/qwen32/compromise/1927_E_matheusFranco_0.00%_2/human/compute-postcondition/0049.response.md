The code increments the variable `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k`. Given the initial state, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` was initially set to `1 + 2k`. After executing the code, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` becomes `1 + 2k + k`, which simplifies to `1 + 3k`.

Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with `permutation[1 + 2k]` set to `curr_v`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + 3k`; `i` is 1; `n` must be greater than `1 + 2k`; `curr_v` is incremented by 1.**
