To determine the output state, we need to know what `func_1()` does. Since the function definition is not provided, we cannot determine the exact changes to the variables or the return values. However, we can infer that `func_1()` might modify the variable `t` or introduce new variables.

Given the limited information, let's assume `func_1()` could potentially modify `t` or introduce other variables. Without specific details about `func_1()`, we can only state that `t` remains greater than 0 unless explicitly changed by `func_1()`.

If `func_1()` does not modify `t` or any other variables, the output state would simply reflect that `t` is still greater than 0.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0. No other variables are affected.**
