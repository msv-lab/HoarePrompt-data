To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `t > 0` evaluates to `True`. The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust `t`.

Given that `t` is an input integer, we need to ensure that this input integer is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
