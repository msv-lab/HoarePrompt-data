To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will execute if `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of the `permutation` list.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n`.
- `idx` is 0.
- `idx_v` is 1.
- `curr_v` is `m+2`.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i`.
- `i` is the next integer in the range from 0 to k-1.

The key variable here is `multiples_of_k_plus_i`, which is initially set to `i`. Since `i` is the next integer in the range from 0 to k-1, the smallest possible value for `i` (and thus `multiples_of_k_plus_i`) is 0.

Since `permutation` is a list of length `n`, the loop condition `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)` translates to `multiples_of_k_plus_i < n`.

For the loop to execute, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` (which is initially `i`) must be less than `n`. Given that `i` starts from 0, this condition is always satisfied as long as `n` is at least 1, which it is because `n` is at least 2 according to the problem constraints.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute the first time. The state remains as given.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values `1, 2, 3, ..., m+1` at indices `0, k, 2k, ..., mk` respectively, and `0` elsewhere; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `m+2`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i`; `i` is the next integer in the range from 0 to k-1**
