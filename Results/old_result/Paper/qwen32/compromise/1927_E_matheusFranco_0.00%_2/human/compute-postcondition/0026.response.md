To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means that for the loop to execute one more time, the condition `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)` must be true.

Let's analyze the given state and the variables involved in the loop condition:

- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is defined as `i + k`.
- `len(permutation)` is the length of the `permutation` list, which is `n`.

Given the state:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n`.
- `i` is the next integer in the range from 0 to k-1.

Since `i` is the next integer in the range from 0 to k-1, let's consider the possible values of `i`:
- The initial value of `i` is 0.
- After each iteration, `i` increments by 1 until it reaches `k-1`.

Therefore, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will take values `k, 2k, 3k, ..., (k-1)k + k`.

For the loop to continue executing, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `n`:
- `i + k < n`

Since `i` ranges from 0 to `k-1`, the maximum value of `i + k` is `(k-1) + k = 2k - 1`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the following condition must hold:
- `2k - 1 < n`

If this condition is satisfied, the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than `2k - 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted because the loop condition only depends on `multiples_of_k_plus_i` and `len(permutation)`.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values `1, 2, 3, ..., m+1` at indices `0, k, 2k, ..., mk` respectively, except `permutation[i]` is now `m+2`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `m+3`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + k`; `i` is the next integer in the range from 0 to k-1`; `n` must be greater than `2k - 1`**
