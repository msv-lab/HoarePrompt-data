The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `multiples_of_k_plus_i`. Since `i` is described as "the next integer in the range from 0 to k-1", the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will now be equal to `i`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values `1, 2, 3, ..., m+1` at indices `0, k, 2k, ..., mk` respectively, and `0` elsewhere; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `m+2`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i`; `i` is the next integer in the range from 0 to k-1**.
