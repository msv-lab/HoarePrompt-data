The code snippet increments the variable `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k`. Given the initial state, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is initially `i + k`. After executing the code, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` becomes `(i + k) + k`, which simplifies to `i + 2k`.

The values of other variables remain unchanged. Specifically, `n`, `k`, `permutation`, `idx`, `idx_v`, `curr_v`, and `i` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values `1, 2, 3, ..., m+1` at indices `0, k, 2k, ..., mk` respectively, except `permutation[i]` is now `m+2` and `permutation[i + k]` is `m+3`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `m+4`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + 2k`; `i` is the next integer in the range from 0 to k-1`; `n` must be greater than `2k - 1`.**
