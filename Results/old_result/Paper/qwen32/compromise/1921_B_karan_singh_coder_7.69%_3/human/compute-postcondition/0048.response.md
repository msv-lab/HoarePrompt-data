The code snippet `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` increments the variable `cnt` by 1 if the characters at index `i` in strings `s` and `t` are different. If they are the same, `cnt` remains unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is the new string provided by the user input.
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0.
- `s` is the new string provided by the user input.
- `f` is a string of length `n` where each character is either '0' or '1'.
- `s1` is the count of '1's in the string `s`.
- `t1` is the count of '1's in the string `t`.
- `cnt` is 0.
- If `s1` is equal to `t1`, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.

After executing the line `cnt += s[i] != t[i]`, the value of `cnt` will increase by 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`. The values of `s`, `t`, `n`, `f`, `s1`, `t1`, and the condition `s1 == t1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the new string provided by the user input, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `s` is the new string provided by the user input, `f` is a string of length `n` where each character is either '0' or '1', `s1` is the count of '1's in the string `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in the string `t`, `cnt` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`.**
