To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's analyze the provided code and the logic behind it.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` and `m` are read.
   - `ans` is initialized to the value of `n`.
   - `root` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

2. **Loop:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 2` to `i = root`.
   - For each iteration, `cnt` is calculated as `i * i`.
   - `ans` is updated by adding the value of `(n + i) // cnt`.

### Output State:
The loop modifies the value of `ans` by adding a computed value in each iteration. The values of `n`, `m`, and `root` do not change during the loop. The final value of `ans` after the loop is the output state for each test case.

### Output State Format:
The output state should reflect the final value of `ans` after the loop has finished executing for each test case. The format should be as follows:

Output State: **ans for each test case**

### Example:
Given the initial state and the loop, let's consider a simple example to illustrate the output state:

**Input:**
```
1
10 5
```

**Execution:**
- `n = 10`, `m = 5` (though `m` is not used in the loop).
- `ans = 10`
- `root = int(math.sqrt(10)) + 1 = 4`
- Loop iterations:
  - `i = 2`: `cnt = 4`, `ans += (10 + 2) // 4 = 3` → `ans = 13`
  - `i = 3`: `cnt = 9`, `ans += (10 + 3) // 9 = 1` → `ans = 14`
  - `i = 4`: `cnt = 16`, `ans += (10 + 4) // 16 = 0` → `ans = 14`

**Output State:**
Output State: **14**

Since the problem statement asks for a general format and not a specific example, the final output state for each test case can be described as:

Output State: **ans for each test case**

Given the loop's effect on `ans`, we can conclude that the final value of `ans` after the loop is the sum of the initial `n` and the computed values in the loop.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **ans for each test case**
