Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program seems to be trying to solve a different problem, possibly related to counting divisors or a similar number-theoretic problem, rather than counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a brief explanation of why the given program is incorrect for the problem:

1. **Input Parsing**: The function `func_1()` reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\), but the problem specifies that the second integer is \(m\), not \(k\). This is a minor issue but indicates a lack of careful reading of the problem statement.

2. **Logic**: The logic inside `func_1()` is not aligned with the problem requirements. The program calculates something related to divisors and sums, but it does not check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for each pair \((a, b)\).

3. **Loop and Calculation**: The loop and calculations inside `func_1()` do not correspond to the problem's requirements. The program seems to be counting something based on squares and divisors, which is not relevant to the given problem.

To solve the problem correctly, you would need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds. This would involve using the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (gcd) for each pair. Given the constraints, an efficient approach might be necessary to handle up to \(2 \cdot 10^6\) values for \(n\) and \(m\).
