Postcondition: **`t` is greater than the new value of `n` * 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` twice, `ans` is double the minimum of the integer values of the first and second elements of `lst`, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, and `i` is 0. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `lst` is a list with either 1 or 2 elements after removing the element at index 0. If the length of `lst` is 2, `lst` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
