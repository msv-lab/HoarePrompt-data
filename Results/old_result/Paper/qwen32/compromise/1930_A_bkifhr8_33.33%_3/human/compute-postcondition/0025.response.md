The code snippet `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` removes the first element from the list `lst` since `0 * 2` evaluates to `0`. Therefore, the first element of `lst` is removed, and the rest of the list remains unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `ans_f` is an empty list.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `l` is an input string.
- `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces.
- `i` is 5.
- `ans` is the sum of its previous value (assumed 0) and the minimum of the first two integers in `lst`.

After the code execution:
- `lst` will have its first element removed.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans_f` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces with the first element removed, `i` is 5, `ans` is the sum of its previous value (assumed 0) and the minimum of the first two integers in the original `lst`.**
