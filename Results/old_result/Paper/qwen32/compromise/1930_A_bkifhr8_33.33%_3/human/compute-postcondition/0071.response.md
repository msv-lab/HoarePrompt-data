The code provided attempts to remove the element at index `1 * 2` (which is index 2) from the list `lst`. Given the initial state, the following changes occur:

- The first element of `lst` has already been removed, so the new list `lst` has one less element than before.
- The code will remove the element at index 2 from the updated `lst`.

Since `lst` has had its first element removed, the new `lst` will have its indices shifted down by one. Therefore, the element at index 2 of the original `lst` will now be at index 1 in the updated `lst`.

After the removal, the list `lst` will have one less element, and the elements at indices 2 and above will shift down by one.

Given this, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than the new value of `n` * 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` twice, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` after the first element of `lst` is removed, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` has its first and third elements removed, `i` is the previous value of `n` * 2.**

In simpler terms, the list `lst` now has its third element (from the original list) removed, and the rest of the state remains as described.
