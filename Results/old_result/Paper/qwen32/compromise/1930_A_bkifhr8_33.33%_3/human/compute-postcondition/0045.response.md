Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans`, `ans` is the minimum of the integers from `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces, `i` is 0. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, the loop or if statement breaks. Otherwise, `lst` has the first and third elements removed.**
