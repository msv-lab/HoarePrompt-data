Output State: **`t` is greater than the new value of `n` * 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` twice, `ans` is the minimum of the integer values of the first and second elements of `lst`, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces and has exactly 2 elements, `i` is the previous value of `n` * 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables remain unchanged except for the fact that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
