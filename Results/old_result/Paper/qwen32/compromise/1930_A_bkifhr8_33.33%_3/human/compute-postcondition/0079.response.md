The code snippet provided is `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`. This line attempts to remove the element at index `2` from the list `lst`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than the new value of `n` * 2
- `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` twice
- `ans` is the minimum of the integer values of the first and second elements of `lst` plus the minimum of the integer values of the first and second elements of `lst`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `l` is the new input string
- `lst` is either a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces with its first, third, and now second elements removed, or a list with exactly 1 element
- `i` is `n * 2 + 1`

The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` is equivalent to `lst.remove(lst[2])`. This means the element at index `2` of `lst` is removed.

However, the initial state specifies that `lst` can either be a list with its first, third, and now second elements removed, or a list with exactly 1 element. If `lst` has exactly 1 element, it would throw an `IndexError` because there is no element at index `2`. But since the task specifies to simulate the execution without detailing how the program runs, we will assume `lst` has more than 1 element after the removal of the first, third, and second elements.

After removing the element at index `2`, the elements at indices greater than `2` will shift down by one position.

Output State: **`t` is greater than the new value of `n` * 2; `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` twice; `ans` is the minimum of the integer values of the first and second elements of `lst` plus the minimum of the integer values of the first and second elements of `lst`; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is the new input string; `lst` is the list after removing the element at index 2; `i` is `n * 2 + 1`.**

In natural language: The element at index 2 of `lst` has been removed. All other variables remain unchanged except for `lst`, which now has one less element starting from index 2.
