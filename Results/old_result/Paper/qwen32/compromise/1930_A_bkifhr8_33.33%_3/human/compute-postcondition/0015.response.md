Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces. If the length of `lst` is not 2, the first element and the element at index 2 of the original `lst` are removed from `lst`. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, the loop or if statement is broken out of without modifying `lst`.**
