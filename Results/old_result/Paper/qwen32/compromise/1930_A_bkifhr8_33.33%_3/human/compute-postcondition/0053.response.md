The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n * 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans`, `ans` is twice the minimum of the integers from `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces, and `i` is 2.**
