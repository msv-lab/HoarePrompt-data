Postcondition: **`t` is greater than the new value of `n` * 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` twice, `ans` is the minimum of the integer values of the first and second elements of `lst` plus the same minimum value again, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is either the list after removing the element at index 2 if its length was not 2, or a list with exactly 2 elements, and `i` is `n * 2 + 1`. If `lst`'s length was not 2, the loop or if statement breaks.**
