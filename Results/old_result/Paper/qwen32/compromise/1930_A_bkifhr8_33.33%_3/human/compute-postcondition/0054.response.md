The value of `ans` is incremented by the minimum of the integers from `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`. Given that `ans` was initially twice the minimum of these two values, it is now three times the minimum of `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans`, `ans` is three times the minimum of the integers from `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces, and `i` is 2.**
