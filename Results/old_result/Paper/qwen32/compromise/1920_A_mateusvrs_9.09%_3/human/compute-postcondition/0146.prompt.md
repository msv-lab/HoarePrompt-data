Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; each constraint is described by a pair of integers (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9; there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case; all pairs (a, x) are distinct within a test case; `r` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cx = set()
    ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
    bx = -1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, x = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1:
            bx = max(x, bx)
        elif a == 2:
            ax = min(x, ax)
        else:
            cx.add(x)
    if bx >= ax:
        r.append(0)
    else:
        tmp = 0
        for i in cx:
            if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                tmp += 1
        r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `bx` and `ax` are integers. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` has an additional element `0` appended to it. Otherwise, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, and `r` includes the new element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was `1`, `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was `2`, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` values encountered when `a` was `3`, `n` is `0`, and `r` includes the element `1000000009`. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` also includes the element `0`. If `bx` is less than `ax`, `r` also includes the element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` inclusive.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `bx` is the maximum value of `x` when `a` is `1`, `ax` is the minimum value of `x` when `a` is `2`, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` when `a` is neither `1` nor `2`, `n` is the input integer, and `r` includes `1000000009`. If `bx >= ax`, then `r` includes `1000000009` and possibly `0`. Otherwise, `r` includes `1000000009`, `0`, and `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
