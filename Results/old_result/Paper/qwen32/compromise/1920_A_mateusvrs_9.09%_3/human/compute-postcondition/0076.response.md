Let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state:

Initial State:
- `a` is the first integer from the input.
- `x` is the second integer from the input.
- `n` is `n + 1`.
- `r` includes the new element `1000000009`.
- `bx` is `max(x, -1)`.
- `ax` is `1000000007` if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `ax` is `min(x, 1000000007)`.
- `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `x`.

Code Snippet:
```python
ax = min(x, ax)
```

Impact of the Code:
- The value of `ax` is updated to be the minimum of `x` and its current value.

Output State:
- `a` remains the first integer from the input.
- `x` remains the second integer from the input.
- `n` remains `n + 1`.
- `r` remains including the new element `1000000009`.
- `bx` remains `max(x, -1)`.
- `ax` is now `min(x, ax)`. Specifically:
  - If `a` was 1 or 2, `ax` was initially `1000000007`, so `ax` becomes `min(x, 1000000007)`.
  - If `a` was not 1 or 2, `ax` was initially `min(x, 1000000007)`, so `ax` becomes `min(x, min(x, 1000000007))`, which simplifies to `min(x, 1000000007)`.
- `cx` remains an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise it remains a set containing `x`.

Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `n` is `n + 1`, `r` includes the new element `1000000009`, `bx` is `max(x, -1)`, `ax` is `min(x, 1000000007)`, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `x`.**
