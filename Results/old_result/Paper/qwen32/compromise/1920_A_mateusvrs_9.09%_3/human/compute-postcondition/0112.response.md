Postcondition: **`bx` is `-1`, `ax` is `min(x, 1000000007)` if `a` is `2`, otherwise `ax` remains `1000000007`. `cx` is an empty set if `a` is `2`, otherwise `cx` contains `{x}`. `n` is greater than `0`, `r` includes the element `1000000009`, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, and `a` is not equal to `1`.**
