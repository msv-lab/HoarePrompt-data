Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of several constraints defined by pairs (a, x). It calculates and outputs an integer for each test case based on the constraints, specifically focusing on the relationship between the maximum value of type 1 constraints (`bx`) and the minimum value of type 2 constraints (`ax`). If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, it outputs 0. Otherwise, it counts how many type 3 constraints fall within the range [bx, ax] and outputs the difference between the range size and this count.**
