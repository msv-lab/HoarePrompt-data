Postcondition: **`a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `n` is now `n - 1`, `r` includes the new element `1000000009`, `bx` is `max(x, -1)` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `ax` is `min(x, 1000000007)` if `a` is 1, `ax` is `min(x, 1000000007)` if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` remains `1000000007`, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `x`.**
