The code snippet `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Given the initial state, `cx` is initially an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, and contains `{x}` if `a` is neither 1 nor 2. After executing `cx.add(x)`, `cx` will definitely contain `x`.

Therefore, the updated state of `cx` is that it contains `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `cx` contains `{x}`, `n` is greater than 1, `r` includes the element 1000000009.**
