Postcondition: **`bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was `1`, `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was `2`, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` values encountered when `a` was `3` and contains at least one element, `n` is `0`, `r` includes the new element `1000000009`, `bx` is less than `ax`. If `i` is a value such that `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and `i` is less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is `1`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains `0`.**
