The given Python code snippet initializes an empty set named `cx`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `r`, which remain unchanged. The only change is that `cx` is now an empty set.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; each constraint is described by a pair of integers (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9; there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case; all pairs (a, x) are distinct within a test case; `r` is an empty list; `cx` is an empty set.**
