The code snippet `cx.add(x)` adds the integer `x` to the set `cx`. Given the initial state, `cx` is either an empty set (if `a` is 1 or 3) or a set containing the integer `x` (if `a` is not 1 or 3). After executing the code, `cx` will definitely contain the integer `x`.

Here's the updated output state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `n` remains an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `r` remains an empty list.
- `cx` now contains the integer `x` (regardless of its initial state).
- `ax` remains 1000000007 if `a` is 1 or 3, otherwise `ax` remains the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`.
- `bx` remains `x` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` remains -1.
- `a` and `x` remain the integers read from the input where `a` ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `r` is an empty list; `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`; `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is 1 or 3, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`; `bx` is `x` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1; `a` and `x` are the integers read from the input where `a` ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.**
