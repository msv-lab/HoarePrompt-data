`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The constraints on `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) remain valid. The other variables (`n`, constraints of type 1 and type 2) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. Each constraint is described by a pair of integers (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case. All pairs (a, x) are distinct within a test case.**
