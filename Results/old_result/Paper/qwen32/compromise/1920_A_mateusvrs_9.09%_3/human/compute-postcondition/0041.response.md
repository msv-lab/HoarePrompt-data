The only object in the loop head is the variable `i` and the iterable `cx`. Since `cx` is given to be an iterable with at least one element, it does not need adjustment. The variable `i` needs to be adjusted to reflect the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the last element processed from `cx`. For the loop to execute one more time, `cx` must still have elements left to process, but since we are only adjusting the loop head variables, we focus on `i`.

Given that `cx` has at least one element, we can assume that `i` will take on the next value from `cx` in the next iteration. Therefore, we do not have specific information about what the next value of `i` will be, except that it will be the next element in `cx`.

State: **`bx` is less than `ax`, `cx` is an iterable with at least one element, `i` is the next element from `cx`**
