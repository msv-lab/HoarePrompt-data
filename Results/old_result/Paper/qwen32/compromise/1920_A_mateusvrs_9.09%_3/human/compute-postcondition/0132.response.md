The given code snippet initializes a variable `tmp` to `0`. None of the other variables (`bx`, `ax`, `cx`, `n`, `r`) are modified by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same except for the addition of the `tmp` variable.

Output State: **`bx` is the maximum value of `x` when `a` is `1`, `ax` is the minimum value of `x` when `a` is `2`, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` when `a` is neither `1` nor `2`, `n` is the input integer, and `r` includes `1000000009` and possibly `0`. Additionally, `bx` is less than `ax`; `tmp` is `0`.**
