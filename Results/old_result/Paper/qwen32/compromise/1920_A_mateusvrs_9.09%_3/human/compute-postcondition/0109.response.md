The code snippet `ax = min(x, ax)` updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `x`. Given that `ax` is initially `1000000007` and `x` is the second integer from the input, the new value of `ax` will be the smaller of these two numbers.

Since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we can only express the output state in terms of `x`.

If `x` is less than or equal to `1000000007`, then `ax` will be updated to `x`. Otherwise, `ax` will remain `1000000007`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is equal to `2`, `bx` is `-1`, `ax` is `min(x, 1000000007)`, `cx` is an empty set, `n` is greater than `0`, `r` includes the element `1000000009`, and `x` is the second integer from the input.**
