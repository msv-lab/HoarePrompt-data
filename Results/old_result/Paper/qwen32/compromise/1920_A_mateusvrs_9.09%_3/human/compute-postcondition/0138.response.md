The code snippet provided increments the value of `tmp` by 1. No other variables are modified in the given code. Therefore, the value of `tmp` will increase by 1 from its current value.

Given the initial state, `tmp` could be either `0` or `1` depending on whether `i` was within the range `[bx, ax]` or not. After executing `tmp += 1`, if `tmp` was initially `0`, it will become `1`, and if `tmp` was initially `1`, it will become `2`.

Output State: **`bx` is the maximum value of `x` when `a` is `1`, `ax` is the minimum value of `x` when `a` is `2`, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` when `a` is neither `1` nor `2` and must contain at least one element, `n` is the input integer, and `r` includes `1000000009` and possibly `0`. Additionally, `bx` is less than `ax`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is `1`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains `0`. `i` is the next element in `cx` after the current `i`. `tmp` is incremented by 1.**
