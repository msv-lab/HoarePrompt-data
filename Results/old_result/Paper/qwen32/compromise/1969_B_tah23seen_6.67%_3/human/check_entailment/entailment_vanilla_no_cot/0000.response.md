Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the allowed operations. The approach taken in `func_1` is flawed because it attempts to swap '0's and '1's directly without considering the cost of cyclic shifts properly. It also does not handle multiple '0's and '1's correctly, and it may not find the optimal sequence of operations.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the positions of the '1's in the string and calculate the cost of moving them to the end of the string, which would result in a sorted string. A more appropriate approach involves calculating the cost based on the indices of '1's and their relative positions. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def min_cost_to_sort(s):
    n = len(s)
    ones_indices = [i for i in range(n) if s[i] == '1']
    cost = 0
    for i, index in enumerate(ones_indices):
        cost += index - i
    return cost

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    s = input().strip()
    print(min_cost_to_sort(s))
```

This corrected program calculates the minimum cost by determining the cost of moving each '1' to its correct position in the sorted string, which is after all the '0's. This is done by summing up the difference between the current index of each '1' and its target index in the sorted string.
