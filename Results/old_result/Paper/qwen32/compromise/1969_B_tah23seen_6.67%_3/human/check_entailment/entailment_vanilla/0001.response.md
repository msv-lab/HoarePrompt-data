Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's should come before all '1's) using cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring `s[l...r]` is `r - l + 1`.

### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. **String Conversion**: For each test case, it converts the input string `sChar` into a list `s`.
3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - It initializes `left` pointer at 0 and `right` pointer at 1.
   - It uses a while loop to iterate through the string.
   - If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', it swaps these two elements and adds the cost `(right - left + 1)` to the total cost.
   - It then moves the `right` pointer to the next '0' and the `left` pointer to the next '1'.
4. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `left <= right` and both pointers are within the string bounds.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Loop Condition**: The condition `left <= right` is not appropriate because it allows `left` to be equal to `right`, which can lead to unnecessary iterations and incorrect results.
2. **Swapping Elements**: Swapping elements directly in the list does not correctly simulate a cyclic shift on a substring. A cyclic shift involves moving a segment of the string around, not just swapping two elements.
3. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation assumes that swapping two elements is equivalent to a cyclic shift, which is incorrect.
4. **Logic for Finding Minimum Cost**: The logic for finding the minimum cost is flawed. The program does not correctly account for the cost of performing cyclic shifts on substrings to achieve the desired sorted order.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It incorrectly simulates cyclic shifts and calculates the cost, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
