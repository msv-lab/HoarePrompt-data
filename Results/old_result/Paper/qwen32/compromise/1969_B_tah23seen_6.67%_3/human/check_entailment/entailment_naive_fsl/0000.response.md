Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the allowed cyclic shifts. Let's analyze why this is the case.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Swapping Elements**: The code attempts to swap elements directly when it finds a '0' to the right of a '1', but this does not account for the actual cost of performing a cyclic shift on the substring that includes these elements. It simply adds `right - left + 1` to the cost without ensuring that the substring is correctly shifted.
   
2. **Lack of Proper Substring Handling**: The code does not handle the cyclic shifting of substrings properly. It only swaps elements and calculates the cost based on their positions, which is not equivalent to performing a cyclic shift on the substring.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The code does not handle certain edge cases correctly. For example, consider the string "11000". The code might incorrectly calculate the cost by swapping elements directly rather than performing the necessary cyclic shifts.

### Counterexample:
Let's take the string "11000" as an example. The optimal way to sort this string would involve multiple cyclic shifts, but the provided code might not perform these shifts correctly.

- **Optimal Steps**:
  1. Choose substring [1, 3]: "11000" -> "01100" (Cost: 3)
  2. Choose substring [2, 4]: "01100" -> "00110" (Cost: 3)
  3. Choose substring [3, 5]: "00110" -> "00011" (Cost: 3)

Total cost: 9

- **Code Behavior**:
  The code might incorrectly swap elements directly, leading to an incorrect cost calculation.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. Therefore, it is incorrect.
