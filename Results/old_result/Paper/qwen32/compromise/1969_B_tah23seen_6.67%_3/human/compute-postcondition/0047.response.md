To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the given information step-by-step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `right` is set to `len(s)`.
   - `left` is set to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the string `s`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `left < len(s)` and `s[left] != '1'`.

3. **Loop Execution Details**:
   - After 1 iteration: `left` becomes 1, meaning `s[0]` was not '1'.
   - After 2 iterations: `left` becomes 2, meaning `s[1]` was also not '1'.
   - After 3 iterations: `left` becomes 3, meaning `s[2]` was also not '1'.

From these details, we can infer that the string `s` must have at least 4 characters, and the first three characters (`s[0]`, `s[1]`, `s[2]`) are not '1'. The loop will continue to increment `left` until it either reaches the end of the string or finds a '1'.

Since the loop has already executed 3 times and `left` is now 3, the next character to check is `s[3]`. There are two possibilities:
- If `s[3]` is '1', the loop will terminate because `s[left] == '1'`.
- If `s[3]` is not '1', the loop will increment `left` to 4, and since `left` would then be equal to `len(s)`, the loop will terminate because `left < len(s)` would no longer be true.

Given the information provided, the loop will stop when `left` points to the first '1' it encounters or when `left` equals `len(s)` if no '1' is found.

Since the problem does not specify the exact content of `s` beyond the first three characters, we assume the simplest scenario where `s[3]` is '1' (the first '1' encountered after the initial three characters).

Therefore, the final output state will be:
- `right` remains `len(s)`.
- `left` will be 3, pointing to the first '1' in `s`.

Output State: **right is len(s), left is 3.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing, `right` will still be the length of the string `s`, and `left` will be at the index of the first '1' in `s`, which is index 3 in this case.
