To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

The loop condition is `left < len(s) and s[left] != '1'`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `right` is `len(s)`
- `left` is 1

For the loop to execute one more time, both parts of the condition must be true:
1. `left < len(s)` must be true.
2. `s[left] != '1'` must be true.

Since `left` is 1 and `right` is `len(s)`, we know that `left` is indeed less than `len(s)`. Therefore, the first part of the condition is satisfied.

However, the second part of the condition requires that the character at index `left` (which is 1) in the string `s` must not be '1'. To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `s[left]` is not '1'.

Thus, the state needs to be modified to ensure that `s[1]` is not '1'.

State: **`right` is `len(s)`, `left` is 1, and `s[1]` is not '1'**
