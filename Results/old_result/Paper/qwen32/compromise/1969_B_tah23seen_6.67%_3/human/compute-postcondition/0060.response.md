The value of `left` is incremented by 1. Initially, `left` is `3`, so after the increment, `left` becomes `4`. The other variables (`right` and `len(s)`) and conditions (`len(s)` must be greater than `3` and `s[3]` must not be '1') remain unchanged.

Output State: **`right` is `len(s)`, `left` is `4`, `len(s)` must be greater than `3`, and `s[3]` must not be '1'**.
