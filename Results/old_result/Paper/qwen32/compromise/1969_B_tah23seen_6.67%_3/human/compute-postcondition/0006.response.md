The code appends the value of `i` (which is `sChar[2]`) to the list `s`. This means that the list `s` now includes the third element of `sChar` at its end.

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, the total length of all strings in `sChar` does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `sChar` must contain at least two strings; `i` is `sChar[2]`; `s` is a list that includes all its original elements plus `sChar[2]` at the end.**
