To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop statement:

```
while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will continue to execute as long as two conditions are met:
1. `right` is less than the length of `s`.
2. The character at index `right` in `s` is not '0'.

Given the current state:
- `sChar` is a list of strings where each string consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `s` is a list that contains all the elements of `sChar` with `s[1]` being '1' and `s[2]` being '1'.
- `left` is 0.
- `right` is 3.
- `len(s)` must be greater than 2.

Let's analyze the conditions:
- For the loop to execute, `right` (which is currently 3) must be less than `len(s)`. Since `len(s)` is greater than 2, this condition is satisfied.
- The second condition is that `s[right]` (which is `s[3]`) must not be '0'. 

Since we need to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `s[3]` is '1'. This is because if `s[3]` were '0', the loop would terminate.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `s[3]` is '1'.

State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `s` is a list that contains all the elements of `sChar` with `s[1]` being '1', `s[2]` being '1', and `s[3]` being '1'; `left` is 0; `right` is 3; `len(s)` must be greater than 2**
