### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summary to verify if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Objective**: Distribute coins on `n` outcomes such that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
- **Formal Condition**: For each outcome `i`, the total bet `sum(x_i)` should be less than `k_i * x_i`.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals`.

2. **Calculating Product**:
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers `prod`.

3. **Computing `vprod`**:
   - It computes `vprod` where each element is `prod // vals[i]`.

4. **Calculating `den`**:
   - It calculates `den` as `prod - sum(vprod)`.

5. **Checking Validity**:
   - If `den <= 0`, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution is possible.
   - Otherwise, it prints the values in `vprod`.

#### Verification:
- **Logic of `vprod`**:
  - Each `vprod[i] = prod // vals[i]` is intended to distribute the bets such that `k_i * x_i` is greater than the total bet.
  - This is because `prod` is the product of all multipliers, and dividing by each `k_i` gives a value that, when multiplied back by `k_i`, equals the product of all other multipliers.

- **Condition `den = prod - sum(vprod)`**:
  - This condition checks if the total bet is less than the minimum amount received back for any winning outcome.
  - If `den <= 0`, it means that the total bet is not strictly less than the minimum amount received back, and hence, no valid distribution is possible.
  - If `den > 0`, the distribution `vprod` is valid because:
    - For each `i`, `k_i * vprod[i] = prod - sum(vprod) + vprod[i] = prod - sum(vprod) + prod // k_i`.
    - Since `prod - sum(vprod) > 0` and `prod // k_i > 0`, `k_i * vprod[i] > sum(vprod)`, which means the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for the `i-th` outcome.

#### Example Analysis:
Let's verify with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - `n = 3`, `vals = [3, 2, 7]`
   - `prod = 3 * 2 * 7 = 42`
   - `vprod = [42 // 3, 42 // 2, 42 // 7] = [14, 21, 6]`
   - `den = 42 - (14 + 21 + 6) = 1`
   - Since `den > 0`, the distribution `[14, 21, 6]` is valid.
   - Total bet = `14 + 21 + 6 = 41`
   - Amounts received back: `3*14 = 42`, `2*21 = 42`, `7*6 = 42` (all greater than 41).

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - `n = 2`, `vals = [3, 3]`
   - `prod = 3 * 3 = 9`
   - `vprod = [9 // 3, 9 // 3] = [3, 3]`
   - `den = 9 - (3 + 3) = 3`
   - Since `den > 0`, the distribution `[3, 3]` is valid.
   - Total bet = `3 + 3 = 6`
   - Amounts received back: `3*3 = 9`, `3*3 = 9` (both greater than 6).

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - `n = 5`, `vals = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`
   - `prod = 5^5 = 3125`
   - `vprod = [3125 // 5] * 5 = [625] * 5`
   - `den = 3125 - (625 * 5) = 0`
   - Since `den <= 0`, no valid distribution is possible.

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - `n = 6`, `vals = [7, 9, 3, 17, 9, 13]`
   - `prod = 7 * 9 * 3 * 17 * 9 * 13 = 381159`
   - `vprod = [54451, 42351, 127053, 22421, 42351, 29319]`
   - `den = 381159 - (54451 + 42351 + 127053 + 22421 + 42351 + 29319) = 1`
   - Since `den > 0`, the distribution is valid.

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - `n = 3`, `vals = [6, 3, 2]`
   - `prod = 6 * 3 * 2 = 36`
   - `vprod = [36 // 6, 36 // 3, 36 // 2] = [6, 12, 18]`
   - `den = 36 - (6 + 12 + 18) = 0`
   - Since `den <= 0`, no valid distribution is possible.

6. **Sixth Test Case**:
   - `n = 5`, `vals = [9, 4, 6, 8, 3]`
   - `prod = 9 * 4 * 6 * 8 * 3 = 5184`
   - `vprod = [576, 1296, 864, 648, 1728]`
   - `den = 5184 - (576 + 1296 + 864 + 648 + 1728) = 0`
   - Since `den <= 0`, no valid distribution is possible.

#### Conclusion:
The logic of the program is correct for the given examples. The approach ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome when `den > 0`. If `den <= 0`, it correctly identifies that no valid distribution is possible.
