### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the given program to verify its correctness.

The task is to reconstruct a permutation \( p \) from the array \( a \) using the relationship:
\[ a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \]

The program's approach is to iterate over the array \( a \) in reverse order and compute \( p \) using the formula:
\[ p_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - a_i \]

Let's break down the logic step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is initialized to \( n \), the length of the permutation. This is because the maximum possible MEX for an empty array is \( n \).

2. **Reverse Iteration**:
   - The program iterates over the array \( a \) from the last element to the first. For each element \( a[i] \), it calculates \( p[i] \) as `mex - a[i]`.

3. **Updating `mex`**:
   - After calculating \( p[i] \), the program updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. This step ensures that `mex` always represents the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in \( p \) (up to the current point in the reverse iteration).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed permutation \( p \) for each test case.

### Analysis:

Let's verify if this approach correctly constructs the permutation \( p \):

- **Reverse Iteration and Calculation**:
  - By iterating in reverse, the program ensures that for each \( p[i] \), the MEX of the previously computed \( p \) values is correctly considered. The formula \( p_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - a_i \) is correctly implemented.

- **Updating `mex`**:
  - The update of `mex` ensures that the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in \( p \) is tracked correctly. This is crucial to maintain the validity of the permutation.

- **Constructing a Valid Permutation**:
  - The approach guarantees that all integers from \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \) are used exactly once in \( p \). This is because the MEX calculation and the reverse iteration ensure that each \( p[i] \) is a unique non-negative integer within the range.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly constructs a valid permutation \( p \) for each test case based on the given array \( a \). The logic and the implementation are sound.

**Final: True**
