Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We are given a permutation `p` of integers from `0` to `n-1`.
- We are also given an array `a` of length `n` where `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
- We need to reconstruct the permutation `p` from the array `a`.

### Key Points:
- `MEX` is the minimum non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of `p`.
- The program iterates from the end of `a` to the beginning to construct `p`.

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        print(*p)
```

### Issues in the Program:
1. **MEX Calculation**: The program initializes `mex` to `n` and then updates it as `mex = min(mex, p[i])` in each iteration. This approach does not correctly calculate the MEX of the current prefix of `p` because it does not account for the presence of elements in `p` as the loop progresses.
2. **Correct MEX Calculation**: The MEX should be recalculated at each step based on the current elements in `p`. This can be efficiently handled using a set to keep track of used elements and finding the smallest missing integer.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3
-2 1 2
```
- The correct permutation `p` should be `[2, 0, 1]` as per the example.
- The provided program will output `[2, 0, 0]` because the `mex` is not recalculated correctly after the first iteration.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly calculate the MEX for each prefix of `p` and thus does not construct the correct permutation `p` for all cases. The MEX should be recalculated at each step based on the current elements in `p`, which the provided program does not do.
