You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The given problem requires us to construct a permutation `p` from an array `a` based on the relationship `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by iterating over the array `a` in reverse order. It maintains a variable `mex` which is initialized to `n` (the length of the permutation). For each element in `a`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]` and then updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization**: `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the highest possible value of `MEX` for an array of length `n` (since `MEX` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array).

2. **Reverse Iteration**: The program iterates over the array `a` in reverse order. For each element `a[i]`, it calculates `p[i]` using the formula `mex - a[i]`. This formula is derived from the given relationship `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`, which can be rearranged to `p_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - a_i`.

3. **Updating `mex`**: After calculating `p[i]`, the program updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. This step ensures that `mex` always represents the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `p` (up to the current point in the reverse iteration).

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the constructed permutation `p` for each test case.

### Analysis:

The approach taken by the program is correct. By iterating in reverse and using the formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]`, the program effectively constructs a valid permutation `p` that satisfies the given relationship with `a`. The update of `mex` ensures that the constructed permutation is valid and contains all integers from `0` to `n-1` exactly once.

### Conclusion:

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided logic.

**Correctness: True**
