`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. After this line of code, `t` will have the value provided by the user input, which still satisfies the condition 1 <= t <= 10^4. The other variables (`n`, `a`, and the elements of `a`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data.**
