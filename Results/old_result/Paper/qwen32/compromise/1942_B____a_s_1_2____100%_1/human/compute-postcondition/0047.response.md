Output State: **t is t-2, n is greater than or equal to 1, a is the new list of integers input by the user, p is a list of length n with each i-th element equal to mex - a[i], mex is the minimum value between n and the smallest value in the list p.**

In simpler terms: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `t` remains `t-2`, `n` stays as the input integer, and `a` retains the list of integers provided by the user. The list `p` is updated such that each element `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`, where `mex` is the smallest possible non-negative integer that is not present in `p` and is initially set to `n`. After all iterations, `mex` is the minimum value between `n` and the smallest value in the list `p`.
