The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by `1`, making it `0`.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:
- `i` should be decremented by `1` to `0`.

The other variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `p`, and `mex` are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list where the 1st element is `mex - a[1]` and all other elements are `-1`, `mex` is `min(min(n, n - a[1]), min(n, n - a[1]) - a[1])`, `i` is 0**
