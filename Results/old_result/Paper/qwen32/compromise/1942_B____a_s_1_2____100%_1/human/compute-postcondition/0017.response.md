The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not plan to use. However, the loop runs `t` times, so the state we need to adjust is `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Since the loop runs `t` times, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list where the `i`-th element is `mex - a[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that has not yet appeared in the list `p`.**

Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted, and it needs to be decremented for the loop to proceed, the state becomes:
State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list where the `i`-th element is `mex - a[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that has not yet appeared in the list `p`.**
