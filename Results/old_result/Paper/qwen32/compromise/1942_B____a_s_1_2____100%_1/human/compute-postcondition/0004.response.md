The code snippet initializes a list `p` with `-1` repeated `n` times. This does not affect the values of `t` and `a`. Therefore, the output state will maintain the initial values of `t` and `a`, while `p` will be a list of `-1` with a length of `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the integer input by the user such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is an integer input by the user; `p` is a list of `-1` with length `n`.**
