The value of `mex` is updated to `n`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is `t-1`; `n` is the length of the new list `a` input by the user; `a` is the new list of integers input by the user; `p` is a list of length `n` with all elements equal to `-1`; `mex` is `n`.
