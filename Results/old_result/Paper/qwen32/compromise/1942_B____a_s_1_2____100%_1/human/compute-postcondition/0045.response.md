Output State: **`t` is `t-2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the new list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` with the `i`-th element equal to `mex - a[i]` (where `i` is `n - 2`), the rest equal to `-1`, `mex` is `min(mex, p[i])`, `i` is `n - 3`**

Explanation: The value of `p[i]` where `i` is `n - 2` is updated to `mex - a[i]`. The value of `mex` is then recalculated as `min(mex, p[i])`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and the rest of `p` remain unchanged. The index `i` is decremented by 1, making it `n - 3`.
