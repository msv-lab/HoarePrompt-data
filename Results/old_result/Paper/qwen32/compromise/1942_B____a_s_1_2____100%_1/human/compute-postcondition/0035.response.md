The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and then maps each string to an integer, updating the list `a` with these integer values. 

Given the initial state, the variable `a` was already defined as a list of integers input by the user. However, the provided code snippet will overwrite the existing list `a` with a new list of integers provided by the user input.

Output State: **`t` is `t-2`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` with the `i`-th element equal to `mex - a[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, and `mex` is the minimum value in the list `p`.** 

In simpler terms, the list `a` has been updated to a new list of integers provided by the user input. All other variables remain unchanged.
