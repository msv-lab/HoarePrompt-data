Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the integer provided as input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `l1` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list containing the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`, `i` is 2. If `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]`, no change is made to the variables. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` and `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `idx1` and `idx2` are set to 2. Otherwise, `idx1` is set to 2 if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, `idx2` is set to 2 if `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `p1` is set to 1 if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, `p2` is set to 1 if `l2[i + p2] == a1`, and if both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
