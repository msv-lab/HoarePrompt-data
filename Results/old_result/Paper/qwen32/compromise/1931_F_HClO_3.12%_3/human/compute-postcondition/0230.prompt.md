Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 1, `n` and `m` are unchanged, `a1` and `l1` are unchanged except `l1` now contains `a1` at the end if `idx1 > idx2`, `a2` and `l2` are unchanged except `l2` now includes `a2` at the end if `idx1 < idx2`, `l11` and `l22` are unchanged, `idx1` and `idx2` are -1, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1 depending on the last iteration, `val` is an empty list if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from the input and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, and `m` is set to 1 if `idx1 <= idx2`. The list `l` is either `l1` with `a1` inserted at `idx2` or `l2` with `a2` inserted at `idx1`, depending on the indices of `a1` and `a2` in `l3` and the condition `idx1 < idx2`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1, `n` and `m` are unchanged except `m` must be at least 3, `a1` and `l1` are unchanged except `l1` now contains `a1` at the end if `idx1 > idx2`, `a2` and `l2` are unchanged except `l2` now includes `a2` at the end if `idx1 < idx2`, `l11` and `l22` are unchanged, `idx1` and `idx2` are -1, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1 depending on the last iteration, `val` is a list containing two tuples `(a3, l3)` and `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `l` is either `l1` with `a1` inserted at `idx2` or `l2` with `a2` inserted at `idx1`, depending on the indices of `a1` and `a2` in `l3` and the condition `idx1 < idx2`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 1, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `m + 1`, `a1` and `l1` are unchanged except `l1` now contains `a1` at the end if `idx1 > idx2`, `a2` and `l2` are unchanged except `l2` now includes `a2` at the end if `idx1 < idx2`, `l11` and `l22` are unchanged, `idx1` and `idx2` are -1, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1 depending on the last iteration, `val` is a list containing three tuples `(a3, l3)` and `(a3, l3)` and `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `l` is either `l1` with `a1` inserted at `idx2` or `l2` with `a2` inserted at `idx1`, depending on the indices of `a1` and `a2` in `l3` and the condition `idx1 < idx2`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 1, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `m + 1`, `a1` and `l1` are unchanged except `l1` now contains `a1` at the end if `idx1 > idx2`, `a2` and `l2` are unchanged except `l2` now includes `a2` at the end if `idx1 < idx2`, `l11` and `l22` are unchanged, `idx1` and `idx2` are -1, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1 depending on the last iteration, `val` is a list containing four tuples `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `l` is either `l1` with `a1` inserted at `idx2` or `l2` with `a2` inserted at `idx1`, depending on the indices of `a1` and `a2` in `l3` and the condition `idx1 < idx2`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
