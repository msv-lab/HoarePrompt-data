The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the range `n - 1`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n - 1` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute at least once. This means `n` must be at least 2.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the integer provided as input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `l1` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list containing the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0**
