Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains adjusted to allow for one more iteration; `n` is at least 4; `m` remains at least 5 unless `m` was equal to 2, in which case `m` remains 1 and the loop continues to the next iteration; `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l11`, and `l22` remain unchanged from their initial values; `i` is `n - 2`; `idx1` and `idx2` remain -1 if no early break condition was met; `p1` and `p2` remain 0 if no occurrences of `a2` or `a1` were found that would adjust them; `val` is an empty list if `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, otherwise `val` is a list containing one more element, which is the tuple `(a3, l3)`; `l` is equal to `l2` if `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `l` is equal to `l1` if `a1` comes before `a2` in `l3` or if `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, otherwise, `l` is equal to `l2`. `a2` is inserted at the end of `l2` if `idx1` is less than `idx2`. If `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, `l1` has `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, and `l2` has `a2` inserted at position `idx1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is not less than the index of `a2` in `l3`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains adjusted to allow for one more iteration; `n` is at least 4; `m` is at least 3; `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22` remain unchanged from their initial values; `i` is `n - 2`; `idx1` and `idx2` remain -1 if no early break condition was met; `p1` and `p2` remain 0 if no occurrences of `a2` or `a1` were found that would adjust them; `val` is a list containing one more element, which is the tuple `(a3, l3)`; `l` is equal to `l2` if `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `l` is equal to `l1` if `a1` comes before `a2` in `l3` or if `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, otherwise, `l` is equal to `l2`. `a2` is inserted at the end of `l2` if `idx1` is less than `idx2`. If `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, `l1` has `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, and `l2` has `a2` inserted at position `idx1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is not less than the index of `a2` in `l3`; `a3` is the first integer from the input; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains adjusted to allow for one more iteration; `n` is at least 4; `m` is at least 3; `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22` remain unchanged from their initial values; `i` is `n - 2`; `idx1` and `idx2` remain -1 if no early break condition was met; `p1` and `p2` remain 0 if no occurrences of `a2` or `a1` were found that would adjust them; `val` is a list containing one more element, which is the tuple `(a3, l3)`; `l` is equal to `l2` if `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `l` is equal to `l1` if `a1` comes before `a2` in `l3` or if `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, otherwise, `l` is equal to `l2`. `a2` is inserted at the end of `l2` if `idx1` is less than `idx2`. If `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, `l1` has `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, and `l2` has `a2` inserted at position `idx1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is not less than the index of `a2` in `l3`; `a3` is the first integer from the input; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input; `val` now includes the new tuple `(a3, l3)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains adjusted to allow for one more iteration; `n` is at least 4; `m` is at least 3; `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22` remain unchanged from their initial values; `i` is `n - 2`; `idx1` and `idx2` remain -1 if no early break condition was met; `p1` and `p2` remain 0 if no occurrences of `a2` or `a1` were found that would adjust them; `val` is a list containing one more element, which is the tuple `(a3, l3)`; `l` is equal to `l2` if `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `l` is equal to `l1` if `a1` comes before `a2` in `l3` or if `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, otherwise, `l` is equal to `l2`; `a2` is inserted at the end of `l2` if `idx1` is less than `idx2`; if `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, `l1` has `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, and `l2` has `a2` inserted at position `idx1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is not less than the index of `a2` in `l3`; `a3` is the first integer from the input; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input; `val` now includes the new tuple `(a3, l3)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
