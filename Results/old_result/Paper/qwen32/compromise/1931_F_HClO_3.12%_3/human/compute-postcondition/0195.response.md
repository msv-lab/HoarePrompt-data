To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided initial state and the states after the first three iterations.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `t` is 1.
   - `n` and `m` are provided integers.
   - `a1` and `l1` are from the first input line.
   - `a2` and `l2` are from the second input line.
   - `l11` and `l22` are derived from `l1` and `l2` respectively, excluding `a2` and `a1`.
   - `idx1` and `idx2` are initialized to -1.
   - `p1` and `p2` are initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range `0` to `n-2`.
   - It breaks if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, it checks for specific conditions:
     - If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, it sets `idx1 = idx2 = i` and breaks.
     - If `l1[i + p1] == a2`, it sets `idx1 = i` and `p1 = 1`.
     - If `l2[i + p2] == a1`, it sets `idx2 = i` and `p2 = 1`.
     - If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, it breaks.

4. **Post-Iteration States:**
   - **After 1st Iteration:**
     - `i` is 0.
     - If `l1[0] != l2[0]`, it updates `idx1` and `idx2` based on the conditions.
   - **After 2nd Iteration:**
     - `i` is 1.
     - If `l1[1 + p1] != l2[1 + p2]`, it updates `idx1` and `idx2` based on the conditions.
   - **After 3rd Iteration:**
     - `i` is 2.
     - If `l1[2 + p1] != l2[2 + p2]`, it updates `idx1` and `idx2` based on the conditions.

### Final Output State:
The loop continues until either:
- `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` (condition for breaking the loop).
- `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative (indicating a match of `a2` in `l1` and `a1` in `l2` at the same relative position).

Given the loop's structure and the conditions for breaking, the final state will be determined by the point where either the loop condition is met or a match is found.

### Conclusion:
- If a match is found (`l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`), `idx1` and `idx2` will be set to the index `i` where the match occurs, and the loop will break.
- If no match is found and the loop condition is met (`i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`), the loop will break without setting `idx1` and `idx2`.

### Output State:
Assuming no match is found and the loop runs until the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is met, the final state will be:

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` and `m` are unchanged, `a1` and `l1` are unchanged, `a2` and `l2` are unchanged, `l11` and `l22` are unchanged, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1 depending on the last iteration.**

In natural language: The loop has finished executing without finding a match of `a2` in `l1` and `a1` in `l2` at the same relative position. The variables `idx1` and `idx2` remain -1, indicating no match was found. The variables `p1` and `p2` may have been set to 1 if `a2` or `a1` was encountered, respectively, during the iterations.
