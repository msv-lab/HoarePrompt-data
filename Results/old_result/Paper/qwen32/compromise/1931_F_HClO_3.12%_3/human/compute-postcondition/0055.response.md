Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 2; `m` is an integer; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l11` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a2` from `l1`; `l22` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a1` from `l2`. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is set to `i` and `p1` is set to 1. Otherwise, `idx2` is set to `i` and `p2` is set to 1. If `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of and `i` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the loop continues without breaking out.**
