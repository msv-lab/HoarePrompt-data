The only variable in the loop head of the provided for loop is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a conventional throwaway variable in Python and does not affect the loop's execution, the only variable we need to adjust is `t`.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1, as the range function will generate numbers from 0 up to, but not including, `t`. Given the problem statement, `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), which means the loop will execute as long as `t` is within this range.

Since the state before the loop starts already satisfies the condition for `t` (i.e., \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)), no adjustments are needed to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
