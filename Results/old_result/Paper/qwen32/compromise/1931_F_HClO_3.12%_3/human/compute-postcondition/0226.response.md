The code snippet `val.append((a3, l3))` adds a new tuple `(a3, l3)` to the end of the list `val`. Given the initial state, `val` already contains two tuples `(a3, l3)` and `(a3, l3)`. After appending another tuple `(a3, l3)`, `val` will now contain three tuples.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `m + 1`, `a1` and `l1` are unchanged except `l1` now contains `a1` at the end if `idx1 > idx2`, `a2` and `l2` are unchanged except `l2` now includes `a2` at the end if `idx1 < idx2`, `l11` and `l22` are unchanged, `idx1` and `idx2` are -1, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1 depending on the last iteration, `val` is a list containing three tuples `(a3, l3)` and `(a3, l3)` and `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `l` is either `l1` with `a1` inserted at `idx2` or `l2` with `a2` inserted at `idx1`, depending on the indices of `a1` and `a2` in `l3` and the condition `idx1 < idx2`**

In simpler terms, the list `val` now has three tuples, each consisting of `a3` and `l3`. All other variables retain their initial values or states.
