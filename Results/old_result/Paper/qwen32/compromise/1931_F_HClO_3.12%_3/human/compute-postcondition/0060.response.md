The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value such that the loop has just finished executing for that value of `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `n - 1`.

Given that the loop just finished executing for the current value of `i`, we need to increment `i` by 1 to start the next iteration. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `i` incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 2; `m` is an integer; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l11` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a2` from `l1`; `l22` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a1` from `l2`. `i` is incremented by 1.**
