Postcondition: **`t` remains adjusted to allow for one more iteration; `n` is at least 4; `m` is at least 3; `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22` remain unchanged from their initial values; `i` is `n - 2`; `idx1` and `idx2` remain -1 if no early break condition was met; `p1` and `p2` remain 0 if no occurrences of `a2` or `a1` were found that would adjust them; `val` is a list containing `m - 2` elements, each a tuple `(a3, l3)`; `l` is adjusted based on the conditions involving `idx1` and `idx2` after each iteration; `a2` is appended to `l2` if `idx1` is less than `idx2` after each iteration; if `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, `a1` is inserted at position `idx2` in `l1` and `a2` is inserted at position `idx1` in `l2` based on the index comparison in `l3`; `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed.**
