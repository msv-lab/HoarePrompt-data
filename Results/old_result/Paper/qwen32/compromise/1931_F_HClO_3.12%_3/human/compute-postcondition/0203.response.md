Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` and `m` are unchanged, `a1` and `l1` are unchanged except `l1` now contains `a1` at the end, `a2` and `l2` are unchanged, `l11` and `l22` are unchanged, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1 depending on the last iteration, `val` is an empty list, `l` is `l1`, and `idx1` is greater than `idx2`.**

In simple terms, the variable `l` is now assigned the value of `l1`. All other variables retain their previous values.
