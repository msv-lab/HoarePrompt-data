Initial State: `t` is 1, `n`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2` are unchanged; `a3` is the first integer from the input; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input; `m` remains 2 if it was 2; `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`; `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`; the list `l` is either `l1` with `a1` inserted at `idx2` or `l2` with `a2` inserted at `idx1`, depending on the indices of `a1` and `a2` in `l3`.

The code snippet `m -= 1` decrements the value of `m` by 1. 

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2` are unchanged; `a3` is the first integer from the input; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input; `m` is 1; `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`; `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`; the list `l` is either `l1` with `a1` inserted at `idx2` or `l2` with `a2` inserted at `idx1`, depending on the indices of `a1` and `a2` in `l3`.**
