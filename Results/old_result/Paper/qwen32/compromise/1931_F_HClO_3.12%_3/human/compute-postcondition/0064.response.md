Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 2; `m` is an integer; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l11` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a2` from `l1`; `l22` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a1` from `l2`; `i` is incremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of; `idx1` is `i`; `idx2` is `i`.**

In this output state, all the variables retain their initial values except that `i` is incremented by 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `idx1` and `idx2` are updated to the new value of `i`.
