Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the integer provided as input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `l1` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list containing the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`. If `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop or if statement has been broken out of and the current element at `l1[idx1]` is equal to `a2` and the current element at `l2[idx2]` is equal to `a1`. Otherwise, the loop or if statement continues to execute.**
