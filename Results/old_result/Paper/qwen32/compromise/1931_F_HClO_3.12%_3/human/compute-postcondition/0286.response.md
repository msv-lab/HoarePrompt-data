Postcondition: **`t` is adjusted to allow for one more iteration; `n` is at least 2; `m` is at least 5; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the latest input line; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` is 0 and `idx2` is 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged with respect to the conditions given in the precondition.**
