The value of `i` is reassigned to 1, but the values of `ar`, `same`, `minn`, `num`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ar` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 1, `same` is 1, `minn` is `inf`, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 1, `same` is 1, `minn` is `inf`, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `n` is an input integer.**
