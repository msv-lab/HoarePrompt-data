The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is either 2 or 3, after the increment, `i` will be either 3 or 4. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers with at least `i + 1` elements, `i` is either 3 or 4, `same` is either 1 or 2, `minn` is either `inf` or 1, `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the element at index `i` - 1 of `ar`, and `n` is an input integer.**
