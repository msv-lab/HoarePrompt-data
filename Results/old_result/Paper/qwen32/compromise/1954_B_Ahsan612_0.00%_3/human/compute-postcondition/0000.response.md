For the given task, the only variable in the loop head is `_` and the range is determined by `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. 

Given that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we need to ensure that the input value is within this range for the loop to execute. The variables `n` and `a` are mentioned in the problem description but are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input value (which will be assigned to `_`) is within the range of 1 to \(10^4\).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and the input value (which will be assigned to `_`) must be an integer within the range 1 to 10^4**. 

Since the loop head only involves `_` and the range is determined by `int(input())`, we can simplify this to:

State: **The input value must be an integer within the range 1 to 10^4**.
