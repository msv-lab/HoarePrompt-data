Postcondition: **`i` is less than the length of `ar`, `ar` has a length greater than 1. If `ar[i]` was equal to `num`, `same` is incremented by 1. If `ar[i]` was not equal to `num`, `i` is incremented by 1, `same` is reset to 1, `num` is set to `ar[i]`, and `minn` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the current value of `same`. If `ar[i]` was equal to `num` and `ar[i]` did not equal `num` initially, `minn` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the previous value of `same`.**
