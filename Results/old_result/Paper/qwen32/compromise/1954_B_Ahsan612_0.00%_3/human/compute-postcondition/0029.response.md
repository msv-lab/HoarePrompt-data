The provided code snippet attempts to execute `minn = min(minn, same)`. However, the initial state indicates that an `IndexError` is raised due to the condition `i` is equal to `len(ar) + 1`. This implies that there is an attempt to access an index outside the bounds of the list `ar`, which would cause the program to terminate before reaching the provided code snippet. Therefore, the line `minn = min(minn, same)` is not executed.

Since the line is not executed, the variables `minn` and `same` remain unchanged. The `IndexError` remains as a precondition that affects the execution of the program.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(ar) + 1`, `len(ar)` must be `len(ar) + 1`, an `IndexError` is raised**.
