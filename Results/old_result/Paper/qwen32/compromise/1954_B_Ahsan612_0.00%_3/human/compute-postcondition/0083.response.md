The code snippet `same = 1` sets the variable `same` to 1. This does not affect the values of any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `same` is 1, `minn` is either `inf` or a finite value that is less than or equal to the current value of `same`, and `num` is the last unique number encountered in the list; `n` is an input integer.**
