Postcondition: **The input value `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 2. If `ar[2]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 3 and `minn` remains `inf`. If `ar[2]` is not equal to `num`, then `same` is 2, `num` is updated to `ar[2]`, `minn` is set to 1, and `i` is incremented to 3. If `ar[3]` is equal to `num`, then `minn` is updated to 2. Otherwise, `minn` remains 1.**
