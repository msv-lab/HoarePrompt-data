Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is 2, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1, `num` is the element at index `i` of `ar`, `n` is an input integer, and the element at index `i` of `ar` is not equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The value of `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its current value (`inf`) and the value of `same` (which is 1). Therefore, `minn` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
