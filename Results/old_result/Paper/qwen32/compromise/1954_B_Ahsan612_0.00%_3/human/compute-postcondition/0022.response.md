Output State: **The input value `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4; `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 2; `i` is 3; `num` is `ar[3]`; `same` is 1; If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `minn` is 2; Otherwise, `minn` is 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `same` has been set to 1. The values of `n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`, and `minn` remain as they were initially, except for `same`.
