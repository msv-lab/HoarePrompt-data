The code snippet updates the value of `minn` by taking the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. Given that `minn` is initially `inf` and `same` is `1`, the minimum value will be `1`.

Output State: **The input value must be an integer within the range 1 to 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 1; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[2]`; `minn` is 1; `i` is 2; `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**
