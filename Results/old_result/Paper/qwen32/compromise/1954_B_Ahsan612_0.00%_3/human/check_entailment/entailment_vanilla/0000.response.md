Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Understanding
The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a given "beautiful" array to make it no longer "beautiful." An array is considered "beautiful" if we can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element with one of its neighbors if they are equal.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve the problem as follows:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements.
2. **Initialization**: It initializes variables `same` to 1 (to count the length of consecutive identical elements), `num` to the first element of the array (to track the current sequence of identical elements), and `minn` to infinity (to track the minimum length of any sequence of identical elements).
3. **Counting Consecutive Elements**: The program iterates through the array. When it encounters an element different from `num`, it updates `minn` with the minimum length of the current sequence of identical elements (`same`), resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the new element.
4. **Final Update**: After the loop, it performs a final update of `minn` to account for the last sequence of identical elements.
5. **Output**: If `minn` is still infinity (which should not happen given the problem constraints), it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

### Issues in the Program
The program's logic is flawed for the following reasons:
- **Incorrect Handling of Sequence Lengths**: The program only considers the minimum length of sequences of identical elements. However, the problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The provided logic does not correctly address this requirement.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, if the array is already non-beautiful (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`), it should return `0`, but the program does not account for this.
- **Minimum Elements to Remove**: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of elements to remove. It should consider the structure of the array and how removing elements affects the possibility of making all elements the same through the allowed operations.

### Correctness
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem. It does not accurately determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

**Correctness: False**
