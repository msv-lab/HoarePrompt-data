You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:
from math import ceil

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it outputs a calculated value: `k // 2 + 1` if `k` equals `4 * n - 2`, otherwise it outputs `(k + 1) // 2`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

We need to color as few cells as possible in an `n x n` grid such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell. The grid has `4n - 2` diagonals in total (consisting of `n` diagonals from the top-left to bottom-right and `n-1` diagonals from the top-right to bottom-left, and vice versa).

### Key Observations

1. **Minimum Cells to Color for `k` Diagonals:**
   - If `k <= n`, we can color one cell in each of the `k` diagonals in the top-left to bottom-right direction. This will ensure that `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - If `k > n`, then we need to color cells in the other set of diagonals (top-right to bottom-left). We can color one cell in each of the `k - n` diagonals in this direction.
   - Therefore, the minimum number of cells needed is `ceil(k / 2)` because each cell can cover at most two diagonals (one from each direction).

2. **Special Case:**
   - When `k = 4n - 2`, we need to cover all diagonals. In this case, the minimum number of cells required is `n` because each cell can cover two diagonals (one from each direction), and we need to cover `4n - 2` diagonals.

### Program Analysis

Let's analyze the provided program:

```python
from math import ceil

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))
```

#### Case 1: `k = 4n - 2`
- The program correctly handles this case by printing `k // 2 + 1`, which is `2n - 1` in this case. However, the correct answer for `k = 4n - 2` should be `n` because each cell can cover two diagonals, and we need to cover all `4n - 2` diagonals with the minimum number of cells.

#### Case 2: `k < 4n - 2`
- The program correctly prints `ceil(k / 2)`, which is the minimum number of cells required to cover at least `k` diagonals.

### Conclusion

The program incorrectly handles the special case when `k = 4n - 2`. The correct number of cells needed in this case should be `n`, not `k // 2 + 1`.

### Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the handling of the special case when `k = 4n - 2`.
