The code snippet provided only reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases that will follow, but the code does not process any further input or perform any operations on `t` other than reading it. Therefore, the only change in the state is that `t` now holds the value of the integer input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. Each of the following `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `k` such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^8 and 1 <= `k` <= 4`n` - 2.**
