In the given task, the for loop iterates `t` times. The loop variable is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable when the loop variable is not used in the loop body. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `t`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000.
- Each of the following `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `k` such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^8 and 1 <= `k` <= 4`n` - 2.

The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The values of `n` and `k` do not affect the execution of the loop itself; they only affect what happens inside the loop body, which is omitted.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The values of `n` and `k` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to make the loop execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
