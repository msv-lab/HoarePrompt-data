### Reasoning:

Let's break down the solution and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the length of the permutation) and `x` (the number to be found).
   - It then reads the permutation `p`.

2. **Mapping Indices:**
   - A dictionary `num_indx` is created to map each number in the permutation to its index (1-based).
   - A list `seen` is initialized to keep track of which elements have been encountered during the binary search.

3. **Binary Search:**
   - The binary search is performed on the permutation `p` with `left` initialized to 0 and `right` initialized to `n`.
   - During each iteration of the binary search, the middle index `mid` is calculated, and the element at `p[mid]` is marked as seen.
   - If `p[mid]` is less than or equal to `x`, `left` is updated to `mid`; otherwise, `right` is updated to `mid`.

4. **Checking the Result:**
   - If the element at `p[left]` is equal to `x`, no operations are needed, and the program outputs `0`.
   - If `x` has not been seen during the binary search, one swap operation is required to bring `x` into the correct position, and the program outputs `1` followed by the indices to be swapped.
   - If `x` has been seen but `p[left]` is not equal to `x`, two swap operations are required. The program outputs `2` followed by the indices to be swapped.

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the number of operations and the corresponding swaps as required.

### Analysis:

- The program correctly identifies if `x` can be found at the `left` index after the binary search. If so, no swaps are needed.
- If `x` has not been seen, it correctly identifies that one swap is necessary to bring `x` into the correct position.
- If `x` has been seen but is not at the `left` index, the program correctly identifies that two swaps are necessary. It selects the first unseen element and swaps it with `x` and then with the element at the `left` index.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement and performs the required operations to ensure that the binary search will find `x` at the `left` index.

**Correctness: True**
