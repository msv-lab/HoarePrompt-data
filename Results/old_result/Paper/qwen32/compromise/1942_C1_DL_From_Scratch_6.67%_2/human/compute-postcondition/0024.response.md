To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculations involved:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `T` and `t` are integers within the range 1 to 10,000. These do not affect the current print statement.
   - `n` is the first integer read from the input.
   - `x` is the second integer read from the input, and it must be greater than 1.
   - `y` is the third integer read from the input.
   - `list0` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers provided in the second line of each test case, with each integer ranging from 1 to `n`.
   - `num` is calculated as `n - list0[-1]`, where `list0[-1]` is the last element of the sorted list `list0`.
   - `count` is determined based on the value of `num`: if `num` equals 1, `count` is set to 3; otherwise, `count` remains 2.

2. **Expression to be evaluated:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `count + x - 2`.

3. **Determine the value of `count`:**
   - Since `num` is `n - list0[-1]`, and `list0` contains distinct integers up to `n`, the value of `num` depends on the position of the largest integer in `list0`.
   - If `list0[-1]` is `n-1`, then `num` would be 1, making `count` equal to 3.
   - If `list0[-1]` is `n`, then `num` would be 0, making `count` remain 2.
   - For any other value of `list0[-1]` between 1 and `n-2`, `num` would be greater than 1, making `count` remain 2.

4. **Evaluate the expression `count + x - 2`:**
   - If `count` is 3 (when `num` is 1), the expression becomes `3 + x - 2 = x + 1`.
   - If `count` is 2 (when `num` is not 1), the expression becomes `2 + x - 2 = x`.

Given these conditions, the output will depend on the value of `num`:
- If `list0[-1]` is `n-1`, the output will be `x + 1`.
- Otherwise, the output will be `x`.

Since the exact value of `list0[-1]` is not specified, we cannot definitively say whether `num` is 1 or not. Therefore, we need to account for both possibilities.

However, based on the provided information, we can describe the output in terms of the possible values of `count`:

Output: **x + 1 if list0[-1] is n-1, otherwise x (where x is the second integer read from the input)**
