Postcondition: **T is 1, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is the first integer read from the input, x is the second integer read from the input, y is the third integer read from the input, list0 is a new sorted list of x distinct integers read from the input, i is x - 1, num is n - list0[-1], and count is the number of times num was equal to 1 during the loop iterations. If num is equal to 1, count is incremented by 1.**
