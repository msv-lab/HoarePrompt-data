To determine the output of the `print(count + x - 2)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculations involved:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `T` is 1.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is the first integer read from the input.
   - `x` is the second integer read from the input.
   - `y` is the third integer read from the input (though `y` is not used in the given code snippet).
   - `list0` is a new sorted list of `x` distinct integers read from the input.
   - `i` is initialized to `x - 1`.
   - `num` is calculated as `n - list0[-1]` (which is the last element of the sorted list `list0`).
   - `count` is the number of times `num` was equal to 1 during the loop iterations. If `num` equals 1, `count` is incremented by 1.

2. **Understanding the Calculation**:
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `count + x - 2`.
   - `count` depends on how many times `num` (which is `n - list0[-1]`) equals 1 during the loop iterations.
   - `x` is the number of distinct integers in `list0`.
   - The term `x - 2` adjusts the final result based on the number of elements in `list0`.

3. **Determining the Output**:
   - Since the exact values of `n`, `x`, and the elements of `list0` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `count`.
   - However, we can express the output in terms of these variables.

Given this understanding, the output of the `print` statement can be described as follows:

Output: **count + x - 2 (where count is the number of times num was equal to 1 during the loop iterations, x is the number of distinct integers in list0, and num is calculated as n - list0[-1])**
