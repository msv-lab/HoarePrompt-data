Postcondition: **T is 1, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is the first integer read from the input, x is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 1, y is the third integer read from the input, list0 is a new sorted list of x distinct integers read from the input, i is x - 2, and if num is 1, count is 1; otherwise, count remains 0.**
