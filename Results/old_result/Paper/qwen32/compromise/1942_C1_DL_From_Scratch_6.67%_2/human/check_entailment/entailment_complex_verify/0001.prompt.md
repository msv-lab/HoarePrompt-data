You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

    #State: 
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case it receives an integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a list of `x` distinct integers ranging from 1 to `n`. It calculates and prints a value based on the gaps between the integers in the list and the boundaries defined by `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing vertices from a regular polygon with `n` sides. Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices, and we can choose up to `y` additional vertices. However, in this version of the problem, `y` is always 0, meaning we cannot choose any additional vertices.

The key points are:
- We need to form triangles using the chosen vertices.
- The triangles must be non-intersecting.
- We need to maximize the number of such triangles.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by counting the gaps between the chosen vertices and determining how many triangles can be formed based on these gaps.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:
1. **Reading Input**: It reads the number of test cases `T`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y`. Since `y` is always 0, it is ignored.
2. **Sorting Vertices**: It sorts the list of chosen vertices.
3. **Counting Gaps**: It counts the number of gaps between consecutive vertices. If the gap is exactly 1, it means there is a potential triangle that can be formed.
4. **Handling Edge Cases**: It also checks the gap between the last vertex and the first vertex (considering the polygon is circular).
5. **Calculating Triangles**: It calculates the number of triangles as `count + x - 2`.

### Issues in the Solution

Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

#### Test Case 1
```
8 4 0
1 6 2 5
```

- Sorted vertices: `[1, 2, 5, 6]`
- Gaps: 
  - Between 1 and 2: 1 (potential triangle)
  - Between 2 and 5: 2 (no triangle)
  - Between 5 and 6: 1 (potential triangle)
  - Between 6 and 1: 2 (no triangle)
- Count of gaps with 1: 2
- Number of triangles: `2 + 4 - 2 = 4`

However, the correct answer should be 2, as shown in the example.

#### Test Case 2
```
8 8 0
1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
```

- Sorted vertices: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`
- Gaps:
  - Between 1 and 2: 1 (potential triangle)
  - Between 2 and 3: 1 (potential triangle)
  - Between 3 and 4: 1 (potential triangle)
  - Between 4 and 5: 1 (potential triangle)
  - Between 5 and 6: 1 (potential triangle)
  - Between 6 and 7: 1 (potential triangle)
  - Between 7 and 8: 1 (potential triangle)
  - Between 8 and 1: 1 (potential triangle)
- Count of gaps with 1: 8
- Number of triangles: `8 + 8 - 2 = 14`

However, the correct answer should be 6, as shown in the example.

### Conclusion

The provided solution incorrectly assumes that every gap of 1 between chosen vertices corresponds to a unique triangle. This is not true because the triangles must be non-intersecting, and the solution does not account for this constraint properly.

Therefore, the solution is incorrect.
