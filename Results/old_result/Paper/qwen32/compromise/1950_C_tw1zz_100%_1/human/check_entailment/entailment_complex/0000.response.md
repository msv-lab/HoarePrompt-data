### Reasoning:

The provided program correctly handles the conversion of time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format by using a series of conditional checks for each possible hour value. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, each time reading a time string in the format "hh:mm".

2. **Splitting Time**: For each time string, it splits the string into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`).

3. **Conditional Checks**: The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to map the 24-hour format hours to the 12-hour format hours and determine whether the time is "AM" or "PM".

4. **Output**: For each time, it prints the converted time in the format "hh:mm AM/PM".

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Mapping**: The mapping of hours from 24-hour to 12-hour format is correctly implemented. For example, `13:00` is correctly converted to `01:00 PM`, and `00:00` is correctly converted to `12:00 AM`.

- **Handling Leading Zeros**: The program maintains leading zeros in the output, as seen in the output examples (`09:41 AM` instead of `9:41 AM`).

- **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases such as `00:00` (midnight) and `12:00` (noon).

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format according to the problem description and handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Your response:
Correctness: **True**
