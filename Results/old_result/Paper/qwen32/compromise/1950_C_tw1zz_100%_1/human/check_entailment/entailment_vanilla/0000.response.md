### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to convert a given time in 24-hour format to its equivalent in 12-hour format. Let's analyze the correctness of the program by examining its logic and comparing it to the requirements.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the time in the format `hh:mm` and splits it into hours `h` and minutes `m`.

2. **Conversion Logic:**
   - The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to map the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format.
   - It correctly identifies the hour and assigns the appropriate period (AM/PM) based on the 24-hour input.
   - For hours from `01` to `11`, it assigns the same hour with "AM".
   - For `12`, it assigns "12 PM".
   - For hours from `13` to `23`, it subtracts 12 from the hour to convert it to the 12-hour format and assigns "PM".
   - For `00`, it assigns "12 AM".

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the converted hour, minutes, and period (AM/PM) in the correct format.

### Potential Issues:

- **Redundant Code:**
  - The conversion logic can be simplified using a more efficient approach, such as using arithmetic operations to determine the 12-hour format and period.
  - However, the current implementation correctly handles all possible cases, so it is not incorrect per se.

- **Output Formatting:**
  - The program uses `sep=''` in the `print` function to ensure that the output is formatted as required, with no extra spaces.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
