The given code snippet calculates the value of `rx` using the formula `rx = (-a % x + x) % x`. However, the variable `a` is not defined in the initial state. Since `a` is not provided, we can't compute a specific numerical value for `rx`. We will assume `a` is a variable that could be part of the `arr` list or another variable in the context not provided here.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the only change is the introduction of the variable `rx` with a value dependent on `a`, `x`, and the modulo operation.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and there is at least one more tuple to process with `arr` being a non-empty list; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `freq` is an empty dictionary; `count` is 0; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`.**
