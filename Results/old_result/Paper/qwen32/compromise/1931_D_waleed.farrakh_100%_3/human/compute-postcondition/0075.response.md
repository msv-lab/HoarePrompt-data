The given code snippet calculates `rx` using the formula `(-a % x + x) % x`. However, the variable `a` is not defined in the initial state provided. Assuming `a` is an element from the array `arr` (as it is common in such problems), we will proceed with this assumption.

Given the initial state, the variable `rx` is introduced and calculated, but no other variables in the initial state are affected by this calculation. Therefore, the output state will include the new variable `rx` with its calculated value.

Let's assume `a` is the first element of `arr` for the calculation. The output state will then be:

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and the first tuple from the previous iteration has been removed; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` after all iterations and the newly appended `count` value; `freq` is an empty dictionary; `count` is 0; `arr` must have at least one element; `rx` is `(-arr[0] % x + x) % x`**.

In natural language: The output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `rx` that holds the value calculated using the formula `(-arr[0] % x + x) % x`.
