The code snippet provided updates the `arr` variable by converting the string at `data[idx + 1]` into a list of integers. The other variables (`test_cases`, `data`, `t`, `idx`, `n`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged.

Let's break it down:

1. `arr` was initially a list of integers derived from `data[idx + 1]` but not explicitly defined in the initial state.
2. The code snippet explicitly defines `arr` as a list of integers by splitting `data[idx + 1]` by spaces and converting each split string into an integer.

Since `idx` is 5, `arr` is now defined as `list(map(int, data[6].split()))`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list containing two tuples `((n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr))`, `data` is a list of strings with at least one element where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0]) - 2` and must be greater than 0, `idx` is 5, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first, second, and third integers from `data[5]` split by spaces, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[6]` split by spaces and converted to integers.**
