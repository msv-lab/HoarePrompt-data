The code snippet assigns the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` by splitting the string at `data[idx]` and converting each part to an integer. Given that `idx` is 1, `data[1]` is expected to be a string containing three space-separated integers.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an empty list, `data` is a list of strings with at least one element where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and must be greater than 0, `idx` is 1, `n` is the first integer from `data[1]` split by spaces, `x` is the second integer from `data[1]` split by spaces, `y` is the third integer from `data[1]` split by spaces.**

In natural language: The output state remains the same as the initial state except that `n`, `x`, and `y` are now assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the string at `data[1]` into three parts and converting each part to an integer.
