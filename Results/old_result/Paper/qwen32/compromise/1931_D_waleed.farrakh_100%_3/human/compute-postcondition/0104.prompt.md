Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and the first tuple from the previous iteration has been removed; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` after all iterations and the newly appended `count` value; `freq` is an empty dictionary; `count` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for a in arr:
    rx = (-a % x + x) % x
    ry = a % y
    if (rx, ry) in freq:
        count += freq[rx, ry]
    current_pair = a % x, a % y
    if current_pair in freq:
        freq[current_pair] += 1
    else:
        freq[current_pair] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and the first tuple from the previous iteration has been removed; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` after all iterations and the newly appended `count` value; `freq` is a dictionary that may or may not contain the key `(rx, ry)`. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, the value for the key `(rx, ry)` is incremented by 1 and `count` is updated to `count + freq[rx, ry]`. If `current_pair` is not in `freq`, `freq[current_pair]` is set to 1; `arr` must have at least one element; `rx` is `(-arr[0] % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, with the first tuple removed from the previous iteration; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the newly appended `count` value; `freq` is a dictionary that may or may not contain the key `(rx, ry)`. If `current_pair` was already in `freq`, its value is incremented by 1. If `current_pair` was not in `freq`, it is added with the value `1`; `arr` must have at least one element; `rx` is `(-arr[0] % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(arr[0] % x, arr[0] % y)`; `a` is `arr[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, with the first tuple removed from the previous iteration; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the newly appended `count` value; `freq` is a dictionary that may or may not contain the key `(rx, ry)`. If `current_pair` was already in `freq`, its value is incremented by 1 and `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[(rx, ry)]`. If `current_pair` was not in `freq`, it is added with the value `1`. `arr` must have at least one element; `a` is the next element in `arr`; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
