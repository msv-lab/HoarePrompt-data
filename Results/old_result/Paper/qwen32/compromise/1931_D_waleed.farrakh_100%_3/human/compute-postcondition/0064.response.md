Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and there is at least one more tuple to process with `arr` being a non-empty list; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `a` is the next element in `arr` that has not been processed yet. If `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `count` is incremented by `freq[rx, ry] + 1`. If `(rx, ry)` is not in `freq`, `count` remains unchanged.**
