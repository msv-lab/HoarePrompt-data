Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n (an integer representing the size of the array), x (an integer representing Polycarp's first favorite integer), y (an integer representing Polycarp's second favorite integer), and arr (a list of n integers representing the elements of the array); `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    freq = {}
    count = 0
    for a in arr:
        rx = (-a % x + x) % x
        ry = a % y
        if (rx, ry) in freq:
            count += freq[rx, ry]
        current_pair = a % x, a % y
        if current_pair in freq:
            freq[current_pair] += 1
        else:
            freq[current_pair] = 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary with counts of all unique pairs `(a % x, a % y)` from the array `arr`; `count` is the total number of times pairs `(rx, ry)` have been seen before in the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and there is at least one more tuple to process; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` after all iterations and the newly appended `count` value; `freq` is a dictionary with keys as `(a % x, a % y)` and values as the number of times each pair appears in `arr`; `count` is the final sum of all values in `freq` that were added to it during the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is an empty list; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the current value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of all pairs `(rx, ry)` encountered; `count` is the final accumulated count.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
