You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n (an integer representing the size of the array), x (an integer representing Polycarp's first favorite integer), y (an integer representing Polycarp's second favorite integer), and arr (a list of n integers representing the elements of the array). It is guaranteed that for each tuple, 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element a_i in arr.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    t = int(data[0])
    test_cases = []
    idx = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())
        
        arr = list(map(int, data[idx + 1].split()))
        
        test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
        
        idx += 2
        
    #State: `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, `data` is a list of strings, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, and `idx` is `2 * t + 1`.
    results = func_1(test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, `data` is a list of strings, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `idx` is `2 * t + 1`, and all elements in `results` have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains four elements: `n` (the size of the array), `x` (Polycarp's first favorite integer), `y` (Polycarp's second favorite integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers representing the elements of the array). For each tuple, the function returns a result based on the given constraints. The specific return value is not detailed in the provided information, but it is implied that the function processes each test case and returns some output related to the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
