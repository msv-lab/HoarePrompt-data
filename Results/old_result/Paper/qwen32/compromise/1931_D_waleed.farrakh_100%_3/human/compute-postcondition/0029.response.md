Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains four elements: `n` (the size of the array), `x` (Polycarp's first favorite integer), `y` (Polycarp's second favorite integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers representing the elements of the array). For each tuple, the function returns a result based on the given constraints. The specific return value is not detailed in the provided information, but it is implied that the function processes each test case and returns some output related to the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.**
