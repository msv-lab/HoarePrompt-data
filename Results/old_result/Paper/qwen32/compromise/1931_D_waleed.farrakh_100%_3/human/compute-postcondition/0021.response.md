The code snippet provided calls a function `func_1` with `test_cases` as its argument. The return value of `func_1` is assigned to the variable `results`. The values of `test_cases`, `data`, `t`, and `idx` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by `func_1`. However, based on the information given, `func_1` has not been defined in this context, so we can only assume that it processes `test_cases` and returns some result.

Given that `func_1` is called, `results` will hold whatever `func_1` returns. Since the function and its behavior are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `results`. We can only state that `results` has been assigned the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, `data` is a list of strings, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `idx` is `2 * t + 1`, and `results` is the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`**.
