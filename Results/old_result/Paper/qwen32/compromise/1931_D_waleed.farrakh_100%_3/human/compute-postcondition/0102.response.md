The code snippet `freq[current_pair] = 1` sets the value of `freq[current_pair]` to 1. This means that if `current_pair` was already in the dictionary `freq`, its value is overwritten to be 1. If `current_pair` was not in `freq`, it is added with the value 1. No other variables are affected by this statement.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, with the first tuple removed from the previous iteration; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the newly appended `count` value; `freq` is a dictionary that may or may not contain the key `(rx, ry)`, and `freq[current_pair]` is 1; `arr` must have at least one element; `a` is the next element in `arr`; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`**.
