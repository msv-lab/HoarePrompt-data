test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case and contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers (a). Specifically, for each test case, 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all a_i in the list a. The total number of elements across all lists a in all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
