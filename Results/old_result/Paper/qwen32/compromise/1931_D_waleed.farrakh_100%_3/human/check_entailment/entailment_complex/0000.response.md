### Reasoning:

The program is structured into two main functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. Here's a detailed breakdown of how each function operates and whether they collectively meet the problem requirements:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is responsible for reading the input from standard input and parsing it into a list of test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to read each test case's parameters: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
   - Each test case is stored as a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` in the list `test_cases`.
   - After parsing the input, it calls `func_1` with the `test_cases` list.
   - It then prints the results returned by `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes each test case to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array `arr`.
   - For each test case, it initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs of remainders `(rx, ry)` where `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` and `ry = a % y`.
   - It iterates over each element `a` in the array `arr`:
     - It calculates the remainders `rx` and `ry`.
     - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in `freq`. If it is, it adds the frequency of this pair to the `count`.
     - It then updates the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.
   - After processing all elements in the array, it appends the `count` for the current test case to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list containing the counts for all test cases.

### Verification of Correctness:

- **Input Parsing**: `func_2` correctly reads and parses the input according to the problem description.
- **Logic for Counting Beautiful Pairs**: `func_1` correctly implements the logic to count beautiful pairs by using a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of pairs of remainders. The condition `a_i + a_j` being divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` being divisible by `y` is translated into checking for the presence of specific pairs of remainders.
- **Efficiency**: The approach is efficient given the constraints. The use of dictionaries ensures that the counting process is done in linear time relative to the number of elements in the array, which is crucial given the upper bound of \(2 \times 10^5\) for the total number of elements across all test cases.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It reads the input, processes each test case to count the beautiful pairs, and outputs the results accurately.

**Correctness: True**
