Output State: **`a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is `a[i]`, `kq2` is `a[i]`, `vt` is 0, `x` and `y` are the minimum and maximum of the last compared characters, `t` remains unchanged, `q` is incremented by 1, and `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the code inside the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, all variables retain their previous values and states.
