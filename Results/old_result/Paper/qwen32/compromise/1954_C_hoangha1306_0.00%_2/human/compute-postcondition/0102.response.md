Postcondition: **`a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `t` remains unchanged, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are each concatenated with the character `a[i]`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `vt` was 0, `vt` is set to 1, and `kq1` and `kq2` are updated with the string representations of `y` and `x` respectively if `a[i] > b[i]`, or `x` and `y` respectively if `a[i] <= b[i]`. If `vt` was not 0, `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + str(y)` and `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + str(x)` regardless of the comparison between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**
