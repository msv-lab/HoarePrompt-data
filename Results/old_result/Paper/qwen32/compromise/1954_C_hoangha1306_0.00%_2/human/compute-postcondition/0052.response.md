Initial State: `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `t` is greater than 0; `a` is the value of the user input and has a length greater than 0; `b` is the value of the user input; `i` is 2; `vt` is 1; `kq1` is `kq1 + str(y)`

The code snippet is:
```
kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
```

Impact: The value of `kq2` is updated by appending the string representation of `x` to it. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `t` is greater than 0; `a` is the value of the user input and has a length greater than 0; `b` is the value of the user input; `i` is 2; `vt` is 1; `kq1` is `kq1 + str(y)`; `kq2` is `kq2 + str(x)`**.

In simple terms: The output state is the same as the initial state, except that `kq2` now includes the string representation of `x` appended to it.
