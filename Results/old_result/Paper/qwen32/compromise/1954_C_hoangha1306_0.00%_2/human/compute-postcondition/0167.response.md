The code snippet assigns the minimum and maximum values between the integer conversions of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x` and `y`, respectively. Given the initial state, `i` is `i + 1`, which means `i` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Therefore, `x` will be the smaller of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `y` will be the larger of these two values.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`; `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`.**
