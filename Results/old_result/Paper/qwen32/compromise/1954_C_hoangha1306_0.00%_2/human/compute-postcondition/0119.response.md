To determine what will be printed by the `print(kq1)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the context in which `kq1` is constructed. However, the initial state provided does not give explicit details on how `kq1` is constructed. It only mentions that `kq1` is "the constructed string based on the rules."

Since the exact rules for constructing `kq1` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given information.

Given:
- `kq1` is a constructed string based on some rules.
- `kq2` is also a constructed string based on some rules.
- `vt` is 1 if there was at least one differing character, otherwise 0.
- `x` and `y` are the last compared minimum and maximum values.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `q` is the length of the string `a`.

The `print(kq1)` statement will print the value of `kq1`, which is a string constructed according to some rules that are not detailed in the initial state.

Output: **kq1 (where kq1 is a constructed string based on the rules)**
