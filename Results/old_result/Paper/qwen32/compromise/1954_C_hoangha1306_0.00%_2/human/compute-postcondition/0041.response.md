Postcondition: **`x` is the minimum of the first digit of `a` and the first digit of `b`; `y` is the maximum of the first digit of `a` and the first digit of `b`; `t` is greater than 0; `a` is the value of the user input and has a length greater than 0; `b` is the value of the user input; `i` is 1; `vt` is 1 if the initial condition `vt == 0` was false, otherwise `vt` remains unchanged; `kq1` is the string representation of `x` if `a[i] <= b[i]` and `vt` was initially 0, otherwise `kq1` is the string representation of `y`; `kq2` is the string representation of `y` concatenated with the string representation of `x` if `vt` was initially 0, otherwise `kq2` is the previous value of `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `x`.**
