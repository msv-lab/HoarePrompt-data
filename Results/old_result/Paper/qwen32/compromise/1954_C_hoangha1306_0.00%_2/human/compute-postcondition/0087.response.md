Postcondition: **`a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `t` remains unchanged, and `q` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to `a[i]` and `vt` remains 0. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `kq1` is the string representation of `x` while `kq2` is the string representation of `y` if `a[i]` is less than or equal to `b[i]`; otherwise, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`. If `vt` was 0, it is now 1. If `vt` was not 0, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated as described regardless of the previous value of `vt`.**
