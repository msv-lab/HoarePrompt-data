The variable `kq1` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `y` to its current value. The values of `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`; `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`; `kq1` is `kq1` + `str(y)`**.
