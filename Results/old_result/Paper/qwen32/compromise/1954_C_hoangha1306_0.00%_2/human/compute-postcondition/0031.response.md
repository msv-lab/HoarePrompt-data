The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. However, since there is no loop structure in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the program state.

Therefore, none of the variables (`x`, `y`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `kq1`, `kq2`) are changed by the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and they have the same length; `t` is greater than 0; `a` is the value of the user input and has a length greater than 0; `b` is the value of the user input; `i` is 1; `kq1` is `kq1` (initial value) + the integer value of `a[1]`; `kq2` is `kq2` (initial value) + the integer value of `a[1]`.**
