You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly solves the problem.

The problem requires us to maximize the product of two numbers, `x` and `y`, by swapping corresponding digits between them. The strategy to maximize the product is to ensure that the higher digits are placed in the higher significant positions in either `x` or `y`.

The provided program seems to follow a different logic. It tries to swap digits such that the first number (`kq1`) always has the larger digit in the first mismatched position, and the second number (`kq2`) has the smaller digit. After the first mismatch, it reverses the strategy, always putting the larger digit in `kq2` and the smaller digit in `kq1`. This strategy is not guaranteed to maximize the product.

Let's consider an example to illustrate why this strategy might not work:
- Suppose we have `x = 98` and `y = 12`.
- The program will first swap the digits because `9 > 1`, so `kq1 = 1` and `kq2 = 9`.
- Then it will see `8 > 2` and since `vt` is now `1`, it will put `2` in `kq1` and `8` in `kq2`, resulting in `kq1 = 12` and `kq2 = 98`.
- The product here is `12 * 98 = 1176`.

However, the optimal solution would be to swap the digits in the first place, resulting in `x = 18` and `y = 92`, producing a product of `18 * 92 = 1656`, which is larger.

The provided program does not maximize the product, and thus it is incorrect.

Reasoning: The program does not follow a strategy that guarantees the maximum product. It simply alternates between assigning the larger and smaller digit to `kq1` and `kq2` after the first mismatch, which does not necessarily lead to the maximum product.

Correctness: **False**
