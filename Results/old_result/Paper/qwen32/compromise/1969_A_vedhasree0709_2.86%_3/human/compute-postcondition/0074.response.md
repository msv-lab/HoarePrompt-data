To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `i` and `n`.

The loop condition is `while i <= n - 1:`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `j` is 2 if `l[i + 1] == i + 3` and `l[i + 2] == i + 2`, otherwise `j` remains unchanged.
- `i` is increased by 1.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `i` is still less than or equal to `n - 1` after the increment of `i`. Therefore, after the increment, `i` should be less than or equal to `n - 1`.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. After the increment, `i` becomes `i_prev + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i_prev + 1` should be less than or equal to `n - 1`. This can be rewritten as `i_prev <= n - 2`.

Hence, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `n` to be at least `i + 2` (since `i` is incremented by 1 in the next iteration).

State: **`j` is 2 if `l[i + 1] == i + 3` and `l[i + 2] == i + 2`, otherwise `j` remains unchanged; `i` is increased by 1; `n` must be at least `i + 2`**
