The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The condition for `j` remains unchanged and depends on the values of `l[i]` and `l[i + 1]` after the increment of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 2 if `l[i + 1] == i + 3` and `l[i + 2] == i + 2`, otherwise `j` remains unchanged; `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`j` is 2 if `l[i + 1] == i + 3` and `l[i + 2] == i + 2`, otherwise `j` remains unchanged; `i` is increased by 1.**
