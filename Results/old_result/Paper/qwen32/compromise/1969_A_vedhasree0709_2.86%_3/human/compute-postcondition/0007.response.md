Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `l[i]` equals `i + 2` and `l[i + 1]` equals `i + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print(2)` is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `j`, `l[i]`, or `l[i + 1]`. It simply prints the number 2.

### Output:
Output: **2**
