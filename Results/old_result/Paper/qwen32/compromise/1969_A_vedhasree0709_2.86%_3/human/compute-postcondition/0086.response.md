Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it checks if there are any two consecutive integers in the list `p` such that `p[i] = i + 2` and `p[i + 1] = i + 1`. If such a pair is found, it prints `2`; otherwise, it prints `3`.**
