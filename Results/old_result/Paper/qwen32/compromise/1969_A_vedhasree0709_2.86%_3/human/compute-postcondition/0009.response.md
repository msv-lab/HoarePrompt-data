Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `l[i]` equals `i + 2` and `l[i + 1]` equals `i + 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that the program will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is within.
