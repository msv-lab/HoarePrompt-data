The code sets `i` to 0, which overrides the previous value of `i` which was `n`. The values of `j`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0 if no index `i` in the list `l` satisfies `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`. Otherwise, `j` is 1; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers from the input.**
