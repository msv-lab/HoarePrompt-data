The code provided is a `break` statement, which will terminate the innermost loop or if statement it is placed in. However, since no loop or if statement is provided in the code snippet, the `break` statement itself does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `j`, `n`, or `l`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers from the input, the current value of `l[i]` (which is `l[0]`) is 2, and the current value of `l[i + 1]` (which is `l[1]`) is 1.**
