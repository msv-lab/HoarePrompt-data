Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000; `n` is greater than or equal to 3; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 2. If `l[i]` equals `i + 2` and `l[i + 1]` equals `i + 1`, then `j` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no changes are made to `j` or the loop is not exited.**
