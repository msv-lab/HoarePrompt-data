In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the input `t`, which specifies the number of test cases. The loop will execute `t` times. The variables `n` and `p` are defined within each iteration of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted in the initial state before the loop starts.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop is controlled by the variable `_` (which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not use) and the range is determined by `int(input())`. This means the loop will execute as many times as the integer value provided by the input.

2. The initial state before the loop starts only needs to ensure that the input `t` is set correctly, as this is the only variable in the loop head that we can adjust.

3. The variables `n` and `p` are defined inside the loop body and do not need to be part of the initial state before the loop starts.

Given this, the initial state only needs to ensure that `t` is set to a valid integer value between 1 and 5000.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000**
