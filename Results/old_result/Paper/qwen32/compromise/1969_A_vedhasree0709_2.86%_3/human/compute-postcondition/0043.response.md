Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000; `n` must be at least 2; `l` is the list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The only impact of the code is that it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
