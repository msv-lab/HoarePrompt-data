The code snippet provided only reassigns the value of `j` to 0. Since `j` was already 0 based on the initial state, this operation does not change the value of `j`. Therefore, the only impact of the code is that it confirms `j` is 0, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is the list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 0.**
