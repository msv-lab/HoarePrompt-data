You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        i = 0
        
        j = 0
        
        while i <= n - 1:
            if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1:
                print(2)
                j = 1
                break
            i += 1
        
        if j == 0:
            print(3)
        
    #State: t test cases processed, each resulting in either a print of 2 or 3 based on the condition, with i being n and j being 0 or 1 at the end of each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it checks if there are any two consecutive integers in the list `p` such that `p[i] = i + 2` and `p[i + 1] = i + 1`. If such a pair is found, it prints `2`; otherwise, it prints `3`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program against the problem statement to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
Monocarp wants to invite friends to a party such that at least two of them attend. Each friend `i` has a best friend `p_i` (where `p_i` is distinct and `p_i != i`). For friend `i` to attend, both `i` and `p_i` must receive invitations.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem but does not correctly implement the logic required. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list `l` representing the best friends `p_i`.

2. **Logic**:
   - The program initializes two variables `i` and `j` to `0`.
   - It then enters a `while` loop that iterates through the list `l`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`. This condition is supposed to identify pairs of friends who are each other's best friends.
   - If the condition is met, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop. This is because if two friends are each other's best friends, inviting both will ensure that both attend the party.
   - If the condition is not met for any pair, it prints `3` after the loop.

### Issues:
- The condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` is incorrect for identifying pairs of friends who are each other's best friends. It assumes a specific ordering and relationship that does not hold in general.
- The program does not handle cases where the optimal solution might involve more than two invitations but still results in at least two friends attending.
- The program does not consider all possible pairs and their relationships, which is necessary to find the minimum number of invitations required.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
