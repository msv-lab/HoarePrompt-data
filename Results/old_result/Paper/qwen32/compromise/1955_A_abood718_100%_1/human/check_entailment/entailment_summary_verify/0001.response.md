Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description, code, and function summary.

### Problem Recap:
- Maxim needs to buy exactly `n` yogurts.
- The price for one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The price for two yogurts on promotion is `b` burles.
- Determine the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy `n` yogurts.

### Key Observations:
1. **If `2 * a < b`:** It's cheaper to buy yogurts individually. Hence, the cost is `n * a`.
2. **If `2 * a >= b`:** It's cheaper or equally expensive to buy yogurts in pairs.
   - If `n` is even, the cost is `(n / 2) * b`.
   - If `n` is odd, the cost is `((n - 1) / 2) * b + a` (buy as many pairs as possible and one individual yogurt).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows the above logic with the following steps:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Decision Making:**
   - It first checks if `2 * a < b`. If true, it calculates the cost as `n * a` and prints it.
   - If `2 * a >= b`, it checks if `n` is even. If true, it calculates the cost as `(n / 2) * b` and prints it.
   - If `n` is odd, it calculates the cost as `((n - 1) / 2) * b + a` and prints it.

### Code Review:
The code provided does not exactly match the decision-making logic described above. Specifically:
- The condition `if B * 2 < C` is correct for determining if buying individually is cheaper.
- However, the else part does not correctly handle the odd `n` case. Instead of checking if `n` is even or odd, it directly computes `X = A // 2` and prints `X * C + B`. This is incorrect because it doesn't properly handle the scenario where `n` is odd.

### Corrected Code:
To fix the code, we should properly handle the odd `n` case. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        else:
            # Calculate the number of pairs and the remaining yogurt
            pairs = A // 2
            remaining = A % 2
            print(pairs * C + remaining * B)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the improper handling of the odd `n` case. Therefore, the Correctness is:

Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was accurate in identifying that the program incorrectly handles the case where `n` is odd. Therefore, the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
