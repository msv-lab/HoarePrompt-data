Let's analyze the given program step by step based on the problem description:

The task is to determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts, given the price of one yogurt (`a`) and the price for two yogurts on promotion (`b`). The program should handle multiple test cases.

Here is the provided program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

Let's break down the logic in the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates through each test case, reading the values `n`, `a`, and `b` for each one.

2. **Decision Making**:
    - **Condition 1**: `if B * 2 < C`
        - This checks if buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than buying them on promotion. If true, it prints the cost of buying `n` yogurts individually, which is `A * B`.
    - **Condition 2**: `elif A % 2 == 0`
        - This checks if the number of yogurts `n` is even. If true, it prints the cost of buying all yogurts in pairs, which is `(A * C) / 2`.
    - **Else Condition**:
        - If the number of yogurts `n` is odd, it calculates the cost as the cost of buying the maximum number of pairs `(A // 2)` and one additional yogurt at the individual price `B`. This is calculated as `X * C + B`.

Let's verify if the logic correctly handles all edge cases:

- **When `n` is even**:
    - The program correctly calculates the cost as `(n * b) / 2` if `b` is cheaper than buying two yogurts individually.
- **When `n` is odd**:
    - The program calculates the cost as `(n // 2 * b) + a` which is correct, as it buys as many pairs as possible and one yogurt individually if necessary.
- **When `b` is more expensive than buying two yogurts individually**:
    - The program correctly calculates the cost as `n * a`.

The program is correctly handling all the conditions mentioned in the problem statement.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
