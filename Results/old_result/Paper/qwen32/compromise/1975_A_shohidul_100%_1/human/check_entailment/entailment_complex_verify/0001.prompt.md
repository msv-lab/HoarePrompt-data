You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

    #State: All test cases have been processed and evaluated for whether the array `a` can be considered non-decreasing by potentially removing a prefix.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function evaluates multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines if the array can be made non-decreasing by potentially removing a prefix of the array. It prints 'YES' if the array can be made non-decreasing in this manner, otherwise it prints 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine if an array `a` can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where we split the array into a prefix and a suffix and then swap these two parts.
- The operation can be performed any number of times, including zero times.
- For each test case, we need to output "Yes" if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order using the operation, otherwise "No".

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `a`.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - It checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the condition `all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`.
   - If the array is already sorted, it prints "YES" and moves to the next test case.

3. **Checking for Possible Swaps:**
   - If the array is not initially sorted, the program iterates through the array to find the first position `i` where `a[i - 1] > a[i]`.
   - It then considers the subarray starting from this position `i` to the end (`new = a[i:]`).
   - It checks two conditions:
     - `check_all_new`: All elements in `new` should be less than or equal to the first element of the original array `a[0]`.
     - `new_all`: The subarray `new` should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES" and breaks out of the loop.
   - If either condition fails, it prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop.

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic for checking possible swaps is flawed. The program only checks if the subarray `new` can be moved to the front while maintaining the non-decreasing property, but it does not consider other possible splits and swaps.
- Specifically, the program does not handle cases where the array can be split and rearranged in more complex ways to achieve a sorted order.

### Example Issue:
Consider the array `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`:
- The program will find the first inversion at `i = 1` (since `3 > 1`).
- It will then consider the subarray `[1, 4, 1, 5]`.
- It will check if `[1, 4, 1, 5]` can be moved to the front with `3` being greater than or equal to all elements in `[1, 4, 1, 5]`, which is not true.
- Therefore, it will incorrectly print "NO" for this case.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly handle all possible scenarios for rearranging the array using the allowed operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
