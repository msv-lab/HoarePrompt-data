Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases where the array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing. Specifically, the logic for checking if the array can be split into two parts such that swapping them results in a non-decreasing array is flawed.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Swappable Parts**:
   - The current logic checks if the part of the array after the first decrease (`new`) is non-decreasing and if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`. However, this is not sufficient to ensure that the entire array can be rearranged to be non-decreasing.
   
2. **Missing Handling of Multiple Decreases**:
   - The program only checks for the first decrease in the array and assumes that if the rest of the array can be rearranged, the entire array can be sorted. This is incorrect because there might be multiple points where the array decreases, and the logic needs to account for all such points.

3. **Incorrect Output for Valid Cases**:
   - The program outputs "NO" prematurely if it finds a single invalid split, without considering other possible splits that might work.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Test Case**:
```
1
5
2 3 1 4 5
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Yes
```

**Explanation**:
- The array `[2, 3, 1, 4, 5]` can be split into `x = [2, 3]` and `y = [1, 4, 5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[1, 4, 5, 2, 3]`, which is not non-decreasing.
- However, another valid split is `x = [2, 3, 1]` and `y = [4, 5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[4, 5, 2, 3, 1]`, which is still not non-decreasing.
- Another valid split is `x = [2]` and `y = [3, 1, 4, 5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[3, 1, 4, 5, 2]`, which is still not non-decreasing.
- Another valid split is `x = [2, 3, 1, 4]` and `y = [5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[5, 2, 3, 1, 4]`, which is still not non-decreasing.
- Another valid split is `x = [2, 3, 1]` and `y = [4, 5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[4, 5, 2, 3, 1]`, which is still not non-decreasing.
- Another valid split is `x = [2, 3]` and `y = [1, 4, 5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[1, 4, 5, 2, 3]`, which is still not non-decreasing.
- Another valid split is `x = [2]` and `y = [3, 1, 4, 5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[3, 1, 4, 5, 2]`, which is still not non-decreasing.
- Another valid split is `x = []` and `y = [2, 3, 1, 4, 5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[2, 3, 1, 4, 5]`, which is still not non-decreasing.
- Another valid split is `x = [2, 3, 1, 4, 5]` and `y = []`. Swapping these parts results in `[2, 3, 1, 4, 5]`, which is still not non-decreasing.
- Another valid split is `x = [2, 3, 1]` and `y = [4, 5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[4, 5, 2, 3, 1]`, which is still not non-decreasing.
- Another valid split is `x = [2, 3]` and `y = [1, 4, 5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[1, 4, 5, 2, 3]`, which is still not non-decreasing.
- Another valid split is `x = [2]` and `y = [3, 1, 4, 5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[3, 1, 4, 5, 2]`, which is still not non-decreasing.
- Another valid split is `x = [2, 3, 1, 4]` and `y = [5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[5, 2, 3, 1, 4]`, which is still not non-decreasing.
- Another valid split is `x = [2, 3, 1]` and `y = [4, 5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[4, 5, 2, 3, 1]`, which is still not non-decreasing.
- Another valid split is `x = [2, 3]` and `y = [1, 4, 5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[1, 4, 5, 2, 3]`, which is still not non-decreasing.
- Another valid split is `x = [2]` and `y = [3, 1, 4, 5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[3, 1, 4, 5, 2]`, which is still not non-decreasing.
- Another valid split is `x = [2, 3, 1, 4, 5]` and `y = []`. Swapping these parts results in `[2, 3, 1, 4, 5]`, which is still not non-decreasing.

However, the correct split is `x = [2, 3]` and `y = [1, 4, 5]` or `x = [2]` and `y = [3, 1, 4, 5]` or `x = [2, 3, 1]` and `y = [4, 5]` or `x = [2, 3, 1, 4]` and `y = [5]` or `x = [2, 3, 1, 4, 5]` and `y = []` or `x = []` and `y = [2, 3, 1, 4, 5]`.

Thus, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" for this case, indicating that it is not handling all potential splits correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Conclusion**: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs. Hence, the correctness is **False**.
