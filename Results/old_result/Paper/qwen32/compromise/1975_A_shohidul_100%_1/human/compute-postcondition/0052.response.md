The given code snippet checks if all elements in the sublist `new` are non-decreasing (each element is less than or equal to the next one). This is done using the `all()` function combined with a list comprehension.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than or equal to 2
- `n` is greater than 1
- `a` is a list of integers
- `check_all` is False
- `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`
- `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of the list
- `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`

The code snippet:
```python
new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
```
assigns to `new_all` the result of checking if every element in `new` is less than or equal to the subsequent element.

Since `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` and `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, it suggests that the sublist `new` starts with a decreasing pair relative to the original list `a`. However, the code checks if `new` itself is non-decreasing.

Therefore, the value of `new_all` will be `True` if all elements in `new` are non-decreasing, otherwise it will be `False`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is False, `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of the list, `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are non-decreasing.**
