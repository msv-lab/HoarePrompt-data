Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's analyze what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `n` is greater than 4.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `i` is set to 4.
- `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index 4 to the end.
- `check_all_new` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`.
- `new_all` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.
- There is a break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- `new_all` is updated to reflect whether all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all` do not influence the output of this specific `print` statement because it is printing a hardcoded string.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is simply `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
