Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order up to the `n-1` elements. If `check_all` is `True`, then `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order up to the `n-1` elements. If `check_all` is `False`, then `a` is not guaranteed to be sorted in non-decreasing order up to the `n-1` elements.**
