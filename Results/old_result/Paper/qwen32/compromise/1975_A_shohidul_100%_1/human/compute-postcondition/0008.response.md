To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will iterate over the range starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1 because the range `range(1, n)` requires `n` to be at least 2 to include the value 1.

### Adjustments:
- Since `n` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.
- The variable `i` does not need to be explicitly set before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range` function in the loop head.

### Conclusion:
The state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 1. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `check_all`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is `False` indicating that `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order up to the `n-1` elements**.
