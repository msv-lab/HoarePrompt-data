Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is `False`; at the current index `i`, the element `a[i - 1]` is greater than the element `a[i]`; `new` is a list containing elements from `a[i:]`; either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False` (or both); `new_all` is `True` if `new[i - 1] <= new[i]` for all `i` in the range of 1 to `len(new)`, otherwise `False`.**
