The given initial state provides information about several variables and conditions in the program. Here's a breakdown:

- `t` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `check_all` is False because `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`.
- `_` is 1.
- `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index `i` to the end of `a`.
- `check_all_new` is True.
- `new_all` is True.
- All elements in `new` are non-decreasing.
- `a[0]` is greater than or equal to each element in `new`.

The print statement in the code is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This print statement does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state; it simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **YES**
