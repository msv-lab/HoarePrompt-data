The code snippet `new = a[i:]` creates a new list `new` that contains all elements of the list `a` starting from index `i` to the end of the list `a`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, or `_`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than or equal to 2
- `n` is greater than 1
- `a` is a list of integers
- `check_all` is False because `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`
- `_` is 1

After executing the code snippet, the only new variable introduced is `new`, which is a slice of `a` starting from index `i`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is False because `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `_` is 1, `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index `i` to the end of `a`.**
