Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is True if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order up to the `n-1` elements, otherwise False. The value of `check_all` remains unchanged regardless of whether the if or else part is executed.**
