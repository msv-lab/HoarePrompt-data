Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is `False`; at the current index `i`, the element `a[i - 1]` is greater than the element `a[i]`; `new` is a list containing elements from `a[i:]`. If both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False` (or both), and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
