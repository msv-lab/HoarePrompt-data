Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `n` is the new input integer.
- `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.
- `check_all` is True if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order up to the `n-1` elements, otherwise False.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'YES'`. There are no variables or conditions in the `print` statement itself that depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `check_all`. Therefore, regardless of the values of these variables, the output will always be `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
