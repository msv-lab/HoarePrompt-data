The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are modified by this code.

Output State: **`a` is a list of n positive integers where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and each element in `a` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read`; `idx` is 1; `t` is an integer obtained by converting the string at index 0 of `data` to an integer; `results` is an empty list.**
