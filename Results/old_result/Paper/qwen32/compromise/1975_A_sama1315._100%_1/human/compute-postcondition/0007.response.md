To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, we need to understand the operations performed within the loop and how they affect the variables.

The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the first integer read from the input. In each iteration:
1. It reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of elements in the next list `a`.
2. It then reads `n` integers from the input to form the list `a`.
3. It calls a function `func_1` with the list `a` as an argument and appends the result of this function call to the `results` list.
4. The index `idx` is updated to point to the next set of data for the next iteration.

After the loop completes, the variables `a`, `idx`, and `t` will have their values based on the last iteration of the loop, and `results` will contain the results of `func_1` for each list `a` processed in the loop.

Given that the initial state of `a`, `idx`, and `t` is provided, and `results` starts as an empty list, the final state can be described as follows:

- `a` will hold the last list of integers processed by the loop.
- `idx` will point to the position right after the last list of integers processed.
- `t` will remain unchanged as it is the total number of iterations.
- `results` will contain the results of `func_1` for each list `a` processed in the loop.

Since the exact values of `a` and `idx` depend on the input data, and the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, we cannot specify the exact values of `a` and the contents of `results`. However, we can describe the state in terms of how it will be after the loop completes.

Output State: **`a` is the last list of integers processed by the loop; `idx` is the position right after the last list of integers in the input; `t` is unchanged; `results` contains the results of `func_1` for each list `a` processed in the loop.**
