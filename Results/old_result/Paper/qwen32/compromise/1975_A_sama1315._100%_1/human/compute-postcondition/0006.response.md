The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the integer `t`. The loop will execute `t` times, so `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. The variables `a`, `data`, `idx`, and `results` are not part of the loop head and therefore should not be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`a` is a list of n positive integers where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and each element in `a` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.read`; `idx` is 1; `t` is an integer obtained by converting the string at index 0 of `data` to an integer and `t` must be greater than 0; `results` is an empty list.**
