### Reasoning:

The provided program and its annotations seem to follow a logical approach to solve the problem. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into two parts and the parts are swapped.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - If the array can be sorted by the described operation, there must be a rotation of the array that is sorted.
   - By concatenating the array with itself, we can easily check all possible rotations of the array.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - `func_1(a)`:
     - It calculates the length of the array `n`.
     - It creates a sorted version of the array `sorted_a`.
     - It creates a new array `concatenated_a` which is the original array `a` concatenated with itself.
     - It checks if any subarray of `concatenated_a` of length `n` (which corresponds to the original array `a` in some rotation) matches `sorted_a`.
     - If a match is found, it returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be sorted by the operation. Otherwise, it returns 'No'.
   
   - `func_2()`:
     - Reads input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

4. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations describe the state of the program at key points and confirm the logic of the implementation.

5. **Testing with Examples**:
   - The original assessment tested the program with the provided examples and found that the program correctly returned 'No' for the first test case, 'Yes' for the second test case, and 'Yes' for the third test case.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic and implementation seem correct based on the annotations and the testing with examples.

### Final Evaluation:

Based on the analysis and the annotations, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by the described operation for all test cases.

**Final: True**
