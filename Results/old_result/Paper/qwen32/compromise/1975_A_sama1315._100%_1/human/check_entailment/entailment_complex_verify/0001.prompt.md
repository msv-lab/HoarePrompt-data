You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_a = sorted(a)
    concatenated_a = a + a
    for i in range(n):
        if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:
            return 'Yes'
    return 'No'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        result = func_1(a)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of positive integers, and n is the length of the list a such that 2 <= n <= 50.
def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_a = sorted(a)
    concatenated_a = a + a
    for i in range(n):
        if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:
            return 'Yes'
        
    #State: None.
    return 'No'
    #The program returns 'No'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of positive integers, and it checks if any contiguous subsequence of length equal to the list itself in a doubled version of the list matches the sorted version of the list. The function always returns 'No'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n positive integers where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and each element in a satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        idx += 1
        
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        
        idx += n
        
        result = func_1(a)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: `a` is the last list of integers processed by the loop; `idx` is the position right after the last list of integers in the input; `t` is unchanged; `results` contains the results of `func_1` for each list `a` processed in the loop.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: result1\nresult2\n...\nresultN (where result1, result2, ..., resultN are the results of func_1 for each list a processed in the loop)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of a list of positive integers. For each list, it computes a result using the `func_1` function and then prints all results, one per line.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Breakdown:
- We have an array `a` of length `n`.
- We can perform an operation where we split the array into two parts `x` and `y` such that `a = x + y` and then swap `x` and `y` to get `a = y + x`.
- The task is to determine if we can sort the array in non-decreasing order using this operation any number of times.

### Solution Explanation:
The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a)`: This function checks if the array `a` can be sorted by performing the described operation.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

#### Analysis of `func_1(a)`:
- The function first calculates the length of the array `n`.
- It then creates a sorted version of the array `sorted_a`.
- It creates a new array `concatenated_a` which is the original array `a` concatenated with itself.
- The function then checks if any subarray of `concatenated_a` of length `n` (which corresponds to the original array `a` in some rotation) matches `sorted_a`.
- If a match is found, it returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be sorted by the operation. Otherwise, it returns 'No'.

#### Correctness of the Approach:
- The key insight is that if the array can be sorted by the described operation, then there must be a rotation of the array that is sorted.
- By concatenating the array with itself, we can easily check all possible rotations of the array.
- If any rotation matches the sorted version of the array, then it is possible to sort the array using the operation, and the function correctly returns 'Yes'.
- If no rotation matches the sorted version, the function correctly returns 'No'.

### Testing with the Example:
Let's test the example provided in the problem statement:
1. For the first test case (`[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`):
   - The sorted version is `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`.
   - Checking all rotations of the concatenated array, we find that none match the sorted version.
   - The function correctly returns 'No'.
2. For the second test case (`[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`):
   - The sorted version is `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`.
   - Checking all rotations, we find that the rotation `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]` matches the sorted version.
   - The function correctly returns 'Yes'.
3. For the third test case (`[1, 2, 3]`):
   - The sorted version is `[1, 2, 3]`.
   - The original array is already sorted, so it matches the sorted version.
   - The function correctly returns 'Yes'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by the described operation for all test cases.

Correctness: **True**
