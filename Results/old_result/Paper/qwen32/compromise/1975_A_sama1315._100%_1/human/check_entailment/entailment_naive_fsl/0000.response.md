Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. Let's analyze each function to determine if they meet the requirements of the problem description.

### Function `func_1(a)`:
This function checks if the array `a` can be rearranged into a non-decreasing order by performing the described operation (splitting the array into two parts and swapping them).

1. **Sorting the Array**: The function first creates a sorted version of the array `a` and stores it in `sorted_a`.
2. **Concatenating the Array**: The function then concatenates the array `a` with itself, resulting in `concatenated_a`.
3. **Checking Subarrays**: The function iterates through `concatenated_a` and checks if any subarray of length equal to `a` matches `sorted_a`. If a match is found, it means that the array can be rearranged into a non-decreasing order by performing the operation, and the function returns 'Yes'. If no match is found after checking all possible subarrays, it returns 'No'.

### Function `func_2()`:
This function handles the input and output for multiple test cases. It reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Analysis:
- The logic in `func_1` is correct. By concatenating the array with itself, it ensures that any possible rotation of the array is checked against the sorted version. If any rotation matches the sorted version, it confirms that the array can be rearranged into a non-decreasing order.
- The function handles multiple test cases correctly by reading the input and processing each test case independently.

### Testing with Provided Examples:
1. **First Test Case**: `a = [1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
   - Sorted version: `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`
   - Concatenated version: `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
   - No subarray of length 6 matches the sorted version, so the function returns 'No'.

2. **Second Test Case**: `a = [7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
   - Sorted version: `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`
   - Concatenated version: `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3, 7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
   - Subarray `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]` matches the sorted version, so the function returns 'Yes'.

3. **Third Test Case**: `a = [1, 2, 3]`
   - Sorted version: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Concatenated version: `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`
   - Subarray `[1, 2, 3]` matches the sorted version, so the function returns 'Yes'.

Since the program correctly handles all provided examples and the logic is sound, the correctness of the program is **True**.
