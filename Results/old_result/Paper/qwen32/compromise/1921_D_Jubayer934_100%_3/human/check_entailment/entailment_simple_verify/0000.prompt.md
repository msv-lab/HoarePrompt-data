You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

The variable `temp` is either -1 or an integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n. If `temp` is not -1, `ans` is a list containing the values `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes, and includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for all `i` in the range from `temp` to `n-1`. If `temp` is -1, `ans` contains the values `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes. The final output for each test case is the sum of the elements in `ans`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the total difference \( D \) for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for selecting elements from the array \( b \) to maximize the difference is flawed.

The program sorts the array \( a \) in ascending order and the array \( b \) in descending order. It then iterates through the elements of \( a \) and tries to match them with elements from \( b \) in a way that maximizes the absolute differences. However, the logic to decide whether to use the largest remaining element from \( b \) or the smallest remaining element from \( b \) is incorrect.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3 3
1 2 3
4 5 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
12
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- To maximize the difference, Vasya should choose \( b \) as \( [6, 5, 4] \).
- The differences would be \( |1-6| + |2-5| + |3-4| = 5 + 3 + 1 = 9 \).

However, the program may not always choose the optimal elements from \( b \). Let's see how the program would handle this input:

1. The program sorts \( a \) as \( [1, 2, 3] \) and \( b \) as \( [6, 5, 4] \).
2. It then iterates through \( a \) and calculates the differences:
   - For \( a[0] = 1 \), it compares \( |1-4| \) and \( |1-6| \) and chooses \( |1-6| = 5 \).
   - For \( a[1] = 2 \), it compares \( |2-5| \) and \( |2-6| \) and chooses \( |2-6| = 4 \).
   - For \( a[2] = 3 \), it compares \( |3-4| \) and \( |3-6| \) and chooses \( |3-6| = 3 \).

The sum of these differences is \( 5 + 4 + 3 = 12 \), which is correct in this case, but the logic is not robust enough to handle all cases correctly.

A more robust approach would involve sorting \( a \) and \( b \) and then greedily choosing the largest possible difference for each element in \( a \) by comparing the smallest and largest available elements in \( b \).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        ans = 0
        i, j = 0, m - 1
        for k in range(n):
            if i <= j:
                if abs(a[k] - b[i]) > abs(a[k] - b[j]):
                    ans += abs(a[k] - b[i])
                    i += 1
                else:
                    ans += abs(a[k] - b[j])
                    j -= 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that for each element in \( a \), the element in \( b \) that maximizes the difference is chosen, either from the smallest or largest available elements in \( b \).
