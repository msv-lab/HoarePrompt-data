Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is -1; `ans` is an empty list; `a` is the list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is the list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` will have reached `n` after the loop completes.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
        temp = i
        break
    ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is 0 if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and the element at the position `n - i` from the end of `b` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and the element at position `i` in `b`; otherwise, `temp` remains -1, `ans` is a list containing one element `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `a` is the list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is the list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, and `i` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `ans` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, and the second element is `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, `a` is the list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is the list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, `i` is 1, and `temp` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `ans` is a list containing three elements: the first element is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, the second element is `abs(a[1] - b[1])` if `abs(a[1] - b[-(n - 1)]) <= abs(a[1] - b[1])` or `abs(a[1] - b[-(n - 1)])` if `abs(a[1] - b[-(n - 1)]) > abs(a[1] - b[1])` and `temp` is set to 2, and the third element is `abs(a[2] - b[2])`, `a` is the list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is the list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, and `i` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
