The code snippet provided assigns the value of `i` to `temp`. Therefore, the value of `temp` will now be equal to the value of `i`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `temp` is `i`; `ans` is a list containing the value `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and the newly appended value `abs(a[i] - b[i])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` is `i + 1`**.

In natural language, this means that the variable `temp` now holds the value of `i`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
