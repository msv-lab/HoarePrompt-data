Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is 1, `ans` is a list containing one element `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `a` is the list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is the list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, and `i` is 1; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables. It only causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is placed within. Therefore, all variables retain their initial values.
