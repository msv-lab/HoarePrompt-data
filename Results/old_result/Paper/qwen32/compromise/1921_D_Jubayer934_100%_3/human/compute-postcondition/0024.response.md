The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `temp`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to ensure that the loop can execute.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n` and `i` starts from `temp`.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: Since `i` starts from `temp`, `temp` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute.
3. **Current Value of `temp`**: The problem states that the current value of `temp` is not -1. However, it doesn’t specify the exact value of `temp`. For the loop to execute, `temp` must be a valid index, i.e., `0 ≤ temp < n`.

Given these points, the state should be adjusted so that `temp` is a valid starting index for the loop and is less than `n`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `temp` is an integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n; `ans` is a list containing the values `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.**
