You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5. a_i is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. b_i is a list of m integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        temp = -1
        
        ans = []
        
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]
        
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]
        
        for i in range(n):
            if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
                temp = i
                break
            ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))
        
        if temp != -1:
            for i in range(temp, n):
                ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))
        
        print(sum(ans))
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each of the `t` test cases, the following holds: `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer such that `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, and `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order. The variable `temp` is either -1 or an integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n. If `temp` is not -1, `ans` is a list containing the values `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes, and includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for all `i` in the range from `temp` to `n-1`. If `temp` is -1, `ans` contains the values `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes. The final output for each test case is the sum of the elements in `ans`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a list `b` of `m` integers. It returns a result based on the provided lists for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
