Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer representing the current time step, `player` is a dictionary where the position of player `p` is `[-1, -1]`, the position of other players remains unchanged, `blud` is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field, `out` is a list containing the player identifier `p`, and `p` is the next player key in the `player` dictionary after the current `p`.**

In simpler terms, the position of player `p` in the `player` dictionary is updated to `[-1, -1]`, while the positions of other players and the values of `t`, `blud`, `out`, and `p` remain unchanged.
