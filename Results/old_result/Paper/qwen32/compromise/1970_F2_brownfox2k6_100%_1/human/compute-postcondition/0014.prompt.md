Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a non-negative integer representing the current time step, `player` is a dictionary where keys are player identifiers and values are their positions on the field (as lists of two integers), `blud` is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field, and `out` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for p in player:
    if player[p] == blud:
        out.append(p)
        player[p] = [-1, -1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a non-negative integer representing the current time step, `player` is a dictionary where the position of player `p` is `[-1, -1]` if `player[p]` was equal to `blud`, otherwise the position of player `p` remains unchanged and other players' positions remain the same, `blud` is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field, and `out` is a list containing the player identifier `p` if `player[p]` was equal to `blud`, otherwise `out` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a non-negative integer representing the current time step. If `player[p]` was equal to `blud`, then the position of player `p` is set to `[-1, -1]`, the position of other players remains unchanged, `blud` is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field, and `out` is a list containing the player identifier `p`. If `player[p]` was not equal to `blud`, then the position of player `p` and other players remains unchanged, `blud` remains a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field, and `out` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `p` is the next player identifier in the `player` list. If `player[p]` was equal to `blud`, then `p` is appended to `out` and `player[p]` is set to `[-1, -1]`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `out` or `player[p]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
