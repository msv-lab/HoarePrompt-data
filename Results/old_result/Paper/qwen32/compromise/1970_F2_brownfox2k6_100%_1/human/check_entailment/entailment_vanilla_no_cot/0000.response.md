Correctness: **False**

The provided code snippet does not cover the full logic required to solve the problem. Here are some issues and missing parts:

1. **Initialization**: The code does not initialize the field, players, goals, Quaffle, and Bludger positions. It does not parse the input to set up the game state.

2. **Game Logic**: The code does not handle the game logic, such as catching and throwing the Quaffle, scoring goals, and moving entities.

3. **Output**: The code does not generate the required output, which includes printing events of goals and eliminations, and the final score.

4. **Function `func_2`**: This function is supposed to handle the elimination of players due to the Bludger, but it does not correctly manage the positions of players and the Bludger. It also does not handle the case where multiple players might be eliminated at the same time.

5. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly handles the movement of entities, but it is not integrated into the rest of the game logic.

To make the program correct, you would need to implement the full game logic, including parsing the input, handling each action, and generating the required output. Here is a high-level outline of what the program should do:

1. Parse the input to initialize the game field, player positions, goal positions, Quaffle position, and Bludger position.
2. For each action, update the positions of entities and handle the specific action (move, catch, throw).
3. Check for goal scoring and player elimination after each action.
4. Print the events (goals and eliminations) in the correct order.
5. After processing all actions, print the final score.

Since the provided code does not implement these steps, it is incorrect.
