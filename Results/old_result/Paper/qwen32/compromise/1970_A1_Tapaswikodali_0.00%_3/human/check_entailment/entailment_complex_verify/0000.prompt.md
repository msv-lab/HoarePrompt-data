You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
def func():
    s = input()
    balance = 0
    details = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        details.append((balance, -i, char))
    details.sort()
    result = ''.join((char for (_, _, char) in details))
    print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func():
    s = input()
    balance = 0
    details = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
        details.append((balance, -i, char))
        
    #State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `balance` is 0; `details` is a list of tuples (balance, -i, char) for each character in the string `s`.
    details.sort()
    result = ''.join(char for _, _, char in details)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: s (where s is the balanced parentheses string)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a non-empty string `s` consisting of balanced parentheses and prints a rearranged version of the string based on the balance and position of each parenthesis.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Here’s a breakdown of how the code works and why it should be considered correct for all valid inputs:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads a balanced parentheses sequence `s` from standard input.

2. **Balance Calculation**:
   - It initializes a `balance` variable to 0.
   - It iterates over the string `s` using `enumerate`, which provides both the index `i` and the character `char` at that index.
   - For each character, it updates the `balance`:
     - If the character is `'('`, it increments the `balance` by 1.
     - If the character is `')'`, it decrements the `balance` by 1.
   - It stores a tuple `(balance, -i, char)` in the `details` list. The `-i` ensures that in case of ties in the `balance`, the positions are sorted in decreasing order, as required by the problem.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The `details` list is sorted. This sort will first sort by `balance` in increasing order, and for ties in `balance`, it will sort by `-i` in increasing order, which corresponds to sorting by `i` in decreasing order.

4. **Result Construction**:
   - It constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `details` list, ignoring the `balance` and position values.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the resulting balanced shuffle sequence.

By following these steps, the program ensures that the resulting sequence is a balanced shuffle of the input sequence. It correctly handles the sorting criteria and constructs the output sequence as specified in the problem statement. Since the problem guarantees that the input is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence, the program does not need to handle invalid inputs.

Given the above analysis, there is no apparent case where this program would fail to produce the correct balanced shuffle for a valid input. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases within the given constraints.
