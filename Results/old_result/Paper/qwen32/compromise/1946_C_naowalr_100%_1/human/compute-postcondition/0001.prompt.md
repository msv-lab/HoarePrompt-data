Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func_1` does not take any parameters. It reads input from standard input, which includes multiple sets of input data. Each set starts with two integers `n` and `k` where `1 <= k < n <= 10^5`, representing the number of vertices and the number of edges to be removed, respectively. This is followed by `n-1` lines, each containing two integers `v` and `u` (1 <= v, u <= n) representing an edge between vertices `v` and `u`. The function processes each set of input data to determine the maximum number `x` such that removing exactly `k` edges results in all remaining connected components having at least `x` vertices.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
    solve()


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
