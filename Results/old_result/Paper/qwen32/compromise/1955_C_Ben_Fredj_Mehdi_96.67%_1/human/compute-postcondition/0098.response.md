Postcondition: **`t` remains unchanged. `n` and `k` retain their initial values. `k % 2 == 1`. `a` is modified such that the first `k // 2` non-zero elements from the start and the first `k // 2` non-zero elements from the end are each decremented by 1. `g` points to the next non-zero element after the last decrement from the start. `d` points to the next non-zero element after the last decrement from the end.**
