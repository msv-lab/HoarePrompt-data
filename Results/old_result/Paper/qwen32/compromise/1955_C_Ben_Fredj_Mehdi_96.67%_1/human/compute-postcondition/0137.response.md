The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'200'`. The initial state describes variables `t`, `a`, and `z`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value of `t`, `a`, and `z` does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Let's break down the given information:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input.
- `z` is incremented by 1 (`z = z + 1`).

Since the `print` statement is `print('200')`, it will print the string `'200'` regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, and `z`.

Output: **200**
