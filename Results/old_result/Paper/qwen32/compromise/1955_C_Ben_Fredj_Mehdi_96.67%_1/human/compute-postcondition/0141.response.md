The `print('10')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string `'10'`. The values of the variables `t`, `a`, and `z` do not affect the output of this particular print statement because the string to be printed is explicitly provided.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `t` is an integer input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
2. The variable `a` is a list of integers obtained from new input.
3. The variable `z` is incremented by 1 (`z = z + 1`).

None of these variables are used in the `print('10')` statement. The statement directly prints the string `'10'`.

Output: **10**
