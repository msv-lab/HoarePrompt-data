Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers where the first element is `a[0] - 1` and the last element is `a[d] - 1` if `a[d]` is not 0, otherwise `a[d]` is 0; `n` and `k` retain their initial values; `k` is not equal to 1999999998, `k` is not equal to 1999999999, `k` is not equal to 99999999999; either `n` is not equal to 1, or `k` is not equal to 10000000000000, or the first element of `a` is not 1; `k` is not equal to 9999999999; it is not the case that `n` is equal to 101 and `k` is equal to 100000000000; `k` is not equal to 10000000000000; `k` is not equal to 99999999999999; `k` is not equal to 199999999999999; `k` is not equal to 1000000000000; and `k` is not equal to 200000000000; either `k` is not equal to 2147483648 or `n` is not equal to 2; it is not the case that `n` is equal to 2 and `k` is equal to 1000000000 and `a` is equal to [1000000000, 1000000000]; it is not the case that `n` is equal to 5 and `k` is equal to 2147483648; it is not the case that `n` is equal to 20 and `k` is equal to 10000000000; `k` is not equal to 5999999999; `k` is not equal to 4294967295; it is not the case that `n` is equal to 2 and `k` is equal to `a[0] - 1` and `k` is equal to `a[1] - 2`; `k` is not equal to 3000000000`; `k` is less than the sum of the elements in `a`; `d` is equal to `len(a) - 1` if `a[d]` is not 0, otherwise `d` is equal to `len(a) - 2`; `g` is 0 if `a[g]` (which is `a[0]`) is not 0, otherwise `g` is 1; `k` is greater than 1; the current value of `a[g]` is unchanged.**
