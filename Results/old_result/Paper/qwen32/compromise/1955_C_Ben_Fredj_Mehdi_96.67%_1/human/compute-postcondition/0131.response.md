The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'9'`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, or `z` mentioned in the initial state. The value to be printed is explicitly given as the string `'9'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes the variables `t`, `a`, and `z`, but none of these are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is `print('9')`, which directly outputs the string `'9'`.

Therefore, the output will be the string `'9'`.

Output: **9**
