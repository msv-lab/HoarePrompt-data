Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input line with the first element decremented by 2, the last element decremented by 1, and the element at index `d` further decremented by 1, `z` is incremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the start up to the first space, `k` is at least 2, `d` is `len(a) - 2` if the last element of `a` is 0, otherwise `d` is `len(a) - 1`, `g` is 1 if the first element of `a` was 0 and 2 otherwise, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
