The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'0'`. This print statement is independent of the variables `t`, `a`, `n`, and `k` described in the initial state. The value `'0'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement and does not depend on any calculations or conditions based on the input variables.

Therefore, the output will be the string `'0'`.

Output: **0**
