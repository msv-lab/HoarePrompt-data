Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from new input.
   - `z` is `z + 1`. However, the variable `z` is not defined or used anywhere in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the print statement.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('0')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement explicitly prints the string `'0'`.
   - The value of `t`, `a`, and `z` do not influence the print statement because the print statement is hardcoded to output `'0'`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The output of the print statement is simply the string `'0'`.

Output: **0**
