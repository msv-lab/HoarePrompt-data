The initial state provides us with several conditions and values for the variables `t`, `a`, `n`, and `k`. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of these variables. It simply prints the string `'2'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), but it is not used in the print statement.
2. The variable `a` is a list of integers derived from an input string, but it is also not used in the print statement.
3. The variables `n` and `k` are mentioned to retain their initial values, and specific conditions are given for `k` and `n`, but these conditions do not affect the print statement.
4. The print statement is `print('2')`, which directly outputs the string `'2'`.

Since the print statement is not influenced by the values of `t`, `a`, `n`, or `k`, the output is simply the string `'2'`.

Output: **2**
