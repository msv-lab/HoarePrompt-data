Let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input line.
3. `z` is incremented by 1 (though `z` is not used in the print statement).
4. `n` is the integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the start up to the first space.
5. `k` is the integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the first space + 1 to the end of the string.

### Code to Execute:
```python
print('10000')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'10000'`.
- The values of `t`, `a`, `z`, `n`, and `k` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it is printing a hardcoded string.

### Conclusion:
Since the `print` statement is outputting a hardcoded string `'10000'`, the output will be exactly that string.

Output: **10000**
