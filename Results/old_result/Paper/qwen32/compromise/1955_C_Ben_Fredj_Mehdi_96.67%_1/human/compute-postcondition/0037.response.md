The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'200'`. The initial state provides a detailed description of several variables (`t`, `a`, `n`, `k`), but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'200'`, regardless of the values of the other variables.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('200')`.
2. This statement outputs the string `'200'` directly.
3. The value of `'200'` is a literal string and does not depend on any variable or condition provided in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is the string `'200'`.

Output: **200**
