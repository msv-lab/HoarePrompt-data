To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head and its dependencies.

The for loop is:
```python
for i in range(k // 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `k // 2` is greater than 0. This means `k` must be at least 2 because `k // 2` will be 0 if `k` is 0 or 1.

From the problem statement, we know:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4 (this does not affect the loop execution directly).
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input line.
- `z` is incremented by 1 (this does not affect the loop execution directly).
- `n` is the integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the start up to the first space.
- `k` is the integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the first space + 1 to the end of the string.
- `d` is `len(a) - 1` (this does not affect the loop execution directly).
- `g` is 0 (this does not affect the loop execution directly).

The only variable in the loop head is `i`, but `i` is controlled by the range function, which is determined by `k // 2`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `k` is at least 2.

So, the state needs to be adjusted such that `k` is at least 2.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input line, `z` is incremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the start up to the first space, `k` is at least 2, `d` is `len(a) - 1`, `g` is 0**
