Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers. If `k` equals 3000000000, `z` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `k` is not 3000000000, `z` is incremented by 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of `a`. If `k` is less than the sum of `a`, the first `k // 2` and last `k // 2` elements of `a` are decremented by 1, and if `k` is odd, the first non-zero element `a[g]` is also decremented by 1, with `z` incremented by `k // 2`.**
