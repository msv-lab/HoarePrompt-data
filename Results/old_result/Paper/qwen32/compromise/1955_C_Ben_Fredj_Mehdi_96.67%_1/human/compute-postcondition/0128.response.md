Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
  - `a` is a list of integers obtained from a new input.
  - `z` is `z + 1`. However, the initial value of `z` is not given, and it seems that `z` is not used in the provided print statement.

- **Code to Execute:**
  ```python
  print('1')
  ```

The `print` statement is printing the string `'1'`. It does not depend on the values of `t`, `a`, or `z`. The string `'1'` is explicitly provided and will be printed as is.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **1**
