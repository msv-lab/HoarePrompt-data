The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'2'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, and `z`), but the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables. Instead, it simply prints the string `'2'`.

Let's break it down:
- `t` is an integer input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from new input.
- `z` is incremented by 1 (i.e., `z = z + 1`).

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the string provided in the statement itself.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **2**
