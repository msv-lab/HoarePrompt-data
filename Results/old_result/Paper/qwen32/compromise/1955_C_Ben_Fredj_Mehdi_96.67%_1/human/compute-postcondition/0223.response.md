Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, we need to determine what will be printed when the `print('5')` statement is executed. Let's break down the information provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is a list of integers derived from a new input line.
- `z` is incremented by 1.
- `n` is the integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the start up to the first space.
- `k` is the integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the first space + 1 to the end of the string.

However, the `print('5')` statement does not use any of the variables `t`, `a`, `z`, `n`, or `k`. It simply prints the string `'5'`.

Therefore, the output will be the string `'5'`.

Output: **5**
