The code snippet provided modifies the value of the element in the list `a` at the index `g` by subtracting 1 from its integer value. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 1`**

This means that the value at index `g` in the list `a` has been decremented by 1, and `i` retains its initial state of `i + 1`.
