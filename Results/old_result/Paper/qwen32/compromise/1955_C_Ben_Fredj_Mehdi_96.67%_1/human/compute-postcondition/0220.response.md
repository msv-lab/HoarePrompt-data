Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: This is an input integer, and we know it satisfies the condition \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). However, its exact value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
2. **`a`**: This is a list of integers derived from the new input line. The exact contents of this list are not specified, but it is mentioned that it contains integers.
3. **`z`**: This variable is incremented by 1. However, its value is not used in the print statement, so it doesn't affect the output.
4. **`n`**: This is the integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the start up to the first space. The exact value of `n` is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
5. **`k`**: This is the integer value of the substring of the previous `a` from the first space + 1 to the end of the string. The exact value of `k` is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('0')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly prints the string `'0'`. None of the variables `t`, `a`, `z`, `n`, or `k` are used in this print statement. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'0'`.

### Output:
Output: **0**
