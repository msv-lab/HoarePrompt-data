Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input.
- `z` is `z + 1`.

The print statement:
```python
print('1')
```

The print statement directly prints the string `'1'`, regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, or `z`. The variables `t`, `a`, and `z` are not used in the print statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Output: **1**
