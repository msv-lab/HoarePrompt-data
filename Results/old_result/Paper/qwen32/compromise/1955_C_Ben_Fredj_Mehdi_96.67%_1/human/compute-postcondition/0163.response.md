Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers where the first element `a[g]` has been decreased by 1, `a[d]` has been decreased by 1, `z` is `z + 1`, `d` is `len(a) - 1` if `a[d]` is not 0 after the decrement, otherwise `d` is `len(a) - 2`, `k` is at least 2, and `g` is incremented by 1 if `a[g]` becomes 0, `i` is `i + 1`, and `g` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `g` is incremented by 1 as specified in the code snippet. All other variables remain unchanged.
