#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    #State: The final output state is the concatenation of the printed results from each of the `t` iterations. Each iteration's result is printed based on the specific conditions of `n`, `k`, and `a` for that iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it prints a specific value based on predefined conditions involving `n`, `k`, and the elements of `a`. The final output is the concatenation of the printed results for each test case.
