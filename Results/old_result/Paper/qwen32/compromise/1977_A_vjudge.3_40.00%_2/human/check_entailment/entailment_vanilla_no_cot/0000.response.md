Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

The problem states that Nikita can make `n` moves where each move can either add one cube to the tower or remove one cube from the tower. The goal is to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

The logic in the provided program can be summarized as follows:
1. If `n == m`, print "Yes" because the number of moves equals the number of cubes, implying that all moves can be additions.
2. If `m > n`, print "No" because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves since each move can only add or remove one cube.
3. If `m == n - 1`, print "Yes" because one move can be a removal and the rest additions.
4. If both `m` and `n` are even, print "Yes".
5. If both `m` and `n` are odd, print "Yes".
6. Otherwise, print "No".

However, the logic in points 4 and 5 is not correct. The key observation for this problem is that the difference `n - m` must be even. This is because each addition or removal changes the number of cubes by 1, so after `n` moves, the final number of cubes `m` can only be reached if `n - m` is even (because an even number of moves can balance out to any even difference).

Here's a corrected version of the logic:
- If `n - m` is even, print "Yes".
- Otherwise, print "No".

Let's check the provided test cases with the corrected logic:
- For `n = 3` and `m = 3`, `n - m = 0` (even), so the answer is "Yes".
- For `n = 2` and `m = 4`, `n - m = -2` (even), but since `m > n`, the answer is "No".
- For `n = 5` and `m = 3`, `n - m = 2` (even), so the answer is "Yes".

The given program does not correctly implement this logic, especially the checks for even and odd numbers independently. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
