The function `func` accepts an integer `t` where 1 <= t <= 100. For each of the following `t` lines, it receives two integers `n` and `m` where 1 <= n, m <= 100. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the provided values of `n` and `m` for each pair.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and `t` pairs of integers (`n`, `m`). For each pair, it returns a result based on the values of `n` and `m`.**
