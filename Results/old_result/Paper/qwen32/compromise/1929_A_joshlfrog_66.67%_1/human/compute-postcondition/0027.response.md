The code snippet provided overwrites the existing `nums` list with a new list of integers obtained from the user input. Other variables (`t`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `e`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `l` is the integer value provided by the user input; `nums` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `x` is the maximum value found in the new `nums`; `y` is the minimum value found in the new `nums`; `e` is `e + 1`.**
