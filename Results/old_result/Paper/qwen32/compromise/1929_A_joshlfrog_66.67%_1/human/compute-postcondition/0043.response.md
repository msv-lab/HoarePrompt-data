Given the initial state, `i` is `i + 1`, which implies that `i` has already been incremented by 1 before the code snippet is executed. The code snippet `x = nums[i]` assigns the value at index `i` of the list `nums` to the variable `x`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `x` is `nums[i + 1]`**.

In natural language: The value of `i` remains `i + 1` after the code execution, and `x` is assigned the value from the list `nums` at the index `i + 1`.
