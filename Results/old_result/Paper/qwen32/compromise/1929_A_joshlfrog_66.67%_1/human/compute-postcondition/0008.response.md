The code `x = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `x`. Given that the initial state specifies that `nums[i]` is greater than `x` (which is 0 initially), after the execution of the code, `x` will take the value of `nums[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `l` is greater than or equal to 1; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `x` is `nums[i]`; `y` is 100000000; `i` is 0; the current value of `nums[i]` is greater than `x`.**
