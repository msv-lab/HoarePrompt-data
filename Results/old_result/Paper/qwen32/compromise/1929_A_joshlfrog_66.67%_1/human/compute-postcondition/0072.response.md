To determine what will be printed by the `print(x - y)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500. This variable `t` is not directly used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for this specific task.
- `l` is an integer value provided by the user input. This value is used to update `e` (i.e., `e = e + l`), but `e` is not used in the `print` statement, so we can also ignore it for this specific task.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from new user input.
- `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`.
- `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`.

The `print(x - y)` statement will output the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `nums`.

Since the exact values of the list `nums` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `x - y`. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **x - y (where x is the maximum value in the list `nums` and y is the minimum value in the list `nums`)**
