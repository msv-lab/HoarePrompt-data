Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the length of an array, followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the elements of the array.**
