The code snippet `y = nums[i]` updates the value of `y` to the value of `nums[i]`. The other variables (`t`, `l`, `nums`, `e`, `x`, and `i`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `l` is greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of integers, `e` is `e + 1`, `x` is `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is greater than the previous `x`, otherwise `x` remains unchanged, `y` is `nums[i]`, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
