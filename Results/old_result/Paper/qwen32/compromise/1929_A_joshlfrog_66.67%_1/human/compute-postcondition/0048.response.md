To determine the output, let's break down the given information:

1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500. However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet.
2. `l` is the integer value provided by the user input, indicating the number of elements in the list `nums`.
3. `nums` is the list of integers obtained from the input.
4. `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`.
5. `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`.
6. `e` is `e + 1`. However, `e` is not used in the provided code snippet.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(x - y)
```

This statement prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `nums`.

Since the exact values of `nums` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `x - y`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `nums`.

Output: **x - y (where x is the maximum value in the list `nums` and y is the minimum value in the list `nums`)**
