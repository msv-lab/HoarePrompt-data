The code snippet `l = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `l`. This means the value of `l` will be updated to whatever integer the user provides. The values of `t`, `nums`, `x`, `y`, and `e` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `l` is the integer value provided by the user input, `nums` is the list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is the maximum value in `nums`, `y` is the minimum value in `nums`, and `e` is `e + 1`.**
