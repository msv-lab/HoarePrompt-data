The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a length `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. For each test case, it computes and prints a modified binary string `s` and an integer `t`. The string `s` is derived based on specific conditions involving the two input strings, and `t` is determined by comparing a substring of the second input string with part of `s`.
