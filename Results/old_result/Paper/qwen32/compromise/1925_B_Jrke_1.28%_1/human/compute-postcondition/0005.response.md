The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, in the provided code snippet, there is no loop, so the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the program flow or the variables. Therefore, none of the variables `t`, `x`, `n`, or `k` are affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer provided by the input, `n` is the second integer provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, and the current value of `k` is 1.**
