Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 4, `n` is the second integer provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, and `i` is incremented by 2 from its value at the end of the previous iteration and is still less than `int(x)`. If `x % i == 0`, then if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` contains the values of `ans`, `i`, and the new value `x // i`. Otherwise, `l` contains the value of `ans` and the new value `x // i`. The value of `ans` has been updated to the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x % i != 0`, no changes are made to `l` or `ans`.**
