Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 4, `n` is the second integer provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is the next odd number after the previous `i` in the range `[1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x)`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` contains the values `ans` and `i` and `x // i`. Otherwise, `l` contains the values `ans` and `x // i`.**
