The given code snippet only appends the value of `ans` to the list `l`. No other variables are modified or used in the computation. Therefore, the only change in the state is the list `l` which now contains the value of `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 4, `n` is the second integer provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is the next odd number after the previous `i` in the range `[1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x)`, `l` is a list containing the value `ans`.**
