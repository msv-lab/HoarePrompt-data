Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 4, `n` is the second integer provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, and `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x % i == 0`, then `i` divides `x` evenly. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` contains the values [1, i, x // i]. Otherwise, `l` remains [1, i]. If `x % i != 0`, `l` remains unchanged.**
