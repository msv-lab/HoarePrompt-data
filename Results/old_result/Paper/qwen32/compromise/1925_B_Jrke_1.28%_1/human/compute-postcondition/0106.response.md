Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 36, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in `l`, and `i` remains 7. If `x % 7 == 0`, then if `x // 7` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing `ans` and 7, plus `x // 7`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing only `ans`. If `x % 7 != 0`, `l` remains unchanged.**
