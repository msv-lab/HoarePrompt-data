Output State: **After all iterations, for each test case provided by the input, the output is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, where `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`.**

In simpler terms, for each pair of integers `x` and `n` provided in the input, the program calculates and prints the largest divisor of `x` that is not greater than `x // n`. This process is repeated for all test cases specified by the initial integer `t`.
