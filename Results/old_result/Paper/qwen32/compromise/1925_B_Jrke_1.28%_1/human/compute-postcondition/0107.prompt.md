Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer provided by the input, `n` is the second integer provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is `x // n`, and `ans` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
    if x % i == 0:
        l = [ans]
        if i <= k:
            l.append(i)
        if x // i <= k:
            l.append(x // i)
        ans = max(l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is x // n, `ans` is the maximum value in `l`. If `x % i == 0`, then `l` is [1] if `i > k`, and `l` is [1, i] if `i <= k`, and `l` includes `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k` and `x` is divisible by `i`. Otherwise, `l` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is x // n, `ans` is the maximum value in `l`, and `i` is 5. If `x % 5 == 0`, then `l` is updated to `[ans, 5, x // 5]` if `x // 5` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is updated to `[ans, x // 5]`. If `x % 5 != 0`, `l` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 36, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in `l`, and `i` remains 7. If `x % 7 == 0`, then if `x // 7` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing `ans` and 7, plus `x // 7`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing only `ans`. If `x % 7 != 0`, `l` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
