Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `x` is at least 4; `n` is the second integer provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= x; `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`; `ans` is 1; `i` is the next odd number after the previous `i` in the range `[1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x)]`. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is updated to include `x // i`, making `l` equal to `[1, i, x // i]` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, or `[1, x // i]` if `i` is greater than `k`. Otherwise, `l` remains `[1]`.**
