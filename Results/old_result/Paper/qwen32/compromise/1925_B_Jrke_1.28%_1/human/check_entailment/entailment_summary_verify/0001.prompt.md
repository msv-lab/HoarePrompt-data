You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        k = x // n
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
For each of the `t` test cases, the function takes two integers `x` and `n` as input, with `1 <= n <= x` and `1 <= x <= 10^8`. It calculates the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the integer division of `x` by `n` and prints this value for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to divide a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems with positive integer difficulties such that their sum equals `x`. The goal is to maximize the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of these sub-problems' difficulties.

### Solution Strategy:
To maximize the GCD, the optimal strategy is to find the largest divisor `d` of `x` such that `x/d <= n`. This is because:
- If `x/d <= n`, then we can divide the problem into `x/d` sub-problems each of difficulty `d`, and possibly some extra sub-problems of difficulty 1 (if `x % d != 0`).
- The GCD of these difficulties will be `d`, which is maximized when `d` is the largest possible divisor satisfying the condition.

### Program Analysis:
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it follows this strategy:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.

2. **Handling Special Case `k == 1`:**
   - If `k = x // n == 1`, it means that `x` is less than `n`, and the only possible way to divide `x` into `n` sub-problems is to have `n - x` sub-problems with difficulty 1 and `x` sub-problems with difficulty 1. Hence, the GCD is 1.

3. **Finding the Largest Possible GCD:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to 1.
   - It then iterates over odd divisors of `x` starting from 1 (or 2 if `x` is even) up to `sqrt(x)`.
   - For each divisor `i`:
     - If `i` is a divisor of `x` and `i <= k`, it considers `i` as a candidate for `ans`.
     - If `x // i` is a divisor of `x` and `x // i <= k`, it considers `x // i` as a candidate for `ans`.
     - It updates `ans` to be the maximum of the current `ans` and the candidates.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum `ans` found for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the special case where `x // n == 1`.
- The program iterates over all possible divisors of `x` to find the largest one that can be the GCD of the sub-problems.
- The iteration only goes up to `sqrt(x)`, which is efficient given the constraints (`x <= 10^8`).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy to find the maximum balance (GCD) of the sub-problems' difficulties. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
