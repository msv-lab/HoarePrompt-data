To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is at least 0.
2. `n` must be greater than 0.
3. `mak2` is the final value of `mak`.
4. `pans` is an empty list.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Analysis:
- `mak` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, `mak2` is described as the final value of `mak`, which implies that `mak` must have been defined and updated somewhere in the code (not shown here).
- `mak2` is the final value of `mak`.
- `i` is not defined in the initial state. Its value is not provided, so we can't determine its exact value. However, we can assume that `i` is a variable that has been defined and used in the code execution.
- `mak2` is printed twice in the statement.

Since the exact values of `mak` and `i` are not provided, we can only describe them based on the given information.

### Output:
The print statement will output a question mark, the value of `mak`, the final value of `mak` (which is `mak2`), the value of `i`, and the final value of `mak` again.

Output: **? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] (where mak is the value of mak, mak2 is the final value of mak, and i is the value of i)**
