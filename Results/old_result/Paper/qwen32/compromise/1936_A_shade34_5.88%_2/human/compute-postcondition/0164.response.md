The value of `mak` is updated to the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is equal to the previous value of `mak`, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input string `s` was `=` or the last index `i` for which `s` was `<`, `i` is the last processed index + 2, and `mak` is equal to `i`.
