`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`t`, `mak2`, `pans`, `mak`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `mak2` is equal to the final value of `mak`, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input string `s` was `=` or the last index `i` for which `s` was `<`, `mak` is the index of the largest element in `pans` for which the comparison resulted in `'>'`.**
