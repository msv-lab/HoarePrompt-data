Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func()` does not take any input arguments directly. Instead, it interacts with the judge through input and output operations. The interaction starts with reading the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3). For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of the secret permutation `p`. The function can then perform up to 3n queries of the form "? a b c d" (0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n) to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in `p`. After determining the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized, the function outputs "! i j". The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '<':
            mak = i
    mak2 = mak
    pans = []
    for i in range(n):
        print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        s = str(input())
        if s == '<':
            mak = i
            pans = [i]
        elif s == '=':
            pans.append(i)
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, len(pans)):
        print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '>':
            mak = i
    print('!', mak2, mak)
    sys.stdout.flush()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t (number of test cases) is at least 1; n is unchanged; mak2 is 0; pans is a list of all indices i for which the input was '='; mak is the index of the last element in pans for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such element exists.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is equal to the final value of `mak`, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input string `s` was `=` or the last index `i` for which `s` was `<`. `mak` is the index of the largest element in `pans` for which the comparison resulted in `'>'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is the final value of `mak` before the loop, `mak` is the last index `i` for which the input was `'>'` (or 0 if no input was `'>'`), and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `'='` and must have at least 2 elements.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
