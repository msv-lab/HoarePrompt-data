The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i` which is `i + 1`.

The value of `t`, `mak`, and the current input string do not affect the loop condition directly, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`**
