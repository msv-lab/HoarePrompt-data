The code snippet provided initializes a variable `mak` to 0. The initial state specifies that `t` (number of test cases) must be at least 1 and `n` is an input integer. The value of `n` is not changed by the code snippet, and `t` remains at least 1. The only change is the introduction of `mak` with a value of 0.

Output State: **`t` (number of test cases) must be at least 1; `n` is an input integer; `mak` is 0.**
