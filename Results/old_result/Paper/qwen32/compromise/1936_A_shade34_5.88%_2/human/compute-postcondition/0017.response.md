Output State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `mak` is `i + 1`**

Natural Language: The number of test cases `t` remains at least 1. The value of `n` is still greater than `i + 1`. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The new variable `mak` is assigned the value of the incremented `i`.
