The code snippet `pans = [i]` assigns a new list containing the value of `i` to the variable `pans`. The previous value of `pans` (which was an empty list) is overwritten. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, `s`, and `mak`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the final value of `mak`, `pans` is a list containing `[i]`, `s` is the input string and `s` equals '<', `mak` is the value of `i`.**
