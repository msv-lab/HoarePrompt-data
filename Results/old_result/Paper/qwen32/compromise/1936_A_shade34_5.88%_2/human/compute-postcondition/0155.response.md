Postcondition: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is equal to the final value of `mak`, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input string `s` was `=` or the last index `i` for which `s` was `<`. If the current input string `s` is `<`, then `mak` is set to the current index `i`. Otherwise, `mak` retains its initial value of 0.**
