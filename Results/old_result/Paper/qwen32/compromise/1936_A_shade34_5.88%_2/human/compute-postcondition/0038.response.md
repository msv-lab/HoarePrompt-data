The code snippet `s = str(input())` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The previous value of `s` is overwritten by this new input. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is greater than 0; `s` is the new input string; `i` is `i + 1`.**
