The code snippet provided assigns the list `[i]` to the variable `pans`. This means `pans` now holds a list with a single element, which is the current value of `i`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `mak`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `n` is greater than 0; `s` is the new input string; `i` is `i + 1`; `mak` is `i + 1`; `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`.**
