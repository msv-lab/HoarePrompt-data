The code snippet creates a list named `pans` and assigns it the value `[i]`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `mak`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `s` is the input string and its current value is `<`; `mak` is equal to `i`; `pans` is a list containing the value `i`.**
