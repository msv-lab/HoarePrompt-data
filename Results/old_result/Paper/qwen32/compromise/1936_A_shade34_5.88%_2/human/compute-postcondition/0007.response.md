The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. Given the initial state, the value of `mak` is initially 0. However, after the code execution, `mak` will hold the value of `i`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and the current input string) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` (number of test cases) must be at least 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `mak` is `i`; the current input is the string `'<'`.**
