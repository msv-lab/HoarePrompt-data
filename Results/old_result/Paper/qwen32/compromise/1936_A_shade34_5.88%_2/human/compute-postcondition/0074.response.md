The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. However, the loop's continuation depends on the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. Since the loop iterates `t` times, we need to adjust `t` to reflect that one iteration has just completed.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is at least 1.
- `n` is unchanged.
- `mak2` is 0.
- `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `=`.
- `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the input was `>`, or 0 if no such element exists.

Since the loop iterates `t` times and we have just completed one iteration, we need to decrement `t` by 1 to reflect the remaining number of iterations.

State: **`t` is at least 0 (specifically, `t` is one less than its previous value), `n` is unchanged, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `=`, `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the input was `>`, or 0 if no such element exists**.
