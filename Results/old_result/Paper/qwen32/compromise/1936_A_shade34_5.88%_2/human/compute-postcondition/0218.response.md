To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is at least 0.
2. `n` is the input integer.
3. `mak2` is the final value of `mak` before the loop.
4. `mak` is the last index `i` for which the input was `'>'` (or 0 if no input was `'>'`).
5. `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `'='` and must have at least 2 elements.

### Key Points:
- `mak2` is the value of `mak` before it gets updated in the loop.
- `mak` is the most recent index where the input was `'>'`. If no such input was ever provided, `mak` is 0.
- `pans` is a list of indices where the input was `'='`, and it must have at least two elements.

### Print Statement:
```
print('!', mak2, mak)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will output the string `'!'`, followed by the value of `mak2`, and then the value of `mak`.
- Since `mak2` is the final value of `mak` before the loop, and `mak` is the last index where the input was `'>'` (or 0 if no such input was provided), we need to consider these two values.

### Output:
Given that we do not have the exact values of `mak2` and `mak` from the loop, we can only describe them based on the provided conditions.

- `mak2` is the value of `mak` before the loop modifies it.
- `mak` is the last index where the input was `'>'` (or 0 if no such input was provided).

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **! [mak2] [mak] (where mak2 is the final value of mak before the loop, and mak is the last index where the input was '>' or 0 if no such input was provided)**
