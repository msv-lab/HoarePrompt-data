Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 2, `mak2` is equal to `mak` or `mak2` is 1, `i` is 2, `s` is the new input string. If `s` is `<`, `pans` is `[None, 2]` or `[None, 1, 2]`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[1, 2]` or `[1, 1, 2]`. Otherwise, `pans` is `[2]` or `[1, 2]`.**

Explanation: The value of `pans` is updated by appending the value of `i` (which is 2) to the existing list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
