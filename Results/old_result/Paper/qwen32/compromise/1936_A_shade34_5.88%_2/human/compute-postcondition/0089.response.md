Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `t` is at least 0.
2. `n` is greater than 3.
3. `mak2` is 0.
4. `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `=`.
5. `mak` is set to 2 if the input was `<`, otherwise `mak` retains its original value.
6. `i` is 3.

### Analysis:
- The variable `mak` is only modified if the input was `<`. Since there's no information provided about the input, we can only assume its initial value, which is not explicitly mentioned. However, the problem statement does not give us any indication that `mak` was initially set to any specific value other than the context of it being set to 2 if the input was `<`. Therefore, we can assume `mak` retains its original value, which we can consider to be 0 unless stated otherwise.
- `mak2` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- `i` is explicitly stated to be 3.
- `pans` is a list of indices where the input was `=`. However, since no specific input details are provided, we do not need the exact contents of `pans` for this print statement.

### Print Statement:
```
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Explanation of the Print Statement:
- The first argument is a literal string `'?'`.
- The second and third arguments are both `mak`. Based on the assumptions above, `mak` is 0.
- The fourth and fifth arguments are both `i`. Based on the initial state, `i` is 3.

### Output:
The print statement will output:
```
? 0 0 3 3
```

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **? 0 0 3 3**
