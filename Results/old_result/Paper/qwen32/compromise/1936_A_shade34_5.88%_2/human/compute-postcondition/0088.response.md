The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. The value of `n` must remain greater than 1, and since the loop condition is `i in range(1, n)`, `n` must be at least 4 for `i` to be 3 and still satisfy the loop condition.

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 3, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `=`, `mak` is set to 2 if the input was `<`, otherwise `mak` retains its original value, and `i` is 3**
