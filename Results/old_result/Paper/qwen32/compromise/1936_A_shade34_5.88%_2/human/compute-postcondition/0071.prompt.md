Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t (number of test cases) is at least 1; n is unchanged; mak is 0; mak2 is 0; pans is a list of all indices i for which the input was '='.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '>':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements. If the current input is '>', then `mak` is set to the current index `i`. Otherwise, `mak` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements; `i` is incremented by 1. If the input is '>', `mak` is set to the new value of `i` after it has been incremented.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements; if the input was '>', `mak` is set to the incremented value of `i`; otherwise, `mak` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
