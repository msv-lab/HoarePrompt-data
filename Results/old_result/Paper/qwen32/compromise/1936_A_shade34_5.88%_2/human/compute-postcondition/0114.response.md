The code `pans.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1. Therefore, `pans` will have `1` appended to it.

Let's consider the initial conditions for `pans`:
- If `s` is `<`, `pans` is initially `[None]`. After appending `1`, `pans` becomes `[None, 1]`.
- If `s` is `=`, `pans` is initially `[1]`. After appending `1`, `pans` becomes `[1, 1]`.
- If `s` is neither `<` nor `=`, `pans` is initially `[]`. After appending `1`, `pans` becomes `[1]`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `mak2`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `i` is 1, `s` is the new input string, if the new `s` is `<`, `pans` is `[None, 1]`, if the new `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[1, 1]`, otherwise, `pans` is `[1]`.**
