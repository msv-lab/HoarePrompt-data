The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range it iterates over, which is `len(pans)`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(pans)` and `i` starts from 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented again by 1 from its current value. The length of `pans` remains unchanged.

Given that `pans` must have at least 2 elements, the loop can execute at least once. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to ensure that after the increment, `i` is still less than `len(pans)` for the loop to continue.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- `len(pans)` remains the same and must be at least 2.

State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements; `i` is incremented by 1 (so if it was 1, it is now 2, and if it was 2, it is now 3, and so on). If the input is '>', `mak` is set to the new value of `i` after it has been incremented.** 

Since the exact value of `i` at the start of the next iteration depends on its value at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If the input is '>', `mak` is set to the new value of `i` after it has been incremented.**

To be more specific, if `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2:
State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements; `i` is 2. If the input is '>', `mak` is set to the new value of `i` after it has been incremented.**

If `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 3:
State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements; `i` is 3. If the input is '>', `mak` is set to the new value of `i` after it has been incremented.**

Generalizing, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k+1`:
State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If the input is '>', `mak` is set to the new value of `i` after it has been incremented.**

Since the exact value of `i` at the start of the next iteration is `i + 1` from the end of the previous iteration, we can conclude:

State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements; `i` is incremented by 1. If the input is '>', `mak` is set to the new value of `i` after it has been incremented.**

Given that `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` should be the current value of `i` plus 1. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this increment.

State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements; `i` is incremented by 1. If the input is '>', `mak` is set to the new value of `i` after it has been incremented.**

Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` should be the current value of `i` plus 1. Therefore, if `i` was 1, it is now 2, and if `i` was 2, it is now 3, and so on.

State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements; `i` is 2. If the input is '>', `mak` is set to the new value of `i` after it has been incremented.**

If `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it is now 3:
State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements; `i` is 3. If the input is '>', `mak` is set to the new value of `i` after it has been incremented.**

Generalizing, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it is now `k+1`:
State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements; `i` is incremented by 1. If the input is '>', `mak` is set to the new value of `i` after it has been incremented.**

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements; `i` is incremented by 1. If the input is '>', `mak` is set to the new value of `i` after it has been incremented.**

Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` should be the current value of `i` plus 1. Therefore, if `i` was 1, it is now 2, and if `i` was 2, it is now 3, and so on.

State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements; `i` is 2.**

If `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it is now 3:
State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements; `i` is 3.**

Generalizing, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it is now `k+1`:
State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements; `i` is incremented by 1.**

Therefore
