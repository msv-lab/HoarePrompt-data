To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the variables involved in the print statement.

### Given Initial State:
1. `t` is at least 1.
2. `n` is greater than `i + 1`.
3. `i` is `i + 1`.

### Variables in the Print Statement:
- `mak`: This variable is not defined in the initial state. We do not have any information about its value.
- `mak2`: Similar to `mak`, `mak2` is also not defined in the initial state. We do not have any information about its value.
- `i`: We know that `i` is updated to `i + 1` before the print statement, but the initial value of `i` is not provided.

### Analysis:
- `mak` and `mak2` are not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine their exact values.
- `i` is updated to `i + 1` before the print statement. However, since the initial value of `i` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `i` after the increment.

### Conclusion:
Given the lack of explicit values for `mak` and `mak2`, and the unknown initial value of `i`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **?, mak, mak2, i, mak2 (where mak and mak2 are undefined variables and i is incremented by 1 from its initial value)**
