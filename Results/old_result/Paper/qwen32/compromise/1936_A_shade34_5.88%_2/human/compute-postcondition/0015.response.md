Given the initial state:

- `t` (number of test cases) is at least 1.
- `n` is greater than `i + 1`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

The print statement is:

```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

From the initial state, we know the following:

- `t` is not directly used in the print statement.
- `n` is not used in the print statement.
- `i` is used twice in the print statement and is described as `i + 1`. However, the exact value of `i` before it is incremented is not provided, so we can only describe it as `i + 1`.
- `mak` is not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown. We cannot determine what `mak` is without additional information.

Given this information, the output will contain the string `'?'` followed by the value of `mak` twice, and the value of `i` (which is `i + 1`) twice.

Output: **? [mak] [mak] [i + 1] [i + 1] (where mak is the value of mak and i is incremented by 1)**
