The provided code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the internal buffer of `sys.stdout`, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the console immediately. This operation does not change any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `pans`, `mak`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 3, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `=`, `mak` is set to 2 if the input was `<`, otherwise `mak` retains its original value, and `i` is 3.**
