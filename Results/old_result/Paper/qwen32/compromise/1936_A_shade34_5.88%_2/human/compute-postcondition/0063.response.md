Output State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements; `i` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the variables `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `pans`, or `i`. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the standard output. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged as per the initial state, except that `i` is incremented by 1 as stated in the initial conditions.
