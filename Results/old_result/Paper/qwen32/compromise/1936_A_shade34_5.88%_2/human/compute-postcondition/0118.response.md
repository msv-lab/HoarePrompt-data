Let's break down the given information and determine the output of the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is at least 0.
2. `n` is greater than 2.
3. `mak2` is equal to `mak` or `mak2` is 1.
4. `i` is 2.
5. `s` is the new input string.
6. If `s` is `<`, `pans` is `[None]` or `[None, 1]`.
7. If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[1]` or `[1, 1]`.
8. Otherwise, `pans` is an empty list or `[1]`.

### Code to Execute:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will output a string starting with `?` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` again.
- From the initial state, we know that `i` is explicitly set to 2.
- `mak2` is either equal to `mak` or it is 1.
- The value of `mak` is not explicitly provided, so we can only describe it as `mak`.
- `mak2` is mentioned to be either `mak` or `1`, but since it is printed twice, both occurrences will be the same.

### Output Description:
- The first value after `?` is `mak`.
- The second value is `mak2`, which is either `mak` or `1`.
- The third value is `i`, which is explicitly 2.
- The fourth value is `mak2` again, which is the same as the second value.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **? mak mak2 2 mak2 (where mak2 is either mak or 1)**
