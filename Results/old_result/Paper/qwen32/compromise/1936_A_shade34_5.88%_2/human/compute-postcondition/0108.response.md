The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not set, which means it will start from 0. After the first iteration, `i` will be 0, and for the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. The value of `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `i` is 1, `s` is the input string. If `s` is equal to '<', `pans` is `[None]`. If `s` is equal to '=', `pans` is a list containing one element `i`. Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list.**
