The provided code snippet does not change the values of any variables directly. It only includes a `sys.stdout.flush()` statement, which forces the output buffer to be written to the output device, ensuring that all output is displayed immediately. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `mak`, or `i`.

Given that no changes are made to the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` (number of test cases) must be at least 1; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`; if the current input is the string `'<'`, `mak` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0; `i` is `i + 1`**
