The code `pans.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the list `pans`. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged except for `pans` which now includes the value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `s` is the string input provided; `pans` includes the value of `i`.**
