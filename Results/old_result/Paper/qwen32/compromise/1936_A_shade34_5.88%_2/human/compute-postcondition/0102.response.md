The code snippet `pans = [i]` attempts to assign a list containing the variable `i` to `pans`. However, `i` is not set in the initial state, so this operation would result in a `NameError` because `i` is referenced before it is assigned a value. Since the code would fail at runtime due to this error, we cannot determine a valid output state under the given conditions.

However, if we assume the intention was to assign `pans` to a list containing some placeholder value (like `None`) or if `i` was supposed to be initialized to some value before this line, we can proceed with the assumption that `i` is `None` for the sake of this exercise.

Given that assumption:
Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is `[None]`, `i` is not set, `s` is the input string, and `s` is equal to '<'.**

If `i` were to be set to a specific value before this line, replace `None` with that specific value in the output state. Since `i` is not set, the code would fail, but for the sake of providing an output, we assume `i` is `None`.
