Postcondition: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is equal to `mak` or `mak2` is 1, `i` is 1, `s` is the new input string. If `s` is `<`, `pans` is `[None]` or `[None, 1]`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[1]` or `[1, 1]`. Otherwise, `pans` is an empty list or `[1]`.**

To summarize, after the if-else block executes, `t` remains at least 0, `n` remains greater than 1, `i` remains 1, and `s` retains its value as the new input string. The value of `mak2` can either remain equal to `mak` or be set to 1. The list `pans` will be `[None]` if `s` is `<` and no else part is executed, `[None, 1]` if `s` is `<` and the else part is executed, `[1]` if `s` is `=` and no else part is executed, `[1, 1]` if `s` is `=` and the else part is executed, or it will be an empty list or `[1]` if `s` is neither `<` nor `=`.
