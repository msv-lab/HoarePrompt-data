The loop head in the provided for loop is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable that can be adjusted is `_`, but since `_` is a throwaway variable and does not directly affect the loop's continuation, it does not need to be modified based on the loop's logic. The loop will continue to execute based on the number of times specified by `int(input())`.

However, to adhere to the task requirements and understand the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the context provided by the variables `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `pans`, and `mak`. These variables are not directly part of the loop head, but their states might need to be considered for the logic of the program.

Given that the loop is controlled by the input and not by the variables in the loop head, the state of the variables `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `pans`, and `mak` does not change based on the loop head itself. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is equal to the final value of `mak`, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input string `s` was `=` or the last index `i` for which `s` was `<`. `mak` is the index of the largest element in `pans` for which the comparison resulted in `'>'`.**
