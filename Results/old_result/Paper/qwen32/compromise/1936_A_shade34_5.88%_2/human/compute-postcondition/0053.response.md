Let's analyze the loop and the given output states to determine the final state after all iterations.

### Loop Analysis

The loop iterates `n` times, with `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`. During each iteration, the following actions occur:
1. The program prints a formatted string and flushes the output.
2. It reads an input string `s`.
3. If `s` is `'<'`, it updates `mak` to the current `i` and resets `pans` to `[i]`.
4. If `s` is `'='`, it appends `i` to `pans`.
5. If `s` is neither `'<'` nor `'='`, `mak` and `pans` remain unchanged.

### Given Output States

- **After 1 iteration**: `mak` is `i` if `s` is `'<'`, and `pans` is `[i]`. If `s` is `'='`, `pans` becomes `[0, 1]` if `s` was `'<'` in the first iteration, or `[0]` if `s` was `'='` in the first iteration.
- **After 2 iterations**: `mak` is `i` if `s` is `'<'`, and `pans` is updated accordingly.
- **After 3 iterations**: `mak` is `i` if `s` is `'<'`, and `pans` is updated accordingly.

### Final Output State

After `n` iterations, the final state of `mak` and `pans` depends on the sequence of inputs received:
- `mak` will be the last index `i` for which the input was `'<'`.
- `pans` will be a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `'='`.

### Final Output State Description

- `t` remains at least 1 (the number of test cases).
- `n` remains unchanged (the number of iterations).
- `mak` is the largest `i` (from `0` to `n-1`) for which the input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was received.
- `mak2` remains equal to the initial `mak` (which is `0` at the start).
- `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `'='`.

### Final Output State in Given Format

Output State: **t (number of test cases) is at least 1; n is unchanged; mak is the largest i (from 0 to n-1) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such input was received; mak2 is 0; pans is a list of all indices i for which the input was '='.**
