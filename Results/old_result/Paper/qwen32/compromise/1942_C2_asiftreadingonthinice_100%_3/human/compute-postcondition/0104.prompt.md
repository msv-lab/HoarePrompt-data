Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. `tmp` contains all values `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` where the difference is even and not 2, sorted in ascending order. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and not equal to 2, then `tmp` also includes `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`, sorted in ascending order. `y` is the third input integer, `ii` is 4, `tt` is greater than 4, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, and `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1` minus 3, `ans` is increased by 4 and `y` is decreased by 3. Otherwise, `y` remains the third input integer and the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `tmp` contains at least one element, `ii` is 4, `tt` is greater than 4, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, and `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input such that `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and not equal to 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2. If `y` was originally greater than or equal to `i - 1` minus 3, `ans` is increased by 4 and `y` is decreased by 3 plus `i - 1`. Otherwise, `y` remains the third input integer and the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `tmp` contains at least one element, `ii` is 4, `tt` is greater than 4, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input such that `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and not equal to 2, and `i` is the next element in `tmp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2. If `y >= i - 1`, then `ans` is further increased by `i` and `y` is adjusted to `y - (i - 1)`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement without changing `ans` or `y`. `tmp` contains at least one element, `ii` is 4, `tt` is greater than 4, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, and `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input such that `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and not equal to 2. `i` is the next element in `tmp`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
