Postcondition: **`ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2. If `y >= i - 1`, then `ans` is further increased by `i` and `y` is adjusted to `y - (i - 1)`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement without changing `ans` or `y`. `tmp` contains at least one element, `ii` is 4, `tt` is greater than 4, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, and `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input such that `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and not equal to 2. `i` is the next element in `tmp`.**
