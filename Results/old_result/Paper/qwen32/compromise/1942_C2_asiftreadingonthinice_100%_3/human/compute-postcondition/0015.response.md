The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range it iterates over, which is dependent on the length of the list `a`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, as the loop increments `i` by 1 after each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `tt` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `x` is the second integer from the input.
- `y` is the third integer from the input.
- `ii` is the loop variable and is initialized to 0.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input and sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements.
- `i` is the loop variable, and at the end of the previous iteration, it was 1 (since the loop starts from 1 and we are now at the start of the next iteration).

The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `a`. Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it must be 2 at the start of the next iteration to continue the loop.

State: **`tt` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `ii` is the loop variable and is initialized to 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2**
