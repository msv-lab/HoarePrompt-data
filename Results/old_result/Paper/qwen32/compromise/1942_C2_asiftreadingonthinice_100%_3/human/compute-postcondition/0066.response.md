Postcondition: **`ans` is `x + y - 2`, `y` is the third input integer, `ii` is 4, `tt` is greater than 4, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even, `tmp` contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty list.**
