Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tt` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(tt):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    ans = x + y - 2
    tmp = []
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1
        elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
            tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
    if a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0:
        tmp.append((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)
    tmp.sort()
    for i in tmp:
        if y >= i - 1:
            ans += i
            y -= i - 1
        else:
            break
    ans += y
    print(min(ans, n - 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is 2 times the initial value plus 3, `y` is the initial value minus 4

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is `x + 2*y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2, plus the sum of all elements in `tmp`; `y` is the initial `y` minus the sum of `(i - 1)` for all `i` in `tmp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `x` remain unchanged; `y` is reduced by the sum of `(i - 1)` for all `i` in `tmp` that were processed; `ans` is incremented by `y` plus the sum of all `i` in `tmp` that were processed; `ii` is incremented by `len(a) - 1` for each iteration of the loop; `tt` remains unchanged; `a` remains the same sorted list of integers; `tmp` remains the same list of differences.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
