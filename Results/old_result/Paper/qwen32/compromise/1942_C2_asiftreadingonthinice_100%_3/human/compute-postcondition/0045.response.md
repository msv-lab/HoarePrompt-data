Postcondition: **`tt` is any value, `t` is any value, `n` is 10, `x` is any value, `ii` is any value, `a` is `[1, 5, 9]`, `tmp` is `[2, 2, 3]`, and `i` is 3. If `y` is greater than or equal to 2, then `y` is decreased by 2 and `ans` is increased by 3. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement without changing `y` or `ans`.**
