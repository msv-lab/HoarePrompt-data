Output State: **`tt`, `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `ii`, `a` are as described in the precondition; `ans` is initialized to `x + y - 2` plus the count of pairs with difference 2. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. `tmp` is a sorted list of `(a[i] - a[i-1]) // 2` for even differences not equal to 2. If `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2, then `tmp` includes `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.**

In simpler terms, the list `tmp` has been sorted, while all other variables remain in their previous states as described in the initial conditions.
