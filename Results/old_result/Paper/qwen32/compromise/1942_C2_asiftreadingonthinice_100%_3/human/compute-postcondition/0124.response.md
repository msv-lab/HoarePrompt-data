Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is the initial `y` minus the sum of `(i - 1)` for all `i` in `tmp`. If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` equals 2, `ans` is `x + y - 1`; otherwise, `ans` is `x + y - 2`. `ii` is incremented by 1, `tt` remains unchanged, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input with at least two elements. If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and not equal to 2, `tmp` includes `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` from the current iteration. `i` is incremented by 1.**
