The code snippet `ans += i` modifies the value of `ans` by adding the current value of `i` to it. The other variables remain unchanged as per the provided initial state.

Output State: **`ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2, plus `i`; `y` is adjusted based on the previous condition; `tmp` contains at least one element; `ii` is 4; `tt` is greater than 4; `n` is the first input integer; `x` is the second input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input such that `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and not equal to 2; and `i` is the next element in `tmp`.**
