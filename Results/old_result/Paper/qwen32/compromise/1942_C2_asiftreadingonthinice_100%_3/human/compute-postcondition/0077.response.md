Postcondition: **`ans` is `x + y + 1` if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is `x + y - 1`. `y` is the third input integer; `ii` is 5; `tt` is greater than 4; `n` is the first input integer; `x` is the second input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input with at least 2 elements; `i` is 6. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not 2 and `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0`, `tmp` includes an additional element `(a[6] - a[5]) // 2`.**
