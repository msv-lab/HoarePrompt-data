The code snippet `ans += y` adds the current value of `y` to the current value of `ans`. Therefore, the value of `ans` will be updated to its previous value plus `y`.

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2, plus the sum of all elements in `tmp`.
- `y` is the initial `y` minus the sum of `(i - 1)` for all `i` in `tmp`.

After executing `ans += y`, the value of `ans` becomes:
- `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2, plus the sum of all elements in `tmp`, plus `y`.

The value of `y` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is `x + 2*y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2, plus the sum of all elements in `tmp`; `y` is the initial `y` minus the sum of `(i - 1)` for all `i` in `tmp`.**
