Functionality: **The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left` and `right`, which are integers representing indices in an array `arr` such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr), and `clique`, an integer representing the clique identifier. The function returns an array that is a slice of `arr` from index `left` to `right` (exclusive) and is associated with the specified `clique` identifier.**
