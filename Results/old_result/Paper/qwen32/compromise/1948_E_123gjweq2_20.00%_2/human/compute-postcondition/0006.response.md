The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the range of the loop is determined by `not_mid`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `not_mid` must be greater than 0. Let's analyze the given state and determine the necessary adjustments.

Given:
- `left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr)
- `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier
- `small_element` is left + 1
- `big_element` is right + 1
- `mid` is (right - left) // 2
- `not_mid` is (right - left + 2) // 2
- arr[left] to arr[left + mid - 1] are set to the sequence left + 1 to left + mid
- cliquess[left] to cliquess[left + mid - 1] are set to clique

To ensure the loop executes, `not_mid` must be greater than 0. Let's check the expression for `not_mid`:
- `not_mid` is (right - left + 2) // 2

For `not_mid` to be greater than 0, (right - left + 2) must be at least 2, which simplifies to right - left >= 0. Since we already know that 0 <= left < right, this condition is already satisfied.

However, we need to ensure that `i` is correctly initialized before the loop starts. Since `i` is the loop variable and the loop runs from 0 to `not_mid - 1`, `i` should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure `not_mid` is greater than 0 and `i` is initialized to 0.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr), `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, `small_element` is left + 1, `big_element` is right + 1, `mid` is (right - left) // 2, `not_mid` is (right - left + 2) // 2, `i` is 0, arr[left] to arr[left + mid - 1] are set to the sequence left + 1 to left + mid, and cliquess[left] to cliquess[left + mid - 1] are set to clique**
