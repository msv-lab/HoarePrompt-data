You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

- Annotated Code: 
from math import ceil

testcases = range(int(input()))
for case in testcases:
    (n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    func_1(n, k)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n.
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n
    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
        
    #State: `arr` is a list with blocks of `k` elements filled with consecutive integers starting from `1` up to `cliques`. `cliquess` is a list of `n` zeros.
    print(*arr)
    #This is printed: 1 2 3 ... (cliques * k) (where each number is separated by a space and cliques * k is the total number of elements in arr)
    print(cliques)
    #This is printed: [0, 0, ..., 0] (where there are n zeros in the list)
    print(*cliquess)
    #This is printed: 0 0 0 ... 0 (where there are n zeros)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two integer parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is between 2 and 40, and `k` is between 1 and 2n. It initializes an array `arr` of size `n` and fills it with blocks of `k` elements, each block containing consecutive integers starting from 1 up to the number of cliques (`ceil(n / k)`). Another array `cliquess` of size `n` is initialized with zeros. The function prints the filled `arr` array, the number of cliques, and the `cliquess` array which remains unchanged as all zeros.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: left and right are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr), and clique is an integer representing the clique identifier.
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + i] = small_element + i
        
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
        
    #State: `left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr), `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, `small_element` is left + 1, `big_element` is right + 1, `mid` is (right - left) // 2, and `not_mid` is (right - left + 2) // 2. Additionally, arr[left] to arr[left + mid - 1] are set to the sequence left + 1 to left + mid, and cliquess[left] to cliquess[left + mid - 1] are set to clique.
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
        
    #State: `arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` are `left + 1` to `left + mid`, `arr[left + mid]` to `arr[left + mid + not_mid - 1]` are `big_element` to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)`, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid + not_mid - 1]` are `clique`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `make_array` modifies a portion of the array `arr` from index `left` to `right` (inclusive) by setting the first half to increasing values starting from `left + 1` and the second half to decreasing values starting from `right + 1`. It also assigns the specified `clique` identifier to all elements in the modified portion of `arr`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to assign distinct integers to vertices of a graph and then partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques such that every pair of vertices within a clique can be connected by an edge according to the given condition: \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).

### Program Analysis:
The program uses two functions:
1. `func_1(n, k)`: This function calculates the number of cliques (`cliques`) needed and initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`. It then calls `make_array` for each clique.
2. `make_array(left, right, clique)`: This function assigns values to vertices in the range `[left, right]` and assigns them to the same clique.

### Key Points to Check:
1. **Initialization and Array Assignment:**
   - `arr` is supposed to store the values assigned to each vertex.
   - `cliquess` is supposed to store the clique number for each vertex.
   - `cliques` is calculated using `ceil(n / k)`, which is a reasonable estimate for the number of cliques but may not always be optimal.

2. **Edge Condition Check:**
   - The program does not explicitly check the edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) for every pair of vertices. Instead, it assigns values and cliques in a way that is supposed to minimize the number of cliques, but this is not guaranteed to be correct.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the values assigned to vertices, the number of cliques, and the clique assignment for each vertex.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Edge Condition Not Checked:**
   - The program does not ensure that the assigned values and clique numbers satisfy the edge condition for all pairs of vertices. This can lead to incorrect clique assignments.

2. **Optimal Clique Partitioning:**
   - The program does not guarantee the minimum number of cliques. It simply divides the vertices into `ceil(n / k)` cliques, which may not be optimal.

3. **Global Variables:**
   - The arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are used globally within the `make_array` function, which can lead to issues if the function is called multiple times or if the program is expanded.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues mentioned, the program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure that the edge condition is satisfied for all pairs of vertices and does not guarantee the minimum number of cliques.
