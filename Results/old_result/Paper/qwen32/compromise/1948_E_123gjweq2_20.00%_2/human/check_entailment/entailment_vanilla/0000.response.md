Let's analyze the provided code step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Assign integers**: The program needs to assign distinct integers from 1 to n to each vertex.
2. **Add edges**: Based on the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`, edges should be added between vertices.
3. **Partition into cliques**: The graph should be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques, where each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.

### Analysis of the Provided Code:
- The code defines two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`.
- `func_1` calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)` and initializes two arrays: `arr` (to hold the assigned integers) and `cliquess` (to hold the clique assignments).
- `make_array` is supposed to fill the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays for a given range of vertices `[left, right]` with a specific clique number.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Global Variables**: The arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are used in `make_array` but are not passed as arguments or returned. They are treated as global variables, which can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs.
2. **Logic for Partitioning**: The logic in `make_array` does not correctly ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques based on the given edge condition. It simply assigns numbers in a specific order without considering the edge condition.
3. **Edge Condition Check**: The code does not explicitly check the edge condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` to ensure that the assigned integers create valid edges.
4. **Example Output**: The example output provided in the problem statement is not reproduced by this code. For instance, for `n=5` and `k=4`, the output should be `3 1 5 2 4`, `2`, `1 1 2 1 2`, but the code does not generate this output.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure that the graph is partitioned into the minimum number of cliques based on the given edge condition. The logic for assigning integers and partitioning into cliques is flawed.

**Correctness: False**
