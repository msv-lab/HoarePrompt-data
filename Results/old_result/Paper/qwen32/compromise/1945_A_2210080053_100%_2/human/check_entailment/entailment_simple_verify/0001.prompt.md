You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program: 
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (a, b, c) = map(int, s.split())
        b += c
        print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        a, b, c = map(int, s.split())
        
        b += c
        
        print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
        
    #State: a series of printed results, one for each test case, where each result is either `a - -b // 3` or `-1` based on the condition `c < b % 3`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the provided Python program is correct based on the problem description, we need to carefully analyze the logic and see if it correctly calculates the minimum number of tents required or determines if it's impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Introverts (a):** Each introvert needs a tent alone.
2. **Extroverts (b):** Each extrovert needs a tent with exactly two others.
3. **Universals (c):** Universals can be in a tent alone, with one other, or with two others.

The key points to consider:
- Each introvert requires 1 tent.
- Each extrovert requires 1 tent with 2 others, meaning we can group extroverts in sets of 3.
- Universals can fill any remaining spots in tents.

The program must ensure that:
- All introverts get their own tents.
- Extroverts are grouped in sets of 3.
- Any remaining spots in tents (if any extroverts are left over) are filled by universals.
- If there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots, it's impossible to accommodate everyone.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (a, b, c) = map(int, s.split())
        b += c
        print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
```

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Logic:**
   - The line `b += c` combines the number of extroverts and universals into a single variable `b`. This is because universals can fill the spots left by extroverts.
   - The expression `-b // 3` calculates the number of tents needed for the extroverts and universals, considering that each tent can have up to 3 people.
   - The `a` variable represents the number of tents needed for introverts.
   - The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` is a conditional expression that:
     - Evaluates to `a - -b // 3` (which is equivalent to `a + b // 3`) if `c >= b % 3`.
     - Evaluates to `-1` if `c < b % 3`.

### Correctness Check

- **Condition `c < b % 3`:**
  - This condition checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots after grouping extroverts in sets of 3.
  - If `b % 3` is not zero, it means there are leftover spots that need to be filled by universals.
  - If `c` (number of universals) is less than `b % 3`, it's impossible to fill all spots, and the program correctly returns `-1`.

- **Expression `a + b // 3`:**
  - `a` is the number of tents for introverts.
  - `b // 3` is the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals (grouped in sets of 3).
  - This expression correctly calculates the total number of tents needed if there are enough universals to fill any leftover spots.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents needed or if it's impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

Correctness: **True**
