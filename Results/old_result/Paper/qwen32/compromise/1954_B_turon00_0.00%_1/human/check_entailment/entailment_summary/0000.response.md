### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by identifying the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. However, the current implementation does not correctly address the problem requirements. Here's a detailed analysis:

#### Problem Understanding:
1. **Beautiful Array Definition**: An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \) if \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \).
2. **Objective**: For each test case, determine the minimum number of elements to remove so that the array is no longer beautiful. If it's impossible to do so, output `-1`.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
- For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array \( a \).
- It checks if all elements in the array are the same. If so, it prints `-1` because the array cannot stop being beautiful by removing elements.
- The program then attempts to find the minimum length of consecutive sequences of the first element in the list \( a \). This logic seems flawed for the problem at hand.

#### Issues with the Program:
- **Incorrect Approach**: The program incorrectly assumes that finding the minimum length of consecutive sequences of the first element will solve the problem. This is not the case. The problem requires finding the minimum number of removals to break the "beautiful" property, which involves more complex logic.
- **Incorrect Handling of Non-Uniform Arrays**: The program only considers sequences of the first element, which is insufficient. The "beautiful" property can be maintained by other sequences within the array.
- **Lack of Proper Logic**: The program does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to break the "beautiful" property. It needs to consider all possible sequences and their removal impacts.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic and approach need to be revised to accurately determine the minimum number of elements to remove.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
