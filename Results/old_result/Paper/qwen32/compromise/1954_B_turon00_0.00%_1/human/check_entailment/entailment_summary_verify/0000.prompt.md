You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        tmp = a[0]
        aa = set(a)
        if len(aa) == 1:
            print(-1)
        cnt = 0
        ans = n
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == tmp:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                ans = min(ans, cnt)
                cnt = 0
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines the minimum length of consecutive sequences of the first element in the list `a`. If all elements in the list are the same, it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the minimum length of such sequences.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. Let's analyze the program and identify the issues:

1. **Logic for Counting Consecutive Elements:**
   - The program attempts to count consecutive elements that are the same and then finds the minimum count of such sequences. However, this approach does not correctly address the problem requirements.
   - The problem requires identifying the smallest contiguous subsequence that, when removed, will make the array no longer beautiful. The provided program does not correctly find this subsequence.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly identifies arrays where all elements are the same and outputs `-1` in such cases.
   - However, it fails to correctly handle other cases where elements need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

3. **Example Case Analysis:**
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     5
     1 2 1 2 1
     ```
   - The program outputs `1`, but this is incorrect. Removing a single element (e.g., the second element) does not make the array non-beautiful. The correct output should be `2` because removing two elements (e.g., the second and fourth elements) results in the array `[1, 1, 1]`, which is not beautiful.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve this problem correctly, one needs to identify the longest contiguous subsequence that can be removed to make the array non-beautiful. This involves checking all possible subsequences and determining the smallest one that, when removed, results in an array that is no longer beautiful.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and fails for certain inputs. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
