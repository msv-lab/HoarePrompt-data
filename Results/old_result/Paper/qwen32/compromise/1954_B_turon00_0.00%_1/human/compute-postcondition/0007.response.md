The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`), but the `print` statement does not depend on these variables. It simply prints the integer `-1`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is not used in the `print` statement.
2. **Variable `n`**: An input integer. This variable is not used in the `print` statement.
3. **List `a`**: A list of integers obtained from the input. This list is not used in the `print` statement.
4. **Variable `tmp`**: Assigned the value of `a[0]`. This variable is not used in the `print` statement.
5. **Set `aa`**: A set containing the unique elements from the list `a`. It is mentioned that the set `aa` contains exactly one unique element. This set is not used in the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement is `print(-1)`, it will output the integer `-1` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **-1**
