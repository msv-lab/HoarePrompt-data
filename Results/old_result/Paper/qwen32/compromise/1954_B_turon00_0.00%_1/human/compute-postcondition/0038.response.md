The code snippet simply sets the variable `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, or `ans`. Therefore, the only change in the state is that `cnt` is reset to 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the new list of integers read from the input, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` encountered in the list `a` and is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `aa` contains only one unique element, then `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.**
