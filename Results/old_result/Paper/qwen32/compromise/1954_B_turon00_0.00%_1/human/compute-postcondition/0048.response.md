The code snippet `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated state includes the incremented `cnt`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is the new list of integers read from the input, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt` is incremented by 1**.
