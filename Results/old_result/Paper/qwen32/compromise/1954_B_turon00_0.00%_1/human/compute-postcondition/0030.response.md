To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and their meanings:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 10,000.
   - `n`: The length of the input list `a`.
   - `a`: A list of integers.
   - `tmp`: The first element of the list `a`.
   - `aa`: A set containing the unique elements from the list `a`.
   - `cnt`: The count of the last sequence of elements equal to `tmp` if it ends the list, otherwise 0.
   - `ans`: The minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` encountered in the list `a`.

2. **Understanding `ans`:**
   - `ans` is initialized to the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` encountered in the list `a`.
   - It is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.

3. **Steps to determine `ans`:**
   - The initial value of `ans` is determined by counting the consecutive occurrences of `tmp` starting from the beginning of the list `a`.
   - If the list ends with a sequence of `tmp`, `cnt` is the length of that sequence.
   - `ans` is updated to be the minimum of the initial count and `cnt`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will output the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` encountered in the list `a`.

Since the specific list `a` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` encountered in the list `a`)**
