Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `tmp` is assigned the value of `a[0]`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `tmp` is now the first element of the list `a`, while the values of `t`, `n`, and the rest of `a` remain unchanged.
