The code snippet provided is `cnt = 0`. This line of code reassigns the value of the variable `cnt` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, and `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`.**
