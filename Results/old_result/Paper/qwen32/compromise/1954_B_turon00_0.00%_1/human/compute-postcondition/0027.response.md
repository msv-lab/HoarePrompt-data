Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, and `cnt` is reset to 0.**
