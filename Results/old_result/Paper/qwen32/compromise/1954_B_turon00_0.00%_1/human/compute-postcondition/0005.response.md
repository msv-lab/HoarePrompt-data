Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `tmp` is assigned the value of `a[0]`; `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`.**

In this state, the variable `aa` now holds the unique elements of the list `a` as a set. All other variables retain their initial values.
