Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the new list of integers read from the input, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `cnt` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` if the list ends with `tmp`, otherwise 0. If `aa` contains only one unique element, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found in the list `a`, or `n` if `tmp` is the only element in the list, updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. If `aa` contains more than one unique element, `ans` remains unchanged.**
