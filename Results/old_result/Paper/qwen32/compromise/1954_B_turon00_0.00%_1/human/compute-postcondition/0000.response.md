The given code snippet reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The other variables (`n` and `a`) are mentioned in the precondition but not yet assigned any values in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the execution of this code will only affect the variable `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
