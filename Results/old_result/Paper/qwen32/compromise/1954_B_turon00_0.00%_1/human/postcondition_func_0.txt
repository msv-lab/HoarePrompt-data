The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines the minimum length of consecutive sequences of the first element in the list `a`. If all elements in the list are the same, it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the minimum length of such sequences.
