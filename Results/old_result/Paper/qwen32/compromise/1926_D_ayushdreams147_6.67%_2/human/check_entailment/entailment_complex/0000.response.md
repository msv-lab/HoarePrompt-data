Reasoning: The provided program seems to contain a logical flaw in its approach to solving the problem. The function `func_1` aims to determine the minimum number of groups needed to ensure that no two numbers in the same group share a common bit in their 31 least significant bits. However, the logic within the function does not directly address this requirement. Instead, it attempts to count unique numbers based on their bitwise complements, which does not solve the problem as described.

To correctly solve the problem, one must consider the bitwise representation of each number and ensure that no two numbers in a group share any of the same bits from the 1st to the 31st bit. This can be achieved by using a bitmasking approach or a graph coloring approach where each number is treated as a node and an edge exists between two nodes if they share a common bit in their 31 least significant bits. The chromatic number of this graph will give the minimum number of groups required.

The given function does not implement such a strategy. Instead, it uses a dictionary to track the bitwise complements of numbers, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements. Therefore, the function is incorrect for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
