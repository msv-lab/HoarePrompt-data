The code snippet initializes a variable `res` to 0. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` is between 0 and 2^31 - 1. The execution of the code only affects the variable `res`, setting it to 0. The other variables (`n` and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, `res` is 0.**
