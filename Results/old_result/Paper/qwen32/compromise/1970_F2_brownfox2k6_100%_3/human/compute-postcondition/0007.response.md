Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer representing the current time step, `player` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where keys are player identifiers (strings) and values are their current positions on the field (pairs of integers), `out` is a list containing the player identifier `p` if the position of the player identified by `p` was equal to `blud` in the previous iteration, otherwise `out` now contains the player identifier `p`, `blud` is a pair of integers representing the current position of the Bludger on the field, `p` is the next player identifier in the `player` dictionary.**

In simple terms: The player identifier `p` has been added to the `out` list. All other variables (`t`, `player`, `blud`, and `p`) remain unchanged.
