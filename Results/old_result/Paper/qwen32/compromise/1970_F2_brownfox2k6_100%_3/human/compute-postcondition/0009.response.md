Postcondition: **`t` is a non-negative integer representing the current time step, `player` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is the player identifier `p`. If `player[p]` was equal to `blud`, then the value of `player[p]` is updated to `[-1, -1]` (other key-value pairs remain unchanged), and `out` is a list containing the player identifier `p`. Otherwise, `player` remains unchanged, and `out` is still an empty list. `blud` is a pair of integers representing the current position of the Bludger on the field, and `p` is the next player identifier in the `player` dictionary.**
