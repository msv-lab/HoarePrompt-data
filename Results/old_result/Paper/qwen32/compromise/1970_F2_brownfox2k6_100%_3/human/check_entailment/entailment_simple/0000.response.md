### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly implements the rules and requirements of the Quidditch game as described in the problem statement.

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program correctly initializes the field by reading the grid and storing the positions of goals (`rg` for red goals, `bg` for blue goals), the Quaffle (`ball`), the Bludger (`blud`), and players (`player`).

2. **Game Loop:**
   - The program reads the number of steps (`T`) and then processes each step one by one.
   - For each step, it reads the entity (`p`) and the action (`d`).
     - If the action is `C`, it sets the `carry` variable to the player who caught the Quaffle.
     - If the action is `T`, it resets the `carry` variable and checks if the Quaffle is in a goal. Depending on the goal, it updates the score and prints the appropriate event.
     - If the entity is the Quaffle or the Bludger, it calls `func_1` to move the entity in the specified direction.
     - If the entity is a player, it calls `func_1` to move the player in the specified direction, then calls `func_2` to check if the player is eliminated by the Bludger, and finally updates the Quaffle's position if the player is carrying it.

3. **Functions:**
   - `func_1` correctly updates the coordinates of an entity based on the direction (`d`).
   - `func_2` correctly identifies players that are eliminated by the Bludger and prints the elimination events.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the correct events for scoring goals and player eliminations.
   - At the end of the game, it prints the final score.

### Evaluation:

The program appears to correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem statement. It initializes the field, processes actions for each step, and outputs the required events and final score. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are used appropriately to manage entity movements and player eliminations.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
