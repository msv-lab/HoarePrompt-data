Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases for the robot's movement as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and find a counterexample.

The function `func_1` attempts to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on some specific conditions related to the arrows in the grid. However, these conditions are not comprehensive enough to cover all possible scenarios of the robot's movement.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
><>>
><><
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- The robot starts at (1, 1).
- It can move to (2, 1) and then follow the arrow to (2, 2).
- From (2, 2), it can move to (1, 2) and then follow the arrow to (1, 3).
- From (1, 3), it can move to (2, 3) and then follow the arrow to (2, 4).

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
NO
```

The program incorrectly returns "NO" for this input because it does not correctly simulate all possible movements of the robot according to the rules provided in the problem description. The program seems to have a logic that only checks specific patterns of arrows, which is not sufficient to ensure that the robot can reach the target cell (2, n) in all possible scenarios.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and the Correctness is **False**.
