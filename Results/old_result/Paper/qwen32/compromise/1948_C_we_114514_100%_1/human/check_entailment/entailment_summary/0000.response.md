Reasoning: 
The problem requires determining if a robot can move from the starting position (1, 1) to the target position (2, n) in a grid based on the movement rules defined by the arrows in each cell. The robot can move left, right, up, or down, and then must follow the arrow in the cell it lands on. The conditions for the robot to get stuck and not reach (2, n) are checked in `func_1`.

`func_1` checks the following conditions:
1. For each pair of columns (considered in steps of 2), if the arrow in the first row points left (`<`) and the corresponding arrows in the second row (either the same column or the next column) also point left, the robot cannot move further and hence returns 'No'.
2. If the last cell in the first row points left and the second last cell in the second row also points left, the robot cannot move to (2, n) and returns 'No'.
3. If none of these conditions are met, the function returns 'Yes'.

`func_2` handles reading the input for multiple test cases and applies `func_1` to each test case.

However, the output hint for `func_2` seems to describe a different logic, which doesn't match the problem description. The hint suggests that `func_2` checks if there is at least one position in both strings where the characters are the same, which is not the correct logic based on the problem statement. Despite this discrepancy, the code provided for `func_1` seems to correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement.

Since the problem statement is met by `func_1` and `func_2` is correctly applying `func_1` to each test case, the program is correct based on the implementation of `func_1`.

Correctness: **True**
