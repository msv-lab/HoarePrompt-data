You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, row1 and row2 are strings of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>' characters.
def func_2():
    """
    读取输入并处理每个测试用例。
    """
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        row1 = input()
        
        row2 = input()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, row1, row2))
        
    #State: `n` is the integer and `row1` and `row2` are the strings from the last iteration, and `results` is a list of `t` elements, each being the output of `func_1` for each iteration.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: result1\nresult2\n...\nresultt (where result1, result2, ..., resultt are the outputs of `func_1` for each iteration)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `row1` and `row2`, which are strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and/or '>' characters, and an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The function returns a value based on the comparison of corresponding characters in `row1` and `row2`. If there exists at least one position where both characters are '<' or both are '>', the function returns "Yes". Otherwise, it returns "No".

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
