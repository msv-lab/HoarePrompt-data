### Reasoning:
To determine the winner of the game, we need to consider the sum of coins in both wallets, \(a + b\). The key observation here is that the parity (even or odd nature) of the sum \(a + b\) dictates the winner when both players play optimally.

1. **Even Sum (\(a + b\) is even):**
   - If the sum of the coins is even, Bob will win. This is because Alice and Bob will be able to alternate turns until one of them is left with no coins. Since both players play optimally, they will always leave the opponent with an even number of coins to start their turn. Eventually, Bob will be the one to make the last move, leaving Alice with no valid move.

2. **Odd Sum (\(a + b\) is odd):**
   - If the sum of the coins is odd, Alice will win. This is because Alice can always force Bob to face an even sum at the start of his turn. Alice will start by making the sum even after her first move, and then continue to mirror Bob's moves to ensure that Bob always faces an even sum at the start of his turn. Eventually, Alice will be the one to make the last move, leaving Bob with no valid move.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of \(a + b\). If \(a + b\) is even, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice". This matches the optimal strategy described above.
