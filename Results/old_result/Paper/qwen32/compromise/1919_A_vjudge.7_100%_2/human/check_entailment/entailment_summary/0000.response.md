Reasoning:  
To determine the winner of the game, we need to analyze the game mechanics and the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob. The game revolves around the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins (a + b).

1. **Game Analysis:**
   - If `a + b` is even, the game will always end with Bob winning. This is because the game essentially reduces to a Nim game with two piles. In a Nim game, the player who faces a position where the XOR of the pile sizes is 0 will lose if both players play optimally. Here, the sum being even means that the XOR of the pile sizes will be 0 at the start of Bob's turn (since Alice starts and removes a coin, making the sum odd, then Bob makes it even again, and so on), leading to Bob's eventual loss in an optimal play scenario.
   - Conversely, if `a + b` is odd, Alice will win. This is because Alice can always force Bob into a position where the sum of the coins is even at the start of his turn, leading to Alice's eventual win.

2. **Program Logic:**
   - The program correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of `a + b`. If `a + b` is even, it prints 'Bob', and if `a + b` is odd, it prints 'Alice'. This aligns with the game analysis above.

3. **Execution Summary:**
   - The execution summary confirms that the function reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by reading `a` and `b`, and prints the winner based on the parity of `a + b`. This matches the expected behavior.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the provided problem description.

Correctness: **True**
