### Reasoning:

The problem revolves around determining the winner of a game based on the initial number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The game's outcome depends on whether the sum of coins in both wallets is even or odd. If the sum is even, Bob wins; if odd, Alice wins. This is due to the nature of the game where players alternate turns and must remove a coin from their current wallet, leading to a deterministic outcome based on the parity of the sum.

The program provided reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. It then checks if the sum of the coins is even or odd using the bitwise AND operation (`a + b & 1`). If the result is 0, the sum is even, and it prints "Bob". If the result is 1, the sum is odd, and it prints "Alice".

This logic correctly implements the game's winning condition as described in the problem statement. The bitwise operation `a + b & 1` is equivalent to checking `(a + b) % 2 != 0`, which determines the parity of the sum.

### Correctness:

Since the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of coins in both wallets, it is correct.

**Correctness: True**
