Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program is incorrect because it prints "STAIRS" instead of "STAIR" when the condition `a < b < c` is met. According to the problem description, the output should be "STAIR" for a stair, not "STAIRS". This is a typo in the output string which makes the program incorrect for at least one case.

Here is an example of the incorrect output:
- Input: `1 2 3`
- Expected Output: `STAIR`
- Actual Output: `STAIRS`
