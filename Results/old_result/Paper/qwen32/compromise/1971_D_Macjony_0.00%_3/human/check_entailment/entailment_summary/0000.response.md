### Reasoning:
Let's break down the logic of the provided program and verify if it correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) we need to cut a binary string into, such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

#### Key Observations:
1. **Sorted Binary String**: A binary string is sorted if all '0's come before all '1's.
2. **Contiguous Substrings**: Each piece must be a contiguous substring of the original string.
3. **Minimum Pieces**: We aim to minimize the number of pieces.

#### Approach:
- **Count Transitions**: The critical point in determining the minimum number of pieces is identifying transitions from '0' to '1'. Each transition indicates a potential split point.
- **Adjust Count**: If there is at least one '01' transition, we can merge the last '0' segment with the first '1' segment by rearranging, thus reducing the total number of pieces by one.

#### Program Logic:
1. **Initialization**: Start with `count = 1` because even an empty string or a string with no transitions can be considered as one piece.
2. **Iterate Through String**: Traverse the string and increment `count` whenever a transition from '0' to '1' or '1' to '0' is found.
3. **Adjust for '01' Transition**: If there is at least one '01' transition (`flag = True`), decrement `count` by 1 because we can merge the last '0' segment with the first '1' segment.

#### Verification Against Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1**: "11010" -> Transitions: '1' to '0', '0' to '1', '1' to '0'. Count = 4, Adjusted Count = 3.
- **Test Case 2**: "00000000" -> No transitions. Count = 1.
- **Test Case 3**: "1" -> No transitions. Count = 1.
- **Test Case 4**: "10" -> One transition ('1' to '0'). Count = 2, Adjusted Count = 2.
- **Test Case 5**: "0001111" -> One transition ('0' to '1'). Count = 2, Adjusted Count = 1.
- **Test Case 6**: "0110" -> Transitions: '0' to '1', '1' to '0'. Count = 3, Adjusted Count = 2.

All test cases match the expected output, confirming the logic is correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of pieces required to rearrange a binary string into a sorted binary string.

**Correctness: True**
