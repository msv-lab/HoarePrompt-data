Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is the input string with length greater than 1; `count` is 2; `flag` is True if the character at index `j` of `s` is '0' and the character at index `j + 1` of `s` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False; `j` is 1 if `flag` is True, otherwise `j` remains 0; the character at index `j` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `j + 1` unless `j` has been incremented to 1 and the condition for `flag` being True is met.**
