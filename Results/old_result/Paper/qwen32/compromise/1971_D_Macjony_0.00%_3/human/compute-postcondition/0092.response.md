Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is a string with more than one character; `count` is 4 if `s[j] != s[j + 1]`, otherwise `count` remains 2; `flag` is True if `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False; `j` is less than `len(s) - 2`; `i` is `len(s) + 1`; the characters at index `j` and `j + 1` in `s` are different if `s[j] != s[j + 1]`. `j` is incremented by 1.**
