Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is the input string with length greater than 1; `j` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]` and `s[j]` == '0' and `s[j + 1]` == '1'. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`, `count` is increased by 1. If `s[j]` == '0' and `s[j + 1]` == '1', `flag` is True; otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged.**
