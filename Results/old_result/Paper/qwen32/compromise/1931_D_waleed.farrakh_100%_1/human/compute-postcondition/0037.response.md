The code snippet `freq = {}` reassigns the variable `freq` to a new empty dictionary. This means that any previous contents of the `freq` dictionary are discarded, and it is now an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer representing the size of the array), `x` (an integer representing one of Polycarp's favorite integers), `y` (an integer representing the other favorite integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers representing the elements of the array); `test_cases` must contain at least one more tuple; `results` is a list containing the single element `count`; `freq` is an empty dictionary; `count` is the total number of times pairs have been encountered before.**
