Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 0, `n` is the first integer from `data[2*t-1]`, `x` is the second integer from `data[2*t-1]`, `y` is the third integer from `data[2*t-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[2*t]`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is the string representation of `t` and the remaining elements are the subsequent lines of input, `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples `[(n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr), ..., (n, x, y, arr)]`, `idx` is 2*t, `results` is the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be at least 1, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple `[(n, x, y, arr)]`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be at least 1, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple `[(n, x, y, arr)]`, `results` must contain at least one more value, `result` is the next value from `results`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be at least 1, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple `[(n, x, y, arr)]`, `results` must contain at least two more values, `result` is the next value from `results`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
