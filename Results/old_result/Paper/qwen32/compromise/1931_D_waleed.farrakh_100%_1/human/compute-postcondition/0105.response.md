The code appends the current value of `count` to the `results` list. The `results` list initially contains two elements, both equal to the final value of `count`. After appending, `results` will have three elements, where the first two are the initial values of `count` and the third is the current value of `count`.

Output State: **`test_cases` remains unchanged; `results` is a list containing three elements, all equal to the final value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary containing pairs (a % x, a % y) as keys and their respective counts as values; `count` is the sum of the values in `freq` for all pairs that have been encountered more than once; `n` is `n_next`; `x` is `x_next`; `y` is `y_next`; `arr` is `arr_next`.**
