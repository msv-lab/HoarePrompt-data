The code snippet provided calculates the remainder of an element `a` in `arr` when divided by `y` and assigns it to `ry`. The variables `test_cases`, `results`, `freq`, `count`, and `rx` are not modified by this code snippet. The only change is the introduction of `ry` with a specific value.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer representing the size of the array), `x` (an integer representing one of Polycarp's favorite integers), `y` (an integer representing the other favorite integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers representing the elements of the array); `test_cases` must contain at least one more tuple where `arr` has at least one element; `results` is a list containing the single element `count`; `freq` is an empty dictionary; `count` is 0; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x` for some element `a` in `arr`; `ry` is `a % y` for some element `a` in `arr`.**
