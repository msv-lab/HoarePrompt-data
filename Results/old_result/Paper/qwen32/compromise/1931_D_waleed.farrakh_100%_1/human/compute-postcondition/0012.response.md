The code snippet updates the `arr` variable by mapping the integers from the next line in the `data` list (i.e., `data[idx + 1]`). Given that `idx` is 3, `arr` is updated to the integers from `data[4]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from `data[3]`, `x` is the second integer from `data[3]`, `y` is the third integer from `data[3]`, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[4]`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is the string representation of `t - 1` and the remaining elements are the subsequent lines of input, `test_cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `idx` is 3**.
