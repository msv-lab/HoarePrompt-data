Output State: **`test_cases` remains unchanged; `results` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `count`; `freq` is a dictionary with one key-value pair `((a % x, a % y), 1)`; `n` is `n_next`; `x` is `x_next`; `y` is `y_next`; `arr` is `arr_next` and must contain at least one element; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`**

In natural language: The `freq` dictionary now contains one key-value pair where the key is the `current_pair` `(a % x, a % y)` and the value is `1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
