Postcondition: **`test_cases` remains unchanged; `results` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `count`; `freq` is a dictionary, and if `current_pair` is in `freq`, its value is incremented by 1, otherwise `freq` contains a new key-value pair `((a % x, a % y), 1)`; `n` is `n_next`; `x` is `x_next`; `y` is `y_next`; `arr` is `arr_next` and must contain at least one element; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`; `a` is the next element in `arr_next`. If `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `count` is incremented by `freq[rx, ry]`.**
