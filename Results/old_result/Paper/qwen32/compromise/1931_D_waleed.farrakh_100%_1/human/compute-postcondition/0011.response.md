The code snippet `n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())` will split the string at `data[idx]` into parts, convert each part to an integer, and then assign these integers to `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. Given that `idx` is 3, this means `data[3]` will be split and its parts will be assigned to `n`, `x`, and `y`.

Since `data[3]` is the fourth element in the list `data` (considering `data[0]` is the string representation of `t - 1`, and `data[1]` contains the first three integers `n`, `x`, `y`), the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` will be updated to the integers from `data[3]`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from `data[3]`, `x` is the second integer from `data[3]`, `y` is the third integer from `data[3]`, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is the string representation of `t - 1` and the remaining elements are the subsequent lines of input, `test_cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `idx` is 3**.
