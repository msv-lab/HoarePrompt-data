Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n (an integer representing the size of the array), x (an integer representing one of Polycarp's favorite integers), y (an integer representing the other favorite integer), and arr (a list of n integers representing the elements of the array); `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    freq = {}
    count = 0
    for a in arr:
        rx = (-a % x + x) % x
        ry = a % y
        if (rx, ry) in freq:
            count += freq[rx, ry]
        current_pair = a % x, a % y
        if current_pair in freq:
            freq[current_pair] += 1
        else:
            freq[current_pair] = 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer representing the size of the array), `x` (an integer representing one of Polycarp's favorite integers), `y` (an integer representing the other favorite integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers representing the elements of the array); `results` is a list containing the single element `count`; `freq` is a dictionary with keys as `(rx, ry)` pairs and values as the number of times each pair has been encountered; `count` is the total number of times pairs have been encountered before.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` remains unchanged; `results` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `count`; `freq` is a dictionary with keys as `(rx, ry)` pairs and values as their frequencies; `count` is the total number of times any pair `(rx, ry)` has been seen before.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` remains unchanged; `results` is a list containing three elements, all equal to the final value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary containing pairs (a % x, a % y) as keys and their respective counts as values; `count` is the sum of the values in `freq` for all pairs that have been encountered more than once; `n` is `n_next`; `x` is `x_next`; `y` is `y_next`; `arr` is `arr_next`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
