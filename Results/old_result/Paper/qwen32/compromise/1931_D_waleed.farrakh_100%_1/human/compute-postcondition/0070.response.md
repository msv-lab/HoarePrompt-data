The code appends the value of `count` to the list `results`. Since `results` initially contains only one element `count`, after the operation, `results` will have two elements, both of which are `count`. The values of `test_cases`, `freq`, and `count` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` remains unchanged; `results` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `count`; `freq` is a dictionary with keys as `(rx, ry)` pairs and values as their frequencies; `count` is the total number of times any pair `(rx, ry)` has been seen before.**
