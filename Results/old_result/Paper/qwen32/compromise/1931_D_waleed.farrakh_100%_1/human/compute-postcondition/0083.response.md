Postcondition: **`test_cases` remains unchanged; `results` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `count`; `freq` is an empty dictionary or `(rx, ry)` does not exist as a key in `freq`; `n` is `n_next`; `x` is `x_next`; `y` is `y_next`; `arr` is `arr_next` and must contain at least one element; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)` and `current_pair` is not in `freq`**
