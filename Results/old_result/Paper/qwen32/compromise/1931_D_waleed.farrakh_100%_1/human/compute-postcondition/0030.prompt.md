You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the size of the array, x and y are positive integers representing Polycarp's favorite integers, and arr is a list of integers representing the elements of the array. For each test case, it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i in the range of the array.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    t = int(data[0])
    test_cases = []
    idx = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())
        
        arr = list(map(int, data[idx + 1].split()))
        
        test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
        
        idx += 2
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is the first integer from `data[2*t-1]`, `x` is the second integer from `data[2*t-1]`, `y` is the third integer from `data[2*t-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[2*t]`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is the string representation of `t` and the remaining elements are the subsequent lines of input, `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples `[(n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr), ..., (n, x, y, arr)]`, `idx` is 2*t.
    results = func_1(test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: All elements in `results` have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer representing the size of the array, `x` and `y` are positive integers representing Polycarp's favorite integers, and `arr` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array. The function processes each test case individually. If the array `arr` contains both `x` and `y`, it returns a specific value or result (which is not detailed here) for that test case. If the array does not contain both `x` and `y`, it returns a different value or result (also not detailed here) for that test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
