The code appends a new tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the `test_cases` list. The variables `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `data` remain unchanged. The `idx` variable is also not affected.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from `data[3]`, `x` is the second integer from `data[3]`, `y` is the third integer from `data[3]`, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[4]`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is the string representation of `t - 1` and the remaining elements are the subsequent lines of input, `test_cases` is a list containing two tuples `[(n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr)]`, `idx` is 3**.
