You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and an array `arr`. It processes these test cases by calling `func_1` with a list of tuples containing the test case data. The results from `func_1` are then printed. The function does not modify the input values directly but uses them to produce and print output based on the logic implemented in `func_1`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The task is to find the number of beautiful pairs in an array for multiple test cases. A pair of indices (i, j) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

Let's break down the provided program to see if it correctly implements the solution:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_2` reads the input from standard input and parses it into test cases, where each test case consists of the array size `n`, the integers `x` and `y`, and the array `arr` itself.
   - This part of the code is correct and efficiently parses the input.

2. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   - `func_1` is responsible for counting the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.
   - It uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - For each element `a` in the array:
     - It calculates `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x`. This is equivalent to finding the remainder of `-a` when divided by `x`, adjusted to be non-negative.
     - It calculates `ry` as `a % y`.
     - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`. If it does, it adds the count of this pair to `count` because each occurrence of `(rx, ry)` can form a beautiful pair with the current element `a`.
     - It then updates the frequency of the pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.
   - This approach is correct because it leverages the properties of modular arithmetic to efficiently count the pairs that satisfy the conditions.

3. **Output:**
   - `func_2` calls `func_1` with the list of test cases and prints the results for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to count beautiful pairs in an array for multiple test cases. It efficiently uses a dictionary to track the frequency of pairs and checks the conditions for beautiful pairs using modular arithmetic.
