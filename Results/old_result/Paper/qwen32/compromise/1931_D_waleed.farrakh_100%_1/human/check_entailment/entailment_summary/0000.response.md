### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find pairs `(i, j)` in the array `a` such that:
     - `a[i] + a[j]` is divisible by `x`.
     - `a[i] - a[j]` is divisible by `y`.
   - The task is to count such pairs for multiple test cases.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function processes each test case by iterating through the array `arr`.
   - For each element `a` in `arr`, it calculates two remainders:
     - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x`: This is equivalent to `(a % x)`, but calculated in a way to ensure non-negative results.
     - `ry = a % y`: The remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
   - It then checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` has been seen before in the frequency dictionary `freq`. If it has, it adds the count of that pair to the total `count` of beautiful pairs.
   - It updates the frequency dictionary `freq` with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - Finally, it returns the list of counts for each test case.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads the input from standard input and parses it into test cases.
   - Each test case is a tuple containing `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - It calls `func_1` with the list of test cases and prints the results.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies pairs `(i, j)` based on the problem's conditions.
   - The use of remainders ensures that the conditions for beautiful pairs are checked efficiently.
   - The frequency dictionary `freq` keeps track of previously seen pairs of remainders, allowing the function to count beautiful pairs in linear time relative to the size of the array.
   - `func_2` correctly processes the input and outputs the results as expected.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions together correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
