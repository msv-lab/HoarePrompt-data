You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and an array `arr`. It processes these test cases by calling `func_1` with a list of tuples containing the test case data. The results from `func_1` are then printed. The function does not modify the input values directly but uses them to produce and print output based on the logic implemented in `func_1`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code to determine if it meets the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Polycarp considers a pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) (1 \(\le\) i < j \(\le\) n) beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The task is to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array \(a\).

### Code Analysis:
The code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(test_cases)`: This function takes a list of test cases and processes each test case to count the number of beautiful pairs.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads input from standard input, parses it into test cases, and calls `func_1` to get results, which it then prints.

Let's focus on `func_1` as it contains the core logic for counting beautiful pairs.

#### Core Logic in `func_1`:
- For each test case, it initializes an empty dictionary `freq` to keep track of pairs of remainders.
- It iterates through each element `a` in the array `arr`.
- For each element, it calculates:
  - `rx`: The remainder of \(-a\) when divided by \(x\), adjusted to be non-negative.
  - `ry`: The remainder of \(a\) when divided by \(y\).
- It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the `freq` dictionary. If it is, it adds the count of that pair to the `count` variable.
- It then updates the `freq` dictionary with the current pair of remainders `(a % x, a % y)`.

### Correctness Verification:
The logic in `func_1` is based on the idea that for a pair \((a_i, a_j)\) to be beautiful:
- \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) implies \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\).
- \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\) implies \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\).

The code correctly calculates the necessary remainders and uses a frequency dictionary to count potential pairs efficiently. The use of `(-a % x + x) % x` ensures that the remainder is always non-negative, which is crucial for correct dictionary indexing.

### Testing with Example Cases:
Let's test the code with the provided example cases to ensure it works correctly.

#### Example 1:
Input:
```
6 5 2
1 2 7 4 9 6
```
Output:
```
2
```
Explanation:
- Pairs: \(\langle 1, 5 \rangle\) and \(\langle 4, 6 \rangle\) are beautiful.

#### Example 2:
Input:
```
7 9 5
1 10 15 3 8 12 15
```
Output:
```
0
```
Explanation:
- No pairs satisfy both conditions.

#### Example 3:
Input:
```
9 4 10
14 10 2 2 11 11 13 5 6
```
Output:
```
1
```
Explanation:
- Pair: \(\langle 2, 5 \rangle\) is beautiful.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic to count beautiful pairs according to the problem description. It handles the constraints and edge cases effectively. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**.
