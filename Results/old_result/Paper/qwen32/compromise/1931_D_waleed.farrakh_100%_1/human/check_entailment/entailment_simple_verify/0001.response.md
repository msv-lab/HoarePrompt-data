### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to verify its correctness.

#### Problem Breakdown:
Polycarp considers a pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) (with \(1 \le i < j \le n\)) beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

#### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. **func_2**: Reads the input and organizes it into test cases.
2. **func_1**: Counts the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

#### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`:
For each test case, the program initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs \((a \% x, a \% y)\).

For each element `a` in the array:
- It calculates `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x`. This is intended to find the non-negative remainder of \(-a\) when divided by \(x\).
- It calculates `ry` as `a % y`.
- It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`. If it does, it adds the count of this pair to `count` because each occurrence of `(rx, ry)` can form a beautiful pair with the current element `a`.
- It then updates the frequency of the pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.

#### Key Points:
- The calculation of `rx` is intended to handle the condition \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\). This is because if \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\), then \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\). The expression `(-a % x + x) % x` correctly computes the non-negative equivalent of \(-a \% x\).
- The calculation of `ry` as `a % y` is correct for the condition \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\). This is because if \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\), then \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\).

#### Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program correctly:
- `results` is a list containing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.
- `freq` is re-initialized for each test case and stores the frequency of pairs `(rx, ry)` for the current test case.
- `count` is the total number of times pairs `(rx, ry)` have been seen before for the current test case.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to count beautiful pairs using modular arithmetic and efficiently uses a dictionary to track the frequency of pairs. The annotations also support the correctness of the program's behavior.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
