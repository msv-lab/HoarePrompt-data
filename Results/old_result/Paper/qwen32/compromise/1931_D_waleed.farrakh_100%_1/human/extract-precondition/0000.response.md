Precondition: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the size of the array, x and y are positive integers representing Polycarp's favorite integers, and arr is a list of integers representing the elements of the array. For each test case, it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i in the range of the array.**
