The code snippet converts the integer `f` to its binary representation and removes the '0b' prefix. Given `f` is 3, its binary representation is '11'. Therefore, `l` is updated to '11'. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 5, `m` is 0, `k` is 5, `l` is "11", `p` is 3, `q` is 2, `f` is 3**
