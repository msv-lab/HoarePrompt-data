The code calculates `q` as `2` raised to the power of `p - 1`. Given that `p` is `2`, `q` becomes `2 ** (2 - 1)`, which is `2 ** 1` or `2`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `p`, and `f` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `5`, `m` is `1`, `k` is `4`, `l` is `'11'`, `p` is `2`, `f` is `3`, `q` is `2`**.
