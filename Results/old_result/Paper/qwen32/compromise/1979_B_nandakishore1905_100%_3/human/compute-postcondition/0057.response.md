The given initial state provides the values of several variables: `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `p`, `q`, and `f`. The `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print(f)
```

From the initial state, we know that `f` is explicitly given the value of 1. Therefore, the `print` statement will output the value of `f`.

Output: **1**
