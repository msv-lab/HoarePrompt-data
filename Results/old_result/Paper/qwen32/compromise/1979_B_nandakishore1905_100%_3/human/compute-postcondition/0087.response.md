Postcondition: **`n` is `input_n`, `m` is `input_m`, `k` is `abs(input_n - input_m)`. If `k` is a power of 2, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `k` is odd, the state remains unchanged. If `k` is even and not a power of 2, `n` becomes 5, `m` becomes 1, `k` becomes 4, `l` becomes '1', `p` becomes 1, `f` becomes 1, and `q` becomes 2.**
