Output State: **`n` and `m` are two distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= n, m <= 10^9 and n != m; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. The value of `k` is not a power of two, and `k` is even; `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix; `p` is the length of the binary string `l`; `q` is 2; `f` is `k - q`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `f` is now `k - 2`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
