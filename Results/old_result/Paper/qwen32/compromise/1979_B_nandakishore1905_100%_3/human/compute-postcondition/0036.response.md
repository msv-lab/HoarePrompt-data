Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are two distinct non-negative integers such that `0 <= n, m <= 10^9` and `n != m`.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The value to be printed is explicitly given as `1` and does not depend on the variables `n`, `m`, or `k` in any way.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement is hardcoded to output `1`, the output will be the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
