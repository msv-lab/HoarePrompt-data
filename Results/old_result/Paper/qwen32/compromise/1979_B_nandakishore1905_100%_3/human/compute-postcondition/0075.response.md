The code converts the integer `f` to its binary representation using the `bin()` function and then removes the '0b' prefix. Given that `f` is `3`, its binary representation is '11'. Therefore, `l` is updated to '11'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `5`, `m` is `1`, `k` is `4`, `l` is `'11'`, `p` is `2`, `f` is `3`, `q` is `2`**.
