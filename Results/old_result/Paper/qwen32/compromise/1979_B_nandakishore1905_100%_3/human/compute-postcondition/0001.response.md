The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. This means the initial values of `x` and `y` are no longer relevant to the state of the program after this assignment, as `n` and `m` are now defined by the input.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are two distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= n, m <= 10^9 and n != m**.
