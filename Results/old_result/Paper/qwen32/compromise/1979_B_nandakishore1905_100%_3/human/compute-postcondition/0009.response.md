The code snippet converts the integer `k` to its binary representation, removes the '0b' prefix, and assigns the result to the variable `l`. Given that `k` is even and not a power of two, its binary representation will have at least two '1's and will not be a single '1' followed by zeros.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are two distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= n, m <= 10^9 and n != m; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. The value of `k` is not a power of two, and `k` is even; `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**
