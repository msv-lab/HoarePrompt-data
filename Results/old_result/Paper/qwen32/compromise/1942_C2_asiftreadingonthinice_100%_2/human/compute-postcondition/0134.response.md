Postcondition: **`ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times `a[i] - a[i - 1]` equals 2, `tmp` is a list containing `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for each pair of consecutive elements in `a` where `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is an even number other than 2, `y` is an input integer, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `tt` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2.**
