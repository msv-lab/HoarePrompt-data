The provided code snippet is `ans += i`. This line increases the value of `ans` by the value of `i`.

Given the initial state, `i` is the next element in the sorted list `tmp`. Therefore, `ans` will be updated to its current value plus the value of `i`.

The other variables, such as `a`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `ii`, `tt`, and `tmp`, are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer minus (`i - 1`) if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, otherwise `y` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `tt` remains unchanged, `tmp` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, and `i` is the next element in `tmp`. `ans` is the initial value of `ans` plus `i`.**
