The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is `x + y - 1 + 1` if `a[i] - a[i - 1]` equals 2, otherwise `ans` is `x + y - 2 + 1`. `y` is an input integer, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `tt` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements. If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and not equal to 2, `tmp` is a list containing the element `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`; otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty list. `i` is `i + 1`.**
