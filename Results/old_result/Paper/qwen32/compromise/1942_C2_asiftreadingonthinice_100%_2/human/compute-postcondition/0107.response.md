The only variable in the loop head is `ii` and `tt`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the loop:
```python
for ii in range(tt):
    # the loop body is omit
```
At the end of the previous iteration, `ii` was some value, and `tt` is the total number of iterations the loop will perform.

To proceed to the next iteration:
- `ii` will be incremented by 1.
- `tt` remains unchanged as it defines the total number of iterations.

Since the state provided does not give the exact value of `ii` at the end of the previous iteration, we can denote the new value of `ii` as `ii + 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:
State: **`ans` is Initial `ans` + sum(tmp) + Initial `y` - sum(i - 1 for i in tmp); `y` is Initial `y` - sum(i - 1 for i in tmp); `ii` is `ii + 1`; `tt` remains unchanged**
