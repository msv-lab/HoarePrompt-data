The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The other variables (`tt`, `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `ii`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tt` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ `n` - `x`; `ii` is 0; `a` is a list of integers provided by the input.**
