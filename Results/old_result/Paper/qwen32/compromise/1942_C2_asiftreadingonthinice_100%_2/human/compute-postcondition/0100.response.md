The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `i`. The variable `tmp` remains a non-empty list with at least one more element after the current `i`, and `i` remains the next element in `tmp`. Therefore, the Output State is: `tmp` is a non-empty list with at least one more element after the current `i`, `i` is the next element in `tmp`, and `ans` is increased by the value of `i`.

Output State: **`tmp` is a non-empty list with at least one more element after the current `i`; `i` is the next element in `tmp`; `ans` is increased by the value of `i`.**
