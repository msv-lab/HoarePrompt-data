The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The initial value of `ans` is `x + y - 2`. After the increment, `ans` becomes `x + y - 2 + 1`, which simplifies to `x + y - 1`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is `x + y - 1`, `y` is an input integer, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `tt` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `tmp` is an empty list, and `a[i] - a[i - 1]` equals 2.**
