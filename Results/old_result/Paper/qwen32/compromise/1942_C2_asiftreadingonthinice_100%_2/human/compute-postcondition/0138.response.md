Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `tt` remains unchanged. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2, then `ans` is `x + y - 1` plus the number of times `a[i] - a[i - 1]` equals 2. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2, then `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times `a[i] - a[i - 1]` equals 2. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even, `tmp` is a list containing `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for each pair of consecutive elements in `a` where `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is an even number other than 2, plus `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`. Otherwise, `tmp` is a list containing `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for each pair of consecutive elements in `a` where `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is an even number other than 2.**
