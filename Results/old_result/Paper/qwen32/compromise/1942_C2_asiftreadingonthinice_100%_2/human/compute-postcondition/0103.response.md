Postcondition: **`tmp` is a non-empty list with at least one more element after the current `i`, and `i` is the next element in `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `ans` is increased by the value of `i` and `y` is decreased by `i - 1`. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
