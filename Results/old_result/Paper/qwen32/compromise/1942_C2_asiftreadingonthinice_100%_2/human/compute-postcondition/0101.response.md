The value of `y` is decreased by `i - 1`. The values of `tmp`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `tmp` is a non-empty list with at least one more element after the current `i`; `i` is the next element in `tmp`; `ans` is increased by the value of `i`; `y` is decreased by `i - 1`.

Output State: **`tmp` is a non-empty list with at least one more element after the current `i`; `i` is the next element in `tmp`; `ans` is increased by the value of `i`; `y` is decreased by `i - 1`.**
