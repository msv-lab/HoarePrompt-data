Postcondition: **`tt` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 * 10^5); `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ `n` - `x`; `ii` is 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input; `i` is len(a) - 1; `ans` is the initial value of `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` was 2; `tmp` is a list containing half of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that were even but not 2; the sum of the first element of `a` and `n` minus the last element of `a` is even.**
