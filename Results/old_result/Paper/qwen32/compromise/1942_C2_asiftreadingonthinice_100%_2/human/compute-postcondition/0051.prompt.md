Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tt` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 * 10^5); `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ `n` - `x`; `ii` is 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input; `i` is len(a) - 1; `ans` is the initial value of `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` was 2, plus 1 if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2; `tmp` is a sorted list containing half of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that were even but not 2, and if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and not 2, `tmp` also contains the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tt` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 * 10^5); `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ `n` - `x` and if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)`. `ii` is 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input; `i` is len(a) - 1; `ans` is the initial value of `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` was 2, plus 1 if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2, plus `len(a) - 1` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`; `tmp` is a sorted list containing at least one element; if `y` is less than `i - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tt` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 * 10^5); `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ `n` - `x` and if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)`. `ii` is 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input; `i` is the next element in `tmp` after the current value; `ans` is the initial value of `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` was 2, plus 1 if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2, plus `len(a) - 1` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, plus `i` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`. `tmp` is a sorted list containing at least one element; if `y` is less than `i - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tt` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer where if `y` was originally greater than or equal to `i - 1`, it is updated to `y - (i - 1)`, otherwise `y` remains unchanged, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `i` is the next element in `tmp`, `ans` is recalculated based on the new value of `i` and is equal to `ans` + `i` if `y` was originally greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `tmp` is a sorted list containing at least one element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
