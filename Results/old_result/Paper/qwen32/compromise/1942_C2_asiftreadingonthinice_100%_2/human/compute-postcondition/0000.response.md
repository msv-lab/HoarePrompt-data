Output State: **`tt` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ `n` - `x`. The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `tt` is assigned the value of the first integer input, representing the number of test cases. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`) and their constraints remain unchanged as they are not affected by the executed code snippet.
