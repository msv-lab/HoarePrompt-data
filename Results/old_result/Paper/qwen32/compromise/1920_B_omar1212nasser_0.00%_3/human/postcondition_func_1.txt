The function accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`, where `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, and `elements` is a list of integers. If `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the maximum value from a list `pos`, which contains `removals + 1` elements. The first element of `pos` is calculated as the sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements, and subsequent elements are calculated similarly after iteratively removing elements from the end of the list.
