You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: removals and negatives are non-negative integers, and elements is a list of integers.
def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    if (removals == 6 and negatives == 3) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: removals and negatives are non-negative integers, and elements is a list of integers. It is not the case that removals is 6 and negatives is 3.
    pos = []
    s = sum(elements)
    n = sum(elements[-negatives:])
    pos.append(s - 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, removals + 1):
        s -= elements[-i]
        
        try:
            n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]
        except IndexError:
            n = 0
        
        pos.append(s - 2 * n)
        
    #State: `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, and `elements` is a list of integers. It is not the case that `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3; `pos` is a list containing `removals + 1` elements where the first element is `s - 2 * n` (initial value) and the subsequent elements are calculated as `s - 2 * n` after each iteration of the loop; `s` is the sum of the first `len(elements) - removals` elements; `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements minus the sum of the last `removals` elements, or 0 if an `IndexError` occurred.
    return max(pos)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, where `pos` is a list containing `removals + 1` elements, with the first element being `s - 2 * n` and subsequent elements calculated similarly.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`, where `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, and `elements` is a list of integers. The function returns 0 if a certain condition is met. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the maximum value from a list `pos`, which contains `removals + 1` elements. The first element of `pos` is calculated as `s - 2 * negatives`, where `s` is likely a derived value from `elements`, and subsequent elements are calculated similarly.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, where `pos` is a list containing `removals + 1` elements, with the first element being `s - 2 * n` and subsequent elements calculated similarly.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
