### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided code. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Alice's Move**:
   - The code sorts the array and considers removing up to `k` smallest elements. This part is logically correct.
   
2. **Bob's Move**:
   - The code attempts to calculate the effect of flipping the `x` smallest elements after each removal by Alice. However, the implementation is flawed.
   
3. **Hardcoded Case**:
   - The function `func_2` includes a hardcoded case for `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3`, which is incorrect and does not generalize to all cases. This is a clear flaw in the code.
   
4. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**:
   - The code incorrectly calculates the sum after flipping elements. It subtracts twice the sum of the `x` largest elements, which is not the correct approach. The correct approach is to flip the `x` smallest elements in the remaining array after Alice's removal.

### Correct Approach:
- **Alice's Move**: Sort the array and remove the `k` smallest elements.
- **Bob's Move**: After Alice's removal, sort the remaining array and flip the `x` smallest elements.

### Correct Implementation:
The corrected version of the code provided in the original assessment correctly implements the optimal strategy:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        # Alice removes the k smallest elements
        remaining = a[k:]
        # Bob flips the x smallest elements
        remaining[:x] = [-elem for elem in remaining[:x]]
        print(sum(remaining))

# Call the function to execute the solution
func_1()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob's moves. The hardcoded case and incorrect sum calculation are significant issues that lead to incorrect results in many scenarios. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Final: **False**
