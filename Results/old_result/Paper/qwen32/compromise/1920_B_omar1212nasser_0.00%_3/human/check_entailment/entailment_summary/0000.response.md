Reasoning:

The provided code does not correctly implement the described game strategy for Alice and Bob. Let's analyze the functions in detail to understand why it is incorrect.

### Function `func_1`:
- This function reads the input, processes each test case, and calls `func_2` with the appropriate parameters.
- The function correctly reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a`.
- It sorts the list `a` and then calls `func_2` to compute the result based on the sorted list and the given `k` and `x` values.
- The result from `func_2` is then printed.

### Function `func_2`:
- This function is intended to compute the optimal sum of the array after Alice and Bob have made their moves.
- The function first checks if `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, returning 0 in that specific case. This is an arbitrary condition that does not align with the game rules and does not generalize to other cases.
- It then initializes `pos` with the first candidate sum, which is the total sum of the array minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements. This candidate sum represents the scenario where Alice does not remove any elements, and Bob inverts the `negatives` largest elements.
- The function then iteratively removes elements from the end of the sorted list (which are the smallest elements) and updates the candidate sums. However, the way the candidate sums are updated does not correctly reflect the optimal strategy for both players.
- The candidate sums are computed as `s - 2 * n`, where `s` is the current sum of the remaining elements and `n` is the sum of the `negatives` largest elements among the remaining elements. This logic does not account for the optimal removal and inversion strategy.

### Key Issues:
1. **Arbitrary Condition**: The function returns 0 if `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, which is not a general solution and does not align with the problem description.
2. **Incorrect Candidate Sum Calculation**: The way candidate sums are calculated does not reflect the optimal strategy for both players. It does not consider the optimal number of elements Alice should remove and the optimal elements Bob should invert to achieve the desired result.
3. **Lack of General Strategy**: The function does not implement a general strategy for determining the optimal moves for Alice and Bob.

### Correct Strategy:
- Alice should remove the `k` smallest elements to maximize the sum.
- Bob should invert the `x` smallest elements among the remaining elements to minimize the sum.
- The correct implementation should involve sorting the array, removing the `k` smallest elements, and then inverting the `x` smallest elements among the remaining elements.

Given the issues in `func_2`, the entire program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
