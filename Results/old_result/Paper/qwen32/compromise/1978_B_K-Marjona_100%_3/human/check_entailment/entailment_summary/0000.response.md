### Reasoning:

The program's goal is to determine the maximum profit Bob can make from selling `n` buns under the given promotion rules. The key steps in the program are:

1. **Reading Input:** The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Determining `k`:** For each test case, it calculates `k = min(n, b - a)`. This value represents the maximum number of buns that can be sold at the modified price, constrained by both the number of buns available and the difference between the original price and the promotional price.

3. **Calculating Profit:**
   - If `b <= a`, it means selling at the modified price does not yield more profit than the usual price, so the total profit is simply `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, the total profit is calculated as:
     - `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`: This part calculates the total revenue from selling `k` buns at the modified prices. The sum of the first `k` terms of the sequence `b, b-1, b-2, ..., b-k+1` can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
     - `(n - k) * a`: This part calculates the revenue from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`.

The program correctly implements the logic to compute the maximum profit for each test case. It handles the edge cases where `b <= a` and ensures that `k` is within the valid range.
