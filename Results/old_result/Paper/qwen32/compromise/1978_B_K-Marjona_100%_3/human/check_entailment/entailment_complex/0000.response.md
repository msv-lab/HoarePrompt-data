### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the maximum profit Bob can achieve from selling his buns based on the promotion rules described in the problem. Let's break down the logic and verify its correctness:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of buns), `a` (usual price of a bun), and `b` (price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price).

2. **Determine `k`:**
   - `k` is the number of buns to be sold at the modified price. The program calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This makes sense because:
     - If `b - a` is less than `n`, it means that the price of the first `b - a` buns at the modified price is greater than or equal to the usual price `a` for the remaining buns. Selling more than `b - a` buns at the modified price would not be optimal.
     - If `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, it means that all buns can be sold at the modified price.

3. **Calculate Profit:**
   - If `b <= a`, then selling all buns at the usual price `a` is optimal. The profit is simply `a * n`.
   - If `b > a`, then the profit calculation is done in two parts:
     - The profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price is `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`. This formula calculates the sum of the series `b + (b-1) + (b-2) + ... + (b-k+1)`.
     - The profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price is `(n - k) * a`.
     - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program outputs the calculated maximum profit.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases:

- **Test Case 1: `n = 4, a = 4, b = 5`**
  - `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = 1`
  - Profit = `(5 * 1 - 1 * 0 // 2) + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`
  
- **Test Case 2: `n = 5, a = 5, b = 9`**
  - `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = 4`
  - Profit = `(9 * 4 - 4 * 3 // 2) + (5 - 4) * 5 = 36 - 6 + 5 = 35`
  
- **Test Case 3: `n = 10, a = 10, b = 5`**
  - `k = min(10, 5 - 10) = 0` (since `b - a` is negative)
  - Profit = `10 * 10 = 100`
  
- **Test Case 4: `n = 5, a = 5, b = 11`**
  - `k = min(5, 11 - 5) = 5`
  - Profit = `(11 * 5 - 5 * 4 // 2) + (5 - 5) * 5 = 55 - 10 = 45`
  
- **Test Case 5: `n = 10^9, a = 10^9, b = 10^9`**
  - `k = min(10^9, 10^9 - 10^9) = 0`
  - Profit = `10^9 * 10^9 = 10^18`
  
- **Test Case 6: `n = 10^9, a = 10^9, b = 1`**
  - `k = min(10^9, 1 - 10^9) = 0`
  - Profit = `10^9 * 10^9 = 10^18`
  
- **Test Case 7: `n = 1000, a = 1, b = 1000`**
  - `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1) = 999`
  - Profit = `(1000 * 999 - 999 * 998 // 2) + (1000 - 999) * 1 = 999000 - 498501 + 1 = 500500`

All test cases match the expected outputs, confirming the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the maximum profit for each test case based on the given rules.

**Correctness: True**
