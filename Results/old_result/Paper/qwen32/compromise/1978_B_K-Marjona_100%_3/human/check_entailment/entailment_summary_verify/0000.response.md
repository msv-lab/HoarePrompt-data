### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary.

#### Problem Recap:
Bob sells `n` buns. The first `k` buns are sold at decreasing prices starting from `b` down to `b-k+1`, and the remaining `n-k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`. We need to find the maximum profit Bob can obtain.

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
```

#### Function Summary Recap:
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it computes and prints a specific value based on the relationship between `a` and `b`, and the value of `n`. The output for each test case is printed sequentially.

#### Analysis:
1. **Case when `b <= a`:**
   - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, then it's optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
   - The program correctly handles this case by printing `a * n`.

2. **Case when `b > a`:**
   - The program calculates the optimal `k` as `min(n, b - a)`.
   - The profit from selling the first `k` buns at modified prices is calculated as `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
   - The profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a` is `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.

#### Edge Cases:
1. **When `n = 1`:**
   - If `b > a`, `k` will be 1, and the profit will be `b`.
   - If `b <= a`, the profit will be `a`.
   - Both cases are correctly handled by the program.

2. **When `b = a`:**
   - The program correctly handles this by selling all buns at the usual price `a`.

3. **When `b - a < n`:**
   - The program correctly calculates `k` as `b - a` and computes the profit accordingly.

4. **When `b - a >= n`:**
   - The program correctly calculates `k` as `n` and computes the profit accordingly.

5. **Large Values:**
   - The program handles large values of `n`, `a`, and `b` correctly due to the use of integer arithmetic.

#### Detailed Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example cases:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `4 4 5`
   - Calculation:
     - `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = min(4, 1) = 1`
     - Profit: `5 * 1 - 1 * (1 - 1) // 2 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 0 + 12 = 17`
   - Output: `17` (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `5 5 9`
   - Calculation:
     - `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = min(5, 4) = 4`
     - Profit: `9 * 4 - 4 * (4 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 4) * 5 = 36 - 6 + 5 = 35`
   - Output: `35` (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `10 10 5`
   - Calculation:
     - `k = min(10, 5 - 10) = min(10, -5) = 0`
     - Profit: `10 * 0 - 0 * (0 - 1) // 2 + (10 - 0) * 10 = 0 + 0 + 100 = 100`
   - Output: `100` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `5 5 11`
   - Calculation:
     - `k = min(5, 11 - 5) = min(5, 6) = 5`
     - Profit: `11 * 5 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 55 - 10 + 0 = 45`
   - Output: `45` (Correct)

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
   - Calculation:
     - `k = min(1000000000, 1000000000 - 1000000000) = min(1000000000, 0) = 0`
     - Profit: `1000000000 * 0 - 0 * (0 - 1) // 2 + (1000000000 - 0) * 1000000000 = 0 + 0 + 1000000000000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - Output: `1000000000000000000` (Correct)

6. **Sixth Test Case:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1`
   - Calculation:
     - `k = min(1000000000, 1 - 1000000000) = min(1000000000, -999999999) = 0`
     - Profit: `1000000000 * 0 - 0 * (0 - 1) // 2 + (1000000000 - 0) * 1000000000 = 0 + 0 + 1000000000000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - Output: `1000000000000000000` (Correct)

7. **Seventh Test Case:**
   - Input: `1000 1 1000`
   - Calculation:
     - `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1) = min(1000, 999) = 999`
     - Profit: `1000 * 999 - 999 * (999 - 1) // 2 + (1000 - 999) * 1 = 999000 - 498501 + 1 = 500500`
   - Output: `500500` (Correct)

The program correctly computes the maximum profit for all provided test cases and edge cases. It handles both small and large values efficiently.
