Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

Bob has `n` buns to sell. The usual price of a bun is `a` coins, but he can sell the first `k` buns at a decreasing price starting from `b` coins down to `(b - k + 1)` coins. The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

The goal is to find the maximum profit Bob can obtain by choosing an optimal `k`.

### Key Points

1. **Choosing `k`:** Bob can choose any `k` such that `0 <= k <= min(n, b)`. If `b <= a`, it's always better to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price won't be higher.
2. **Calculating Profit:**
   - For the first `k` buns, the total revenue is the sum of an arithmetic sequence from `b` down to `(b - k + 1)`. This can be calculated as `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
   - For the remaining `(n - k)` buns, the total revenue is `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
```

1. **Reading Input:** The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. **Choosing `k`:** The program sets `k = min(n, b - a)`. This is a reasonable choice because:
   - If `b - a` is less than `n`, then selling more than `b - a` buns at the modified price would result in negative prices, which is not allowed.
   - If `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, then selling up to `n` buns at the modified price is feasible.
3. **Calculating Profit:**
   - If `b <= a`, the program correctly calculates the profit as `a * n` because selling all buns at the usual price is optimal.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the profit for the optimal `k` using the formula `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given conditions. It handles all edge cases, such as when `b <= a` and when `b - a` is less than `n`.

### Final Answer

Reasoning: The program correctly calculates the maximum profit by choosing the optimal `k` and using the correct formula for the profit. It handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
