The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `b`, so for the loop to execute again, `b` must be less than `a`. We need to adjust `i` to `b + 1` for the next iteration.

State: **`k` is `b`, `i` is `b + 1`, `a` must be greater than `b + 1`**
