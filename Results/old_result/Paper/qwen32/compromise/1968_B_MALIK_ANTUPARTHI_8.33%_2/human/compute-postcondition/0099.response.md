The `break` statement does not affect the values of variables; it only terminates the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, the values of `j` and `k` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `j` is `j + 1`
- `k` is `j + 1`

Since the `break` statement does not change the values of `j` and `k`, the output state remains the same.

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `k` is `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
