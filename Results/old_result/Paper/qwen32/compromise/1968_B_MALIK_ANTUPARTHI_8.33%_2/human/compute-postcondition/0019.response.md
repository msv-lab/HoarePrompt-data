The code snippet `k = j + 1` updates the value of `k` to be `j + 1`. The initial state specifies that `j` is `j + 2` (since `j` was incremented by 1 before the code snippet and then incremented again by the code snippet's effect). Therefore, `k` will now be `j + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer; the sum of all `n` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of all `m` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `d` is an input string; `e` is the value of the user input; `j` is `j + 2`; `k` is `j + 1`.**
