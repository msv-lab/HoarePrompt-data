The `break` statement will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is placed in, but it does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `k`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is `j + 1`, `i` is `b + 2`, `a` is greater than `b + 2`, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is a new input integer, `d` is a new input string, `e` is a new input string, and the character at index `j` of `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` to the end of `e`. Additionally, either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
