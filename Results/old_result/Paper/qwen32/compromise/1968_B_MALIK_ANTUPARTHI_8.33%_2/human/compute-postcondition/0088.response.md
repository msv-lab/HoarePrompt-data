Output State: **`k` is `j + 1`, `i` is `b + 2`, `a` is greater than `b + 2`, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is the second new input integer, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the new input string, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `j` is `j + 1`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values.
