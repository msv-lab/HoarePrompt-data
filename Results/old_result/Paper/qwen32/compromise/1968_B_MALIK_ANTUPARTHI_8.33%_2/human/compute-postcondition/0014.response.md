Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer and must be greater than 0; `c` is an integer; the sum of all `n` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of all `m` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `d` is an input string; `e` is the value of the user input; `k` is `j`; the character `d[j]` is not in the substring `e[k:]`.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to `j`. All other variables retain their initial values and constraints.
