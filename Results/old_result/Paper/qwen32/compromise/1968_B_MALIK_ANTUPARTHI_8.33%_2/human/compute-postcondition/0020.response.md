Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer; the sum of all `n` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of all `m` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `d` is an input string; `e` is the value of the user input; `j` is `j + 2`; `k` is `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that the program will exit the most internal loop or if statement.
