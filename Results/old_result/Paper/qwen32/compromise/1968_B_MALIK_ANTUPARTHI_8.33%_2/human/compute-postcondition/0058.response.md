Postcondition: **`k` is either `e.index(d[j]) + 1` if the character at index `j` of `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` to the end of `e`, or `j` if `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`. `i` is `b + 1`, `a` is greater than `b + 1`, `b` is greater than or equal to `1`, `c` is the second input integer, `d` is the third input string, and `e` is the fourth input string. `j` is `j + 1`. If `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
