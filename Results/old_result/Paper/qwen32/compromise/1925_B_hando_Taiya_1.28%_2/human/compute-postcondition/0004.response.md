To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the definition of the variable `ans`.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
2. `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq n \leq x \leq 10^8\).
3. `ans` is defined as the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or such that `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`.

### Understanding `ans`:
- `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`. This means we are looking for the largest number `d` such that:
  - \(d \leq n\)
  - \(x \mod d = 0\) (i.e., `d` divides `x` without a remainder)

### Steps to Determine `ans`:
1. Iterate through all integers from `n` down to 1.
2. For each integer `d`, check if `d` divides `x` without a remainder.
3. The first `d` that satisfies this condition is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`, and this becomes the value of `ans`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `x = 100` and `n = 10` as an example:
- We start checking from `d = 10`:
  - 100 % 10 == 0, so `d = 10` is a divisor of 100.
  - Since `d = 10` is the largest divisor of 100 that is less than or equal to 10, `ans` is 10.

### General Case:
Given the constraints, the exact numerical value of `ans` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `x` and `n`. However, we can describe `ans` precisely based on the conditions provided:
- `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to n)**
