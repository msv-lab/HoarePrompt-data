Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
Bob sells `n` buns. The usual price per bun is `a` coins, but he can sell the first `k` buns at a modified price, where the `i-th` bun (1 ≤ i ≤ k) is sold for `(b - i + 1)` coins. The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins. The goal is to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Handling `b <= a`**:
   - If `b <= a`, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price is not beneficial.
   - The program correctly handles this case by printing `a * n`.

2. **Calculating Maximum Profit for `b > a`**:
   - When `b > a`, the program calculates `k = min(n, b - a)`.
   - The profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price is `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
     - This is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series: `(b - 0) + (b - 1) + ... + (b - (k - 1))`.
   - The profit from selling the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price is `(n - k) * a`.
   - The program correctly sums these two parts and prints the result.

### Testing the Program:
Let's consider the provided examples and some edge cases:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `4 4 5`
   - Expected Output: `17` (k = 1, profit = 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17)
   - Program Output: `17` (Correct)

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `5 5 9`
   - Expected Output: `35` (k = 5, profit = 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35)
   - Program Output: `35` (Correct)

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `10 10 5`
   - Expected Output: `100` (k = 0, profit = 10 * 10 = 100)
   - Program Output: `100` (Correct)

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: `5 5 11`
   - Expected Output: `45` (k = 5, profit = 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 = 45)
   - Program Output: `45` (Correct)

5. **Example 5**:
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
   - Expected Output: `1000000000000000000` (k = 0, profit = 1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000)
   - Program Output: `1000000000000000000` (Correct)

6. **Example 6**:
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1`
   - Expected Output: `1000000000000000000` (k = 0, profit = 1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000)
   - Program Output: `1000000000000000000` (Correct)

7. **Example 7**:
   - Input: `1000 1 1000`
   - Expected Output: `500500` (k = 1000, profit = 1000 + 999 + ... + 1 = 500500)
   - Program Output: `500500` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the provided examples and edge cases. It correctly calculates the maximum profit for all possible values of `n`, `a`, and `b` within the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**.
