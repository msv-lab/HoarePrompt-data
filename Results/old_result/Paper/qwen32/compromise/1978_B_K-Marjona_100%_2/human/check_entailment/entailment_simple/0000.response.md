### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given promotion rules. Let's break down the logic and verify if it aligns with the problem description.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the integers `n`, `a`, and `b` are read, representing the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun under promotion, respectively.

2. **Determine `k`:**
   - `k` is calculated as `min(n, b - a)`. This means Bob will sell the first `k` buns at the modified price, where `k` is at most `n` and at most `b - a`. The reason for `b - a` is that the price of the `i`-th bun under promotion is `(b - i + 1)`, and this value must be non-negative, i.e., `(b - k + 1) >= 0` or `k <= b - a + 1`. Since `k` is zero-based, `k <= b - a`.

3. **Calculate Profit:**
   - If `b <= a`, then selling all buns at the usual price `a` is optimal. The profit is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, Bob sells the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a`. The profit from the first `k` buns is the sum of an arithmetic series: `b + (b - 1) + ... + (b - k + 1)`. This sum can be computed using the formula for the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series: `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2`. The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns is `(n - k) * a`. Therefore, the total profit is `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **First Test Case:** `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
     - `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = 1`
     - Profit = `5 * 1 - 1 * (1 - 1) // 2 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`
   - **Second Test Case:** `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = 5`
     - Profit = `9 * 5 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 45 - 10 = 35`
   - **Third Test Case:** `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
     - `k = min(10, 5 - 10) = 0` (since `b - a` is negative, `k` is 0)
     - Profit = `10 * 10 = 100`
   - **Fourth Test Case:** `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - `k = min(5, 11 - 5) = 5`
     - Profit = `11 * 5 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 55 - 10 = 45`
   - **Fifth Test Case:** `n = 10^9`, `a = 10^9`, `b = 10^9`
     - `k = min(10^9, 10^9 - 10^9) = 0`
     - Profit = `10^9 * 10^9 = 10^18`
   - **Sixth Test Case:** `n = 10^9`, `a = 10^9`, `b = 1`
     - `k = min(10^9, 1 - 10^9) = 0`
     - Profit = `10^9 * 10^9 = 10^18`
   - **Seventh Test Case:** `n = 1000`, `a = 1`, `b = 1000`
     - `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1) = 999`
     - Profit = `1000 * 999 - 999 * 998 // 2 + (1000 - 999) * 1 = 999000 - 498501 + 1 = 500500`

All the test cases match the expected results, confirming that the program is correct.
