To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it processes each test case. The loop processes `t` test cases, and for each test case, it calculates a value based on the input integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Here's a breakdown of the logic inside the loop:
1. **Input Reading**: For each iteration, the loop reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. **Calculation**:
   - It calculates `k = min(n, b - a)`.
   - If `b <= a`, it prints `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates and prints `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.

The output state after all iterations will be a series of printed values, one for each test case.

Since the problem asks for the output state in the specified format, and the output is essentially a series of printed values, we can describe the output state as the concatenation of the results of each test case.

However, since the problem format requires a single output state description, we can describe it as follows:

Output State: **A series of integers, each representing the result of the calculation for one test case.**

This description captures the essence of the output state without specifying the exact values, as those depend on the specific inputs provided during execution.

Thus, the final output state in the required format is:

Output State: **A series of integers, each representing the result of the calculation for one test case.**
