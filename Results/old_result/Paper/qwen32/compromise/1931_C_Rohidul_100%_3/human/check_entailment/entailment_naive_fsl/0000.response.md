Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by identifying the longest contiguous segments of the same value at the beginning and the end of the array. The idea is to minimize the number of elements that need to be changed by leveraging these segments. However, the logic does not handle all cases correctly.

### Potential Issue:

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
To make all elements equal with the least cost, we can choose to make all elements equal to `2` or `1`. For example, changing the array to `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` or `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` would require changing 3 elements, which costs 3 burles. However, we can also make the array `[2, 2, 2, 2, 1]` or `[1, 1, 1, 1, 2]` by changing 2 elements, which costs 2 burles. The optimal solution is to change either the middle `3` to `2` or the middle `3` to `1`.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
The program would output `3` for this case, which is incorrect.

### Why the Program Fails:

The program only considers the longest contiguous segments at the beginning and the end of the array and does not explore other potential segments within the array that could lead to a lower cost. Specifically, it does not handle cases where the optimal solution involves changing elements in the middle of the array.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not handle all cases correctly and fails for the provided test case, the correctness is `False`.
