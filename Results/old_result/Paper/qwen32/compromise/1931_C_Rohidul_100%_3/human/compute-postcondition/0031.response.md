To determine the output of the print statement `print(ans)`, let's break down the given initial state and understand the computation of the variable `ans`.

1. **Initial State Recap:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `a` is a list of integers derived from the input.
   - `le` is the length of the list `a`.
   - `l` is the position right before the first element that is not equal to the previous one, or `le - 1` if all elements are equal.
   - `r` is `l`.
   - `st` is the count of the consecutive equal elements from the start, or `le` if all elements are equal.
   - `end` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list.
   - If `a[0] == a[-1]`, then `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`.
   - Otherwise, `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`.

2. **Computation Steps:**
   - **Length of List (`le`)**: This is simply the number of elements in the list `a`.
   - **Count of Consecutive Equal Elements from Start (`st`)**: This is the number of elements at the beginning of the list that are all the same.
   - **Count of Consecutive Equal Elements from End (`end`)**: This is the number of elements at the end of the list that are all the same.
   - **Determine `ans`**:
     - If the first and last elements of the list are the same (`a[0] == a[-1]`), then `ans` is calculated as `max(0, le - (st + end))`. This means we subtract the sum of the counts of consecutive equal elements from the start and end from the total length of the list and take the maximum of the result and 0.
     - If the first and last elements are different (`a[0] != a[-1]`), then `ans` is calculated as `le - max(st, end)`. This means we subtract the maximum of the counts of consecutive equal elements from the start and end from the total length of the list.

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - The output depends on the specific values of `a[0]`, `a[-1]`, `st`, and `end`.
   - Since the exact list `a` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans` based on the above rules.

Output: **ans (where ans is calculated based on the rules provided: if a[0] == a[-1], then ans is max(0, le - (st + end)); otherwise, ans is le - max(st, end))**
