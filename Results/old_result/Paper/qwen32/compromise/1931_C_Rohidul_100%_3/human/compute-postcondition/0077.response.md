Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is at least 4; `a` is a list of integers where `a[0] == a[1] == a[2] == a[3]`; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is 3; `r` is at least 3; `st` is 4; `end` is 1; If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `le - max(st, end)`**

In this output state, the variable `st` has been incremented by 1, so its value is now 4. All other variables retain their initial values.
