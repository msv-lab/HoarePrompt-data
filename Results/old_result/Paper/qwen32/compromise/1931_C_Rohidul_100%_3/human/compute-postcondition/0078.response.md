To determine the final state of the loop, we need to understand how the loop continues to execute based on the given conditions. The loop increments `l` and `st` as long as `a[l] == a[l + 1]` and `l < r`. This means the loop will continue to run as long as the consecutive elements in the list `a` are the same starting from the first element.

Given the outputs after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the list `a` starts with at least 4 identical elements. The loop will keep running until it encounters an element that is different from the previous one or until `l` is no longer less than `r`.

### Final State Analysis:
- **Initial Conditions**: `l` starts at `0` and `st` starts at `1`.
- **Loop Condition**: `while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`.
- **Loop Body**: `l += 1` and `st += 1`.

The loop will terminate when either:
1. `l` is no longer less than `r`.
2. `a[l]` is not equal to `a[l + 1]`.

Let's consider the worst-case scenario where the list `a` consists of all identical elements. In this case, the loop will run until `l` reaches `r - 1` because `a[l]` will always be equal to `a[l + 1]` until `l` is `r - 1`.

### Final Output State:
- `l` will be `r - 1` (i.e., `n - 2`).
- `st` will be `n - 1` (since we start counting from 1).
- `r` remains `n - 1`.
- `end` remains `1`.
- The value of `ans` will be determined by the condition: If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `le - max(st, end)`.
  - Since `st` is `n - 1` and `end` is `1`, if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `max(0, n - (n - 1 + 1)) = max(0, 0) = 0`.
  - Otherwise, `ans` is `n - max(n - 1, 1) = n - (n - 1) = 1`.

### Conclusion:
The final state of the loop, considering the given conditions, would be:
- `l` is `n - 2`.
- `st` is `n - 1`.
- `r` is `n - 1`.
- `end` is `1`.
- `ans` is `0` if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is `1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the length of the list `a`; `a` is the list of integers; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is `n - 2`; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is `n - 1`; `end` is `1`; `ans` is `0` if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is `1`.**
