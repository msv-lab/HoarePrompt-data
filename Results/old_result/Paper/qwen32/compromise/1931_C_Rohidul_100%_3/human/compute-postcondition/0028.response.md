Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is at least 2; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `a[0] == a[-1]`; `l` is the position right before the first element that is not equal to the previous one, or `le - 1` if all elements are equal; `r` is `l`; `st` is the count of the consecutive equal elements from the start, or `le` if all elements are equal; `end` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list; `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`**
