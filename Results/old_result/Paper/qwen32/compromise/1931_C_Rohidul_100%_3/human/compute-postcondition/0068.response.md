Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the new input integer; `a` is the new list of integers derived from the input; `le` is the length of the new list `a`; `l` is `0`; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is `1`; `end` is `1`; If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `le - max(st, end)`**

Natural Language: The variables `st` and `end` have been updated to `1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
