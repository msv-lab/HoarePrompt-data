The provided code snippet only contains the line `n = int(input())`. This line reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. None of the other variables (`t`, `a`, `le`, `l`, `r`, `st`, `end`, `ans`) are affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the input. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is the position right before the first element that is not equal to the previous one, or `le - 1` if all elements are equal; `r` is `l`; `st` is the count of the consecutive equal elements from the start, or `le` if all elements are equal; `end` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list; if `a[0] == a[-1]`, then `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`; otherwise, `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`**.
