The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Given the initial state, `r` is initially `n - 1`. After the decrement, `r` becomes `n - 2`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `le`, `l`, `st`, and `end`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is at least 2; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input where `a[n - 1] == a[n - 2]`; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is `n - 2`; `r` is `n - 2`; `st` is the count of the consecutive equal elements from the start, or `le` if all elements are equal; `end` is 1.**
