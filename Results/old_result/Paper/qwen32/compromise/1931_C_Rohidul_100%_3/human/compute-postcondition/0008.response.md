The code snippet `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Given that the initial state specifies `l` is 0, after the increment, `l` will be 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be at least 2; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input where `a[0] == a[1]`; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is 1; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 1; `end` is 1**.
