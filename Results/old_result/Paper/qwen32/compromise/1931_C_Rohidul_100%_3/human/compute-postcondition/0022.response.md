The code snippet provided increments the value of the variable `end` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is at least 2
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the input where `a[n - 1] == a[n - 2]` and `a[n - 3] == a[n - 4]`
- `le` is the length of the list `a`
- `l` is `n - 3`
- `r` is `n - 4`
- `st` is the count of the consecutive equal elements from the start, or `le` if all elements are equal
- `end` is 2

After executing `end += 1`, the value of `end` changes from 2 to 3.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is at least 2; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input where `a[n - 1] == a[n - 2]` and `a[n - 3] == a[n - 4]`; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is `n - 3`; `r` is `n - 4`; `st` is the count of the consecutive equal elements from the start, or `le` if all elements are equal; `end` is 3.**
