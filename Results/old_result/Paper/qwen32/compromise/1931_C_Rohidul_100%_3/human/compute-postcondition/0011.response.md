The value of `l` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `l` changes from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be at least 3; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input where `a[0] == a[1]` and `a[1] == a[2]`; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is 2; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 2; `end` is 1**.
