You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice has n books. The 1 -st book contains a_1 pages, the 2 -nd book contains
a_2 pages, \ldots , the n -th book contains a_n pages. Alice does the
following:

  * She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.
  * Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile.

Alice loves reading very much. Help her find the maximum total number of pages
she can read by dividing the books into two piles.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 100
) — the number of books Alice has.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the number of pages in each book.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of pages
Alice can read.

Example

    2
    
    1 1
    
    4
    
    2 3 3 1
    
    5
    
    2 2 3 2 2
    
    2
    
    10 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    2
    4
    5
    13
    5
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can put book number 1 in the first pile, and
book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2
pages.

In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first
pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read
the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the
highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 =
4 pages.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of books. This is followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of pages in each book. The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) indicating the number of test cases.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
        
    #State: The value of `t` remains unchanged as it represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the program reads the number of books `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It then calculates and prints the sum of the maximum value from all but the last integer in the list and the last integer itself. No other variables are changed beyond the loop's iteration counter and the input values read within each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program always considers the maximum number among all books except the last one and adds it to the last book's pages. This is not the correct approach to maximize the total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles and reading the highest number in each pile.

Let's consider a test case:

Input:
```
2
3
1 2 3
3
3 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
5
5
```

Actual Output of the Program:
```
3
5
```

For the first test case, the program considers the maximum number among `1` and `2` (which is `2`) and adds it to `3`, resulting in `5`. However, the correct way to maximize the pages Alice can read is to divide the books into two piles such that the highest numbers in each pile are added together. For instance, one optimal division is `[1, 3]` and `[2]`, resulting in `3 + 2 = 5`. Another optimal division is `[1, 2]` and `[3]`, resulting in `2 + 3 = 5`.

For the second test case, the program considers the maximum number among `3` and `2` (which is `3`) and adds it to `1`, resulting in `4`. However, the correct way to maximize the pages Alice can read is to divide the books into two piles such that the highest numbers in each pile are added together. For instance, one optimal division is `[3, 1]` and `[2]`, resulting in `3 + 2 = 5`. Another optimal division is `[3, 2]` and `[1]`, resulting in `3 + 2 = 5`.

The program does not handle the problem correctly and fails to find the optimal division of books into two piles to maximize the total number of pages Alice can read. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
