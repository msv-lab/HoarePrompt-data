Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of books and a list of `n` integers representing the number of pages in each book. For each test case, it calculates and prints the sum of the maximum number of pages from the first `n-1` books and the number of pages in the last book.**
