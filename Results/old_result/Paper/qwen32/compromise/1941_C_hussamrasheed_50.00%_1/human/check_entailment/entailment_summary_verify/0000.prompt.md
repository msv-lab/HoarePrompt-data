You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Example

Input

    6
    
    9
    
    mmapnapie
    
    9
    
    azabazapi
    
    8
    
    mappppie
    
    18
    
    mapmapmapmapmapmap
    
    1
    
    p
    
    11
    
    pppiepieeee

Output

    2
    0
    2
    6
    0
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        m = s.count('map')
        s = s.replace('map', '')
        p = s.count('pie')
        print(m + p)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of a string `s` of length `n`. For each test case, it counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'map' in `s`, removes all occurrences of 'map' from `s`, and then counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the modified string. It prints the sum of these two counts for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem because it only counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and sums them up to determine the minimum number of deletions required. However, simply counting the occurrences of these substrings does not account for overlapping substrings or the optimal way to remove characters to avoid these substrings.

For example, consider the input string "ppiepiepie". The program would count three occurrences of "pie" and output 3, but the actual minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful is 2 (by removing two 'p's).

Here is a counterexample:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  11
  ppiepiepie
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```
- Actual Output from the program:
  ```
  3
  ```

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases correctly.
