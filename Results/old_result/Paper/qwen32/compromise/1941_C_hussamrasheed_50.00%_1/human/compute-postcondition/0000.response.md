Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**

In simple terms, `t` has been assigned the value of an integer input, and the conditions for the subsequent test cases remain unchanged.
