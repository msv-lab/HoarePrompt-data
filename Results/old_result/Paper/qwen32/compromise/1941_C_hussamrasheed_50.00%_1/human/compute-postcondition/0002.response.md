Output State: **t test cases have been processed, where for each test case, the number of occurrences of the substring 'map' followed by the number of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the modified string (after removing all occurrences of 'map') have been printed. The variables `n`, `s`, `m`, and `p` are no longer in their initial state and their final values depend on the last test case processed. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it represents the number of test cases.**
