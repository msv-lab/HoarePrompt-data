Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting a new input string on whitespace.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
   - `k` is initialized to 0.
   - `k0` is the integer value of `k` (which is 0).
   - `i` is the last value from `arr` (which could be 2 or 3 depending on the exact number of iterations).
   - `arr` is a list containing the integers [2, 3].
   - `ans` is a list containing the integers [8, 8, 4, -20].
   - `c` is set to `n`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will unpack the list `ans` and print each of its elements separated by a space.

3. **Values of Variables**:
   - `ans` is explicitly provided as [8, 8, 4, -20].

4. **Output**:
   - The print statement will print each element of the `ans` list separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **8 8 4 -20**
