The code snippet `ans.append(1 << i)` appends the result of `1 << i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 2, `1 << i` is equivalent to `1 << 2`, which is 4. Therefore, the value 4 is appended to the list `ans`.

The initial state specifies that `ans` remains an empty list if `c` was not previously `n - 1`. Since the problem does not indicate that `c` was previously `n - 1`, we assume `ans` was initially an empty list. After appending 4 to `ans`, `ans` becomes `[4]`.

Other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, `arr`, `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 1; `i` is 2; `arr` is [0]; `c` is `n`; `ans` is [4]**.
