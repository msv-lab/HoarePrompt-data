Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 0; `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`; `arr` is a list containing at least one element; `ans` is [0] if `c` is equal to `n - 1`, otherwise `ans` remains an empty list; `c` is either `n - 1` (if the condition was met and we broke out of the loop or statement) or retains its original value (if the condition was not met).**
