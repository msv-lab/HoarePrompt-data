The code snippet `ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))` appends a list of zeros to `ans` such that the final length of `ans` is equal to `n`. Given the initial state, `ans` is a list of length `n` with the values `[4, 4, ..., 4, 1 - 4*(n-1)]`. Therefore, the length of `ans` is already `n`, and the expression `(n - len(ans))` evaluates to `0`. Consequently, no zeros are appended to `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 1; `i` is 2; `arr` is [0, 2, ..., 2*(n-1)]; `c` is `n`; `ans` is [4, 4, ..., 4, 1 - 4*(n-1)]**.
