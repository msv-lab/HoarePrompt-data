The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable iterating over `arr`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` for the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`
- `k` is 0
- `k0` is 0
- `i` is the second element of `arr`
- `arr` is a list containing at least one element
- `ans` is either `[0, 1, k0 - 1, 1 << i]` if `c` was `n - 1` initially, otherwise `ans` is `[1, k0 - 1, 1 << i]`
- `c` is `n` if it was `n - 1` initially, otherwise `c` is its original value plus 1

The loop iterates over `arr`, so for the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in `arr`.

Let's denote the current index of `i` in `arr` as `index`. Since `i` is the second element of `arr` at the end of the previous iteration, `index` is 1. For the next iteration, `index` should be 2, and `i` should be the third element of `arr`.

However, we do not have the specific elements of `arr` or its length, but we know that `arr` has at least one element, and `i` is currently the second element. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least three elements, and `i` should be the third element of `arr`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is 0, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `arr` is a list containing at least three elements, `ans` is either `[0, 1, k0 - 1, 1 << i]` if `c` was `n - 1` initially, otherwise `ans` is `[1, k0 - 1, 1 << i]`, `c` is `n` if it was `n - 1` initially, otherwise `c` is its original value plus 1**
