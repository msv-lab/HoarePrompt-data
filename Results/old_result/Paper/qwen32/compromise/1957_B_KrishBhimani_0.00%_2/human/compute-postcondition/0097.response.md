The code snippet `n, k = list(map(int, l1))` takes the first two elements of the list `l1`, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. 

Given that `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace, and `n` is already defined as the integer value of the first element of `l1`, the value of `n` will not change. The variable `k` will be assigned the integer value of the second element of `l1`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `k0` is the integer value of `k`; `i` is the last value from `arr` (which could be 2 or 3 depending on the exact number of iterations); `arr` is [2, 3]; `ans` is [8, 8, 4, -20]; `c` is `n`.**
