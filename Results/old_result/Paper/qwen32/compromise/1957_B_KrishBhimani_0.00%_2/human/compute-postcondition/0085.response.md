The code snippet appends the value of `1 << i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 3, `1 << i` is equivalent to `1 << 3`, which is `8`. Therefore, `8` is appended to the list `ans`.

Since `c` is `n + 1` and the condition `c == n` is not met (as `c` is always `n + 1` and not `n`), the list `ans` remains either `[8]` or `[0, 8]` before the append operation. After appending `8`, `ans` becomes `[8, 8]` or `[0, 8, 8]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is the integer value of `k`; `i` is 3; `arr` is [2, 3]; `c` is `n + 1`; `ans` is either [8, 8] or [0, 8, 8]**.
