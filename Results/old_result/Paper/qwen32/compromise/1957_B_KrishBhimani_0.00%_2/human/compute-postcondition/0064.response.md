The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is `k // 2`; `i` is 2; `arr` is [1] if `k` is odd, otherwise `arr` remains []; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros; `c` is 0.
