### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to construct a permutation `p` based on the provided array `a` and the definition of MEX (Minimum EXcluded value). However, there are some issues with the logic used in the program that need to be addressed.

Let's break down the problem and the program step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the problem**:
   - We need to construct a permutation `p` such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Approach**:
   - The program initializes `p` with `-1` and `mex` with `n`.
   - It then iterates from the end of `a` to the beginning, calculating `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - The `mex` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.

3. **Issues in the program**:
   - The logic for updating `mex` is incorrect. The `mex` should be recalculated based on the elements that have been added to `p` so far, not just the last calculated `p[i]`.
   - The initial value of `mex` should be `0`, not `n`, because the smallest possible MEX for an empty array is `0`.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Use a set to keep track of the elements that have been added to `p`.
   - Iterate through `a` and for each `a[i]`, find the current MEX by checking which is the smallest non-negative integer not in the set.
   - Calculate `p[i]` as `MEX - a[i]` and add `p[i]` to the set.
   - Continue this process until the permutation `p` is fully constructed.

### Correctness:

Given the issues in the provided program, the current implementation does not correctly construct the permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**

### Correct Implementation (for reference):

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = []
        used = set()
        
        for i in range(n):
            mex = 0
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
            p.append(mex - a[i])
            used.add(p[-1])
        
        print(*p)

# This implementation correctly constructs the permutation `p` based on the given array `a`.
```

This corrected implementation ensures that the MEX is recalculated correctly at each step and that the permutation `p` satisfies the given conditions.
