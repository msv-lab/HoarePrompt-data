Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation `p` based on the array `a`. The core issue lies in the assumption that the MEX value can be determined by always taking the minimum of the current `mex` and the calculated `p[i]`. This approach does not guarantee that the constructed `p` will be a valid permutation (i.e., each integer from 0 to n-1 appears exactly once).

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5
3 1 -2 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
One valid permutation `p` could be `0 1 4 2 3`, resulting in `a` as `3 1 -2 1 2` as shown in the problem description.

**Program Output:**
The provided program will produce `4 2 0 1 -1`, which is incorrect because:
1. The value `-1` is not a valid element for `p` since `p` should only contain values from 0 to n-1.
2. The value `4` appears at the beginning, but it should be `0` based on the MEX calculation.
3. The constructed `p` does not form a valid permutation of `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.

The program needs to ensure that each element in `p` is unique and within the range `[0, n-1]`. The current approach does not guarantee this, which leads to incorrect results in some cases.
