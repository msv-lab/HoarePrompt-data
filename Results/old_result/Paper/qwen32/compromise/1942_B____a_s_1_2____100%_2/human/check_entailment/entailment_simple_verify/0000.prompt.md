You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        print(*p)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data.

    t = int(input())

        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = [-1] * n
        
        mex = n
        
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        
        print(*p)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `t` will be 0, and for each test case, `p` will be a list of integers where each element `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]` from the end of the list `a` to the beginning, with `mex` being updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]` at each step. The final `mex` represents the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `p`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation `p` based on the array `a`. The core issue lies in the assumption that the MEX value can be determined by always taking the minimum of the current `mex` and the calculated `p[i]`. This approach does not guarantee that the constructed `p` will be a valid permutation (i.e., each integer from 0 to n-1 appears exactly once).

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5
3 1 -2 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
One valid permutation `p` could be `0 1 4 2 3`, resulting in `a` as `3 1 -2 1 2` as shown in the problem description.

**Program Output:**
The provided program will produce `4 2 0 1 -1`, which is incorrect because:
1. The value `-1` is not a valid element for `p` since `p` should only contain values from 0 to n-1.
2. The value `4` appears at the beginning, but it should be `0` based on the MEX calculation.
3. The constructed `p` does not form a valid permutation of `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.

The program needs to ensure that each element in `p` is unique and within the range `[0, n-1]`. The current approach does not guarantee this, which leads to incorrect results in some cases.
