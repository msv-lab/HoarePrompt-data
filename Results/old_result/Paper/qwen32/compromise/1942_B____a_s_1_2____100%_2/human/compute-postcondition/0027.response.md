The given code snippet updates the value of `mex` by taking the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `p`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` and all other elements remain `-1`; `mex` is the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`; `i` is decremented by 1**.

In natural language: The value of `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. All other variables retain their previous values.
