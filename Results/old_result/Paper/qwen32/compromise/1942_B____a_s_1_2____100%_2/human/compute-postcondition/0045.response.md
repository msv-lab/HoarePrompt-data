The code snippet updates the element at index `i` of the list `p` to the value of `mex - a[i]`. 

Given the initial state, `i` is `n - 1`, so the element at the last index of `p` is updated. The value `mex` is the minimum of `n`, `n - a[0]`, and `p[0]`. After updating `p[i]`, the value of `mex` does not change because `mex` is calculated before this update and is not recalculated after it.

The updated list `p` will have its last element set to `mex - a[n-1]`, while all other elements remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers with `p[0]` updated to `mex - a[0]`, `p[n-1]` updated to `mex - a[n-1]`, and all other elements initialized to -1; `mex` is the minimum of `n`, `n - a[0]`, and `p[0]`; `i` is n - 1**.
