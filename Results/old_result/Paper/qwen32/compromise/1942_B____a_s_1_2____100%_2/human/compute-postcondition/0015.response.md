Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where the i-th element is `mex - a[i]` for all i from 0 to n-1; `mex` is the minimum value of `n` and all `p[i]` values computed during the loop iterations.`**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, the list `p` will have been updated such that each element `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`. The variable `mex` will have been adjusted to be the smallest value between its initial value (`n`) and any of the values computed for `p[i]` during the loop. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
