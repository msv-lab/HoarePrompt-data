The code snippet `p[i] = mex - a[i]` updates the `i`-th element of the list `p` to be `mex - a[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n - 2`, and `mex` is defined as the minimum of `n` and `n - a[i]`.

Let's break down the changes:
- `p[i]` is updated to `mex - a[i]`.
- `mex` is either `n` or `n - a[i]`, whichever is smaller.

After the execution of the code snippet, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where the `i`-th element is updated to `mex - a[i]` (previously it was `mex - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`); `mex` is the minimum of `n` and `n - a[i]`; `i` is `n - 2`.**
