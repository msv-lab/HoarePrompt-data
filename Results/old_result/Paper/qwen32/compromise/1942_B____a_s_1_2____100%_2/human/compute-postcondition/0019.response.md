The code snippet provided reassigns the variable `a` to a new list of integers obtained from the input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, and `mex`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where the i-th element is `mex - a[i]` for all i from 0 to n-1; `mex` is the minimum value of `n` and all `p[i]` values computed during the loop iterations.**
