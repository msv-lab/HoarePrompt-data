The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i`.

Given:
- The loop iterates in reverse order, starting from `i = n - 1` and decrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, and the loop will execute again if `i` is still greater than or equal to `0`.

Let's determine the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration:
- If `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k - 1`.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

Since the loop is iterating in reverse, the state at the start of the next iteration will have `i` decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers with `p[i]` updated to `n - a[i]` and all other elements initialized to -1; `mex` is the minimum of `n` and `p[i]`; `i` is decremented by 1**.

To be more specific:
- If `i` was `n - 1` at the end of the first iteration, then at the start of the second iteration, `i` will be `n - 2`.
- This pattern continues until `i` reaches `0`.

So, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers with `p[i]` updated to `n - a[i]` and all other elements initialized to -1; `mex` is the minimum of `n` and `p[i]`; `i` is `i - 1`**.

Given the loop condition, if `i` was `0` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop would not execute again. Therefore, `i` must be greater than `0` at the start of the next iteration.

If we assume `i` was `1` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `0`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers with `p[i]` updated to `n - a[i]` and all other elements initialized to -1; `mex` is the minimum of `n` and `p[i]`; `i` is `0`**.

However, to generalize, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers with `p[i]` updated to `n - a[i]` and all other elements initialized to -1; `mex` is the minimum of `n` and `p[i]`; `i` is `i - 1`**.

Since we need to specify a concrete state, let's assume `i` was `1` at the end of the previous iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `0`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers with `p[i]` updated to `n - a[i]` and all other elements initialized to -1; `mex` is the minimum of `n` and `p[i]`; `i` is 0**.
