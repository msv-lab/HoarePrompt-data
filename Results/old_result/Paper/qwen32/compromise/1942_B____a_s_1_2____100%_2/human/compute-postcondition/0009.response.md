The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. Therefore, to adjust the state for the next iteration of the loop, we need to decrement `i` by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `p` is a list of integers where the `i`-th element is `mex - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`
- `mex` is the minimum of `n` and `n - a[i]`
- `i` is the loop variable, and at the end of the previous iteration, it was some value `j` (where `j` is between `n - 1` and `0`)

At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `j - 1`. Since we do not know the exact value of `j` from the given state, we can express the state in terms of the next value of `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where the `i`-th element is `mex - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`; `mex` is the minimum of `n` and `n - a[i]`; `i` is `i - 1`**.

However, to be more precise, if `i` was `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n - 2`. If `i` was `n - 2` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n - 3`, and so on.

Since we are asked to adjust the state for the next iteration and we know the loop decrements `i` by 1 each time, we can say:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where the `i`-th element is `mex - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`; `mex` is the minimum of `n` and `n - a[i]`; `i` is `i - 1`**

But to be explicit about the next value, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k - 1`.

Since we do not have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can generalize:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where the `i`-th element is `mex - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`; `mex` is the minimum of `n` and `n - a[i]`; `i` is `i - 1`**

If we assume `i` was `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, then:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where the `i`-th element is `mex - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`; `mex` is the minimum of `n` and `n - a[i]`; `i` is `n - 2`**

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where the `i`-th element is `mex - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`; `mex` is the minimum of `n` and `n - a[i]`; `i` is `i - 1`**

If we need a specific example, assuming `i` was `n - 1`:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where the `i`-th element is `mex - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`; `mex` is the minimum of `n` and `n - a[i]`; `i` is `n - 2`**
