The code snippet updates the value of `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`. Given that `i` is 0, `p[0]` is updated. The value of `mex` is the minimum of `n` and any `p[i]`, but since `p[i]` is initialized to `-1` for all elements except `p[0]` which is `n - a[0]`, `mex` is initially the minimum of `n` and `n - a[0]`. After the update, `mex` needs to be recalculated as the minimum of `n`, `n - a[0]`, and the new value of `p[0]` which is `mex - a[0]`.

However, the problem simplifies because `mex` is initially `n - a[0]` or `n`, whichever is smaller. After the update, `p[0]` becomes `mex - a[0]`, and since `mex` is at most `n`, `p[0]` will be at most `n - a[0]`. The new `mex` will be the minimum of `n`, `n - a[0]`, and `mex - a[0]`. Since `mex` is initially `n - a[0]` or `n`, and `p[0]` is updated to `mex - a[0]`, the new `mex` will be `mex - a[0]` if `mex - a[0]` is smaller than `n - a[0]` or `n`.

Given the initial state and the update, the new `p[0]` will be `mex - a[0]`, and `mex` will be recalculated. However, since the problem does not specify further changes or recalculations of `mex` beyond the initial state, we can assume that the new `mex` is `mex - a[0]` if it is smaller than the previous `mex`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers with `p[0]` updated to `mex - a[0]` and all other elements initialized to -1; `mex` is the minimum of `n`, `n - a[0]`, and `mex - a[0]`; `i` is 0**.
