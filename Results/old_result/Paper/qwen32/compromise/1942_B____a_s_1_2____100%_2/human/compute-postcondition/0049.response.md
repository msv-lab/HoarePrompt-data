Output State: **After all iterations, `t` will be 0, and for each test case, `p` will be a list of integers where each element `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]` from the end of the list `a` to the beginning, with `mex` being updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]` at each step. The final `mex` represents the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `p`.**

In simpler terms, after all the test cases have been processed, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop has run for all the specified test cases. For each test case, the list `p` will contain values calculated by subtracting each element of the input list `a` from `mex`, starting from the end of `a` to the beginning. The value of `mex` is adjusted to be the smallest value between its current state and the newly calculated `p[i]` at each step. The final `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the list `p`.
