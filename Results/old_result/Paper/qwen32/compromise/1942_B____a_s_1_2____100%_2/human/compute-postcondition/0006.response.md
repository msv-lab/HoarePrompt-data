The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. Specifically, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 because the range function `range(n - 1, -1, -1)` will produce at least one value (which is `n-1`) if `n` is 1 or greater.

The variable `t` is not part of the loop head and does not affect the execution of the loop. Similarly, the lists `a`, `p`, and the variable `mex` are not part of the loop head and do not affect whether the loop can execute.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least 1. The initial value of `i` does not need to be set before the loop starts because `i` is initialized by the `range` function in the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers with `-1` repeated `n` times; `mex` is equal to `n`**
