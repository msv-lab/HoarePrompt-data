The code snippet assigns a list of `-1` values to the variable `p` with a length of `n`. The other variables, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `mex`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of `-1` with length `n`; `mex` is the minimum value of `n` and all `p[i]` values computed during the loop iterations.**
