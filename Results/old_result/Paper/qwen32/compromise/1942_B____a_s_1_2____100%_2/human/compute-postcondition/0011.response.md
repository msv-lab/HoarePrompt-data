The code snippet `mex = min(mex, p[i])` updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `mex` is already defined as the minimum of `n` and `n - a[i]`, and `p[i]` is defined as `mex - a[i]`, the new value of `mex` will be the minimum of these two values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where the `i`-th element is updated to `mex - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`; `mex` is the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`; `i` is `n - 2`.**
