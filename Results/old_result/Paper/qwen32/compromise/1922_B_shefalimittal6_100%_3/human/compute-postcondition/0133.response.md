Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It calculates a value based on the frequency of each integer in the list and the combinations of these frequencies. The function outputs a single integer for each test case, representing the calculated value.**
