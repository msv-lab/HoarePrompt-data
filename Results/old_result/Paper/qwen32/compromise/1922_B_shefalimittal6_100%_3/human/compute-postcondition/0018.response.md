The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` which is not explicitly used within the loop body, and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `n`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, it does not need to be adjusted.

At the end of the last iteration, `idx` is `idx + 1`, meaning `idx` has been incremented by 1. The loop will execute as long as the loop variable `_` is less than `n`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop condition, we only need to ensure that `n` remains greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Since the loop variable `_` is not directly tied to any of the other variables (`t`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `idx`, `results`, `v`, `x`), we do not need to adjust any of these variables for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same with respect to the loop head variable `n`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `idx` is `idx + 1`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` which is 2, `x` is `int(data[idx])`**
