Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` elements, `idx` is `idx + n`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[i]`, `i` is 2. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is updated to `ans + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
