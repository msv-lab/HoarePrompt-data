To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it updates the variables over time.

### Loop Breakdown:
- **Initialization:**
  - `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
  - `idx` is incremented by `n + 1` initially.
  - `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v` (which is 0 initially).
  - `ans` is the sum of all contributions from the combinations formula based on the values in `v` (which is 0 initially).
  - `results` is updated to include `str(ans)` at the end.

- **Loop Execution:**
  - For each iteration, `x = int(data[idx])` is read.
  - `idx` is incremented by 1.
  - `v[x]` is incremented by 1.
  - `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`.
  - `ans` is updated based on the combinations formula.
  - `results` is updated to include `str(ans)` at the end.

### Observations:
- The loop runs `n` times.
- After each iteration, `v[x]` is incremented by 1.
- `idx` is incremented by `n + 1` initially and then by 1 in each iteration, so after `n` iterations, `idx` will be `idx + n + 1 + n = idx + 2n + 1`.
- `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, which will be `n` after `n` iterations because each `v[x]` is incremented exactly once.
- `ans` is updated based on the combinations formula, but the exact formula is not provided. However, it is clear that `ans` will be calculated based on the final state of `v`.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results` remain the same.
- `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except for the elements that have been incremented by the values in `data` (each incremented exactly once).
- `idx` is `idx + 2n + 1`.
- `cnt` is `n` (since each `v[x]` is incremented exactly once).
- `ans` is the sum of all contributions from the combinations formula based on the final values in `v`.
- `results` now includes `str(ans)` at the end.

### Conclusion:
The output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is the integer value at `data[idx]`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` which is incremented based on the values in `data`, `idx` is `idx + 2n + 1`, `cnt` is `n`, `ans` is the sum of all contributions from the combinations formula based on the final values in `v`, `results` now includes `str(ans)` at the end.**

In simple terms, after the loop completes, `v` will have counts of each value from `data` that was processed, `idx` will have moved forward by `2n + 1` positions, `cnt` will be equal to `n`, `ans` will be calculated based on the final `v`, and `results` will include the final `ans`.
