The code snippet provided increments the value of `idx` by 1. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results`, `v`, `cnt`, `ans`) are modified by this code.

Given the initial state, the only change is the increment of `idx`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is the integer value at `data[idx]`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element at index `x` is incremented by the number of occurrences of `x` in `data`, `idx` is `idx + n + 1`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `ans` is the sum of all contributions from the combinations formula based on the values in `v`, `results` now includes `str(ans)` at the end.**

In simpler terms, the only change is that `idx` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
