The given code snippet is:

```
cnt += v[i]
```

This line increments the variable `cnt` by the value of `v[i]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the given code.

Given the initial state, the only variable that is affected by this line is `cnt`. Therefore, `cnt` will be updated to its previous value plus `v[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is the integer value at `data[idx]` and is at least 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` which is incremented based on the values in `data`, `idx` is `idx + 2n + 1`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[i]`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is updated to `ans + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. `results` now includes `str(ans)` at the end.**
