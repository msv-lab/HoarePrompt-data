Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element at index `x` (where `x` is an integer from `data` corresponding to the current iteration) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `x` in `data`, `idx` is `idx + n`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `v` will reflect the count of each integer from `data` that was processed. Each element in `v` at index `x` will be equal to the number of times `x` appears in the first `n` elements of `data` starting from the initial `idx`. The index `idx` will have been incremented by `n` to account for all the elements processed in the loop. All other variables (`t`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `results`) will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
