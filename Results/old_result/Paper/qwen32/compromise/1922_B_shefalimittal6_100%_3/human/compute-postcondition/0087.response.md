Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is the integer value at `data[idx]`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` which is incremented based on the values in `data`, `idx` is `idx + 2n + 1`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `ans` is the accumulated sum of combinations based on the conditions in the loop body, `results` now includes `str(ans)` at the end.**

Explanation: The code appends the string representation of `ans` to the `results` list. All other variables retain their previous values and states as described in the initial state.
