The line of code `x = int(data[idx])` updates the value of `x` based on the integer conversion of the element at the position `idx` in the `data` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `idx` is `idx + 1` from the initial state, the value of `data[idx]` is converted to an integer and assigned to `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `idx` is `idx + 1`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` which is incremented by 1, `x` is `int(data[idx])`.**
