The code snippet `v[x] += 1` increments the value at the index `x` of the list `v` by 1. Given that `v` is initially a list of `n + 1` zeros, after this operation, the element at index `x` will be 1 (if it was 0 before) or incremented by 1 if it had a different value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `idx` is `idx + 1`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` which is incremented by 1, `x` is `int(data[idx])`.**
