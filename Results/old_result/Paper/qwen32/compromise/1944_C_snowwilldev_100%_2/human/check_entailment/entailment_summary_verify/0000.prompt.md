You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` and a list of `N` integers from the input. It then determines and returns the smallest integer `i` such that either the integer `i` does not appear in the list, or `i` appears exactly once in the list and there are already at least two other integers that each appear exactly once.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob to achieve the game's score as defined by the MEX of the array `c`. The program incorrectly assumes that the game's score is determined by the first index `i` where the count of `i` in `a` is either 1 or 0, which does not align with the strategic interaction between Alice and Bob.

Let's analyze the program's logic and identify a potential issue:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a` itself.
2. It counts the occurrences of each number in `a` using a dictionary `cnt`.
3. It then iterates through the possible values from 0 to N, checking if the count of the current value is 1 or 0. If so, it returns the current value as the MEX.

However, the program does not account for the strategic moves of Alice and Bob:
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she should aim to include as many unique elements as possible in `c`.
- Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he should aim to prevent Alice from including unique elements.

The program's current logic does not simulate this strategic interaction. Instead, it simply finds the first number with a count of 1 or 0, which does not consider the optimal moves by both players.

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Explanation of the Correct Output:**
- Alice can pick any number, say 0.
- Bob can pick any number, say 1.
- Alice can pick the next number, say 2.
- Bob can pick the next number, say 3.
- Alice can pick the last number, 4.
- The final array `c` is `[0, 2, 4]` (or any permutation), and the MEX is 1.

The program, however, would return 0 because the count of 0 is 1, which is incorrect based on the optimal play described.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not simulate the strategic interaction between Alice and Bob correctly.
