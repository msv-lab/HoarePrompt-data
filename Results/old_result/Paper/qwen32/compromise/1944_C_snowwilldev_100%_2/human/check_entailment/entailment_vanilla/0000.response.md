Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to see if it meets the requirements and correctly calculates the MEX score under optimal play by Alice and Bob.

### Problem Understanding
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a` and removing them.
- Alice tries to maximize the MEX of the final array `c`.
- Bob tries to minimize the MEX of the final array `c`.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Strategy Analysis
- Alice and Bob play optimally. Alice will try to introduce elements that increase the MEX, while Bob will try to prevent this.
- The key insight is that the MEX of `c` will be determined by the smallest non-negative integer that is not included in `c` after all elements are moved from `a` to `c`.
- If an integer `i` appears exactly once in `a`, it can be strategically placed by Alice to ensure that the MEX is at least `i+1` (by placing it at the end of her turns).
- If any integer appears more than once, Bob can prevent it from contributing to the MEX by pairing it with another occurrence, ensuring that the MEX is less than or equal to the first integer that appears only once or is missing.

### Solution Breakdown
- The solution uses a `defaultdict` to count occurrences of each integer in `a`.
- It then iterates through integers from `0` to `N` (inclusive) to find the first integer that either appears zero times or appears exactly once.
- The first integer that meets this condition is returned as the MEX.

### Correctness Verification
- The logic correctly identifies the smallest integer that either does not appear in `a` or appears exactly once, which aligns with the optimal strategy for both players.
- The solution handles all edge cases, including:
  - Arrays where all elements are the same.
  - Arrays where elements are unique.
  - Arrays with a mix of unique and repeated elements.

### Conclusion
The provided solution correctly calculates the MEX score under optimal play by both Alice and Bob.

Reasoning: The solution correctly identifies the smallest integer that either does not appear in the array or appears exactly once, which determines the MEX score under optimal play by both players.

Correctness: **True**
