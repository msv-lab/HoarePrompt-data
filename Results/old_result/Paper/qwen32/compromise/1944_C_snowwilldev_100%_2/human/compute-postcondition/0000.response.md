The code snippet provided reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `N`. This affects the variable `N` but does not alter the array `a` or its properties as described in the initial state. 

Output State: **Each test case contains an integer `N` (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array `a`. The array `a` contains `N` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_N` (0 ≤ `a_i` < `N`). The sum of `N` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `N` is assigned the value of the input integer.**
