### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of finding an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. However, the logic in the program does not correctly achieve this goal. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Handling of `X == 2`**: The program correctly handles the case when `X` is 2 by printing an array of length 1 with a single element (e.g., `[0]`). This is because an array of length 1 has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing the single element.

2. **General Case Handling**:
   - The program attempts to decompose `X` into a sum of powers of 2. This is done in the while loop where it finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `X` and subtracts it from `X`, appending the exponent to `subseq_lens`.
   - The idea seems to be to use the binary representation of `X` to determine the structure of the array. However, the way the array `ansv` is constructed does not guarantee that the number of increasing subsequences will be exactly `X`.
   - Specifically, the array `ansv` is constructed by appending elements from `subseq_lens` starting from the second element, and the initial part of `ansv` is filled with a sequence of increasing integers from 0 to `mx-1`, where `mx` is the maximum exponent found in the decomposition.
   - This construction does not ensure that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The number of increasing subsequences of an array is influenced by the specific values and order of the elements, and the current logic does not account for this properly.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the length of `ansv` and then the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces. This part of the program is correct in terms of format, assuming `ansv` were correctly constructed to meet the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly construct the array to ensure it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences for all possible values of `X`. The logic for decomposing `X` into powers of 2 and constructing the array `ansv` does not guarantee the correct number of increasing subsequences.
