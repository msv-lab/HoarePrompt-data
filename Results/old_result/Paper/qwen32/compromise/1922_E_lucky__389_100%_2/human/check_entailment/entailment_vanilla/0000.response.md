Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. The program needs to handle multiple test cases and output either an array that satisfies the condition or -1 if no such array exists.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the value of \( X \). The goal is to construct an array that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.

#### Key Points:
1. **Special Case for \( X = 2 \)**:
   - The program correctly handles this case by outputting an array of length 1 with a single element (0), which indeed has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing the single element.

2. **General Case for \( X > 2 \)**:
   - The program attempts to decompose \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2. This is based on the observation that if an array has elements that are strictly increasing in some positions and equal in others, the number of increasing subsequences can be related to the binary representation of \( X \).
   - For each power of 2 that fits into \( X \), the program subtracts that power from \( X \) and records the exponent.
   - It then constructs an array based on the exponents found. The array is constructed such that it has the required number of increasing subsequences.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Array Construction**:
  - The array construction logic is flawed. The program simply appends the exponents found to the array, but this does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
  - The approach should be more systematic in constructing the array to ensure the correct number of increasing subsequences. For example, using repeated elements and ensuring that the subsequences are counted correctly.

- **Handling of Edge Cases**:
  - The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, it does not ensure that the array length does not exceed 200.
  - The program should verify that the constructed array meets the problem's constraints and requirements.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the array construction logic and the lack of verification of constraints, the program is not guaranteed to produce a correct solution for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **False**
