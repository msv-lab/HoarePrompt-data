Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is an integer; `subseq_lens` is an empty list; `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `i - 1` if `i` is not 0; `i` is the smallest integer such that 2, and if `i` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
