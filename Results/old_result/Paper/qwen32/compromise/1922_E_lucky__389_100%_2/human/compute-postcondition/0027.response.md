The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was initially 0, it is now 1. The values of `t`, `X`, `x`, `subseq_lens`, and `mx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is any non-zero integer and `x` must be at least 1; `subseq_lens` is an empty list; `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `i - 1` if `i` is not 0; `i` is 1**
