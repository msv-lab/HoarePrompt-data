The code `x -= 2 ** (i - 1)` subtracts the highest power of 2 less than `x` from `x`. Given the initial state, `i` is the smallest integer such that `2^i` is greater than `x`, and `i` is not equal to 0. Therefore, `2^(i-1)` is the highest power of 2 less than `x`.

After the operation, the value of `x` will be reduced by `2^(i-1)`. The other variables (`t`, `X`, `subseq_lens`, `mx`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is any non-zero integer minus the highest power of 2 less than `x`; `subseq_lens` is a list containing `i - 1`; `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `x`; `i` is the smallest integer such that `2^i` is greater than `x`, and `i` is not equal to 0.**
