Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is any non-zero integer; `subseq_lens` is either an empty list or a list containing `i - 1`; `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `x` or `i - 1`; `i` is 0.**

Natural language: The value of `i` has been set to 0. All other variables (`t`, `X`, `x`, `subseq_lens`, and `mx`) retain their previous values and constraints.
