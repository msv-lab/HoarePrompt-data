The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop condition is `i <= 1000`, and right before the loop, `i` is 1.

Since `i` is currently 1, which is less than or equal to 1000, the loop can certainly execute. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, `i` is 1**
