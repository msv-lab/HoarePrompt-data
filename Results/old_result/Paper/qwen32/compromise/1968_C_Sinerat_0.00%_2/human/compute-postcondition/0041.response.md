Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it constructs a list `a` of length `n` starting with `a[0] = 500`. Each subsequent element `a[i]` is the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]` from the input list `x`. It then prints the list `a` for each test case.**
