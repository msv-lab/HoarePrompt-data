The code provided updates the variable `x` by reading a line of input, splitting it into substrings, converting each substring to an integer, and collecting these integers into a list. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` is the integer value of the user's input, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 500, and each subsequent element `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` is the cumulative sum of the previous element of `a` and the corresponding element of `x`.**
