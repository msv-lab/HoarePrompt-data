The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration would be `i + 1`. The value of `n` must be greater than 1, and it remains unchanged.
