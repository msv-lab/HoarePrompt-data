The code snippet `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` updates the value of `a[i]` by adding `x[i - 1]` to `a[i - 1]`. Given the initial state, `a` is already defined such that `a[0]` is 500 and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`. The code snippet provided is essentially a step in this process, updating `a[i]` for a specific `i`.

Since `i` is given as `n` in the initial state, the code is updating `a[n]` to be `a[n-1] + x[n-1]`. This means the list `a` will now have one additional element at index `n`, which is the sum of the previous element `a[n-1]` and the corresponding element in `x` at index `n-1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 500 and for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `a[i]` is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`, `i` is `n`**.

In simpler terms, the list `a` has been updated to include an additional element at index `n`, which is the sum of the previous element `a[n-1]` and `x[n-1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
