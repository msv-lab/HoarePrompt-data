To determine the final output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop updates the list `a`. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, and during each iteration, it updates the `i-th` element of `a` to be the sum of the `(i-1)-th` element of `a` and the `(i-1)-th` element of `x`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
   - `n` is the integer input by the user.
   - `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `a` is a list of length `n` with the first element set to 500 and the rest initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For `i = 1`, `a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 500 + x[0]`.
   - For `i = 2`, `a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = (500 + x[0]) + x[1]`.
   - For `i = 3`, `a[3] = a[2] + x[2] = ((500 + x[0]) + x[1]) + x[2]`.
   - This pattern continues until `i = n-1`, where `a[n-1] = a[n-2] + x[n-2]`.

3. **Final Output State:**
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `x` remains unchanged.
   - `a` is updated such that each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) is the cumulative sum of the previous element of `a` and the corresponding element of `x`.

In natural language, the final output state is:

- `t` is still an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is the same integer input by the user.
- `x` is the same list of integers obtained from the input.
- `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 500, and each subsequent element `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` is the cumulative sum of the previous element of `a` and the corresponding element of `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the integer input by the user; `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 500 and `a[i]` for `i > 0` is the cumulative sum of `a[i-1]` and `x[i-1]`.**
