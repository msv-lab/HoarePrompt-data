Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` remains unchanged, `n` is the integer value of the user's input for each test case, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input for each test case, and `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n - 1`) is the cumulative sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`, starting with `a[0] = 500`. The loop processes each test case independently, and for each test case, it prints the list `a`.**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- The variable `t` (the number of test cases) remains the same as it was initially.
- For each test case, `n` is the integer input by the user.
- `x` is the list of integers provided by the user for that test case.
- `a` is a list where the first element is 500, and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x`.
- The loop processes each test case independently and prints the list `a` for each test case.
