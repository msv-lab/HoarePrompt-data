The code sets the first element of the list `a` to 500. The other variables and their values remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element set to 500.**
