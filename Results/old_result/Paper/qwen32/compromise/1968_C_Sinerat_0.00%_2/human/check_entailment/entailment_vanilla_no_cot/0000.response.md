Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

The problem requires constructing an array `a` such that for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`, `a[i] mod a[i-1] = x[i]`, where `x` is the input array.

The given program initializes `a[0]` to 500 and then for each subsequent element `a[i]`, it sets `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`. This approach does not guarantee that the condition `a[i] mod a[i-1] = x[i]` will be satisfied.

For example, consider the first test case from the problem statement:
```
4
2 4 1
```
The program would produce:
```
500 502 506 507
```
But checking the conditions:
- `502 % 500 = 2` (satisfied)
- `506 % 502 = 4` (satisfied)
- `507 % 506 = 1` (satisfied)

This specific case works, but let's consider another case:
```
3
1 1
```
The program would produce:
```
500 501 502
```
But checking the conditions:
- `501 % 500 = 1` (satisfied)
- `502 % 501 = 1` (satisfied)

This also works, but it's not guaranteed to work for all inputs. The program does not ensure that the condition `a[i] mod a[i-1] = x[i]` is met for every possible input.

To ensure the condition is met, a more systematic approach is needed. One possible solution is to set `a[0]` to a sufficiently large number (like `501`), and then set `a[i]` to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]` only if `x[i-1] != 0`. If `x[i-1] == 0`, then `a[i]` can be set to `a[i-1]`. However, a more robust solution would be to set `a[i]` to `a[i-1] + k * a[i-1] + x[i-1]` for some integer `k`, ensuring that `a[i] mod a[i-1] = x[i-1]`.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not guarantee correctness for all inputs.

Thus, the response is:
Correctness: **False**
