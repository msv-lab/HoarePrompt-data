Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer within the range 2 to 1000.
- `n` is a newly input integer.
- `a` is an empty list.
- `res` is 0.

The Python code snippet provided is:
```python
print(a)
```

We need to determine what will be printed when this `print` statement executes.

Since `a` is explicitly described as an empty list in the initial state, the print statement will output the representation of an empty list.

Output: **[]**
