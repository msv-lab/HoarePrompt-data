Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 2 to 1000, `n` is a newly input integer, `a` is an empty list, `res` is 0.**

Explanation: The list `a` initially contains one element, which is 0. The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first (and only) element from the list `a`, making `a` an empty list. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `res`) remain unchanged.
