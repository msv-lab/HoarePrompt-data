The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Since the initial state does not provide a value for `res`, we can only state that it has been incremented by 1. The other variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is the newly input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is 4, `res` is incremented by 1**.
