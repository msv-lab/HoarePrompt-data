The code snippet provided does not change the value of `res` as it is already initialized to 0. Therefore, the state of `res` remains the same. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 2 to 1000, `n` is a newly input integer, `a` is a list of integers based on the new input, `res` is 0**.
