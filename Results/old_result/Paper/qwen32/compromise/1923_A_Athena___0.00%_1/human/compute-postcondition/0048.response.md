The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that `a` is initially `[0]`, after executing `a.pop()`, `a` will become an empty list `[]`. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `res` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 999, `n` is a newly input integer, `a` is `[]`, `res` is 0**.
