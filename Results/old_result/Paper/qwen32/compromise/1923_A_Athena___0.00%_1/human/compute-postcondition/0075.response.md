The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that `a` initially contains at least one element which is `0`, after the `pop()` operation, `a` will be an empty list if it initially only contained the element `0`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 2 to 1000, `n` is a newly input integer, `a` is an empty list, `res` is 0**.
