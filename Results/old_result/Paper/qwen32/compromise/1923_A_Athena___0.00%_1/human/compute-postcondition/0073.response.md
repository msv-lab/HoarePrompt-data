Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 2 to 1000, `n` is a newly input integer, `a` is an empty list, `res` is 0.**

In simple terms, after all iterations of the loop, the variable `t` remains the same input integer within the range of 2 to 1000, `n` remains the newly input integer, `a` becomes an empty list because the loop removes all leading zeros, and `res` remains 0 as it is not modified by the loop.
