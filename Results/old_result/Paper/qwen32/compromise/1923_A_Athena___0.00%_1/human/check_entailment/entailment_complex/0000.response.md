### Reasoning:

The task is to determine the minimum number of operations needed to make all chips form a single contiguous block without any free cells (0s) between them. The provided solution attempts to solve this problem by first removing leading and trailing zeros from the list of cells and then counting the remaining zeros.

Let's analyze the solution step-by-step:

1. **Removing Leading and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The solution correctly removes leading zeros by using `a.pop(0)` until the first element of the list is not zero.
   - Similarly, it removes trailing zeros by using `a.pop()` until the last element of the list is not zero.
   
   This step is correct because leading and trailing zeros do not contribute to the number of operations needed to form a contiguous block of chips.

2. **Counting Remaining Zeros:**
   - After removing leading and trailing zeros, the solution counts the remaining zeros in the list using a for loop and increments the `res` variable each time a zero is encountered.
   
   This step is also correct because the number of operations required to form a contiguous block of chips is equal to the number of zeros that need to be "filled" with chips.

3. **Printing the Result:**
   - The solution prints the value of `res`, which represents the minimum number of operations needed to form a contiguous block of chips.

However, there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement's interpretation. The solution provided counts the number of zeros that need to be filled with chips, which is indeed correct. But the problem does not require us to print the list `a` after processing (the line `print(a)` is unnecessary and should be removed).

### Conclusion:

The logic of the program is correct, and it correctly calculates the minimum number of operations needed to form a contiguous block of chips. The unnecessary print statement does not affect the correctness of the solution but can be removed for cleaner output.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
