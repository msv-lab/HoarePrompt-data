### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by first removing leading and trailing zeros from the list of cells. This step is correct as it ensures that we only consider the segment of the ribbon that contains the chips.

However, the logic for counting the minimum number of operations to form a single block of chips is flawed. The program simply counts the number of zeros in the trimmed list and prints that count as the result. This does not accurately represent the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a contiguous block.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of moves required to shift all chips into a single contiguous block. This involves determining the optimal position for the block and calculating the number of moves each chip needs to be moved to reach this block.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to form a single contiguous block of chips. It only counts the number of free cells within the segment of the ribbon that contains chips, which does not account for the actual movements of the chips.
