The input consists of an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 \le n \le 2\cdot 10^5) representing the number of piles, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot 10^5.
