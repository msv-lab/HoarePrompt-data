The code snippet `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Given the initial state, `t` and `n` are still integers with their respective constraints, and `i` has been incremented by 1. The list `arr` remains unchanged, but the set `s` will now include the element `arr[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, and `s` includes `arr[i]`.**
