The code snippet `s = set()` reassigns the variable `s` to be an empty set, discarding its previous value, which was a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from the original `arr` sorted in ascending order. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, and `s` is an empty set.**
