The code snippet `s.sort()` sorts the list `s` in ascending order. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a list containing all unique elements from `arr`, sorted in ascending order; If `n` is 2, `ans` remains 1. If `n` is greater than 2, `ans` is 1 if (n-2) is even, and `ans` is 0 if (n-2) is odd; `i` is equal to `n`, indicating the loop has finished executing.**
