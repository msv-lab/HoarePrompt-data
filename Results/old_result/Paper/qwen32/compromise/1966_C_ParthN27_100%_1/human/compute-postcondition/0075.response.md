The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Alice'`. The initial state describes the value of `ans` based on whether `(n-2)` is even or odd, but this value is not used in the provided print statement. Therefore, the value of `ans` does not affect the output of the print statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state specifies the value of `ans` based on the condition of `(n-2)` being even or odd, but it does not affect the print statement.
2. The current value of `ans` is given as 1, but this information is not relevant to the output of the print statement.
3. The print statement directly outputs the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
