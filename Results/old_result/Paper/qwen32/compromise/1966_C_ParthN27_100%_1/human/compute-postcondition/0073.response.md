To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to follow the logic of the loop and the given conditions. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n - 2` (since `range(1, n-1)` generates numbers from 1 to `n-2` inclusive).

Given the conditions:
- `t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` and `n` must be greater than 2.
- `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.
- `s` is a sorted list containing `0` as its first element followed by all unique elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th element.
- `ans` is 1 initially.
- The loop runs for `i` from 1 to `n-2`.

The loop body:
- If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, the loop breaks.
- Otherwise, `ans` is toggled (`ans ^= 1`).

### Analysis:
- The loop checks consecutive differences in the sorted list `s`.
- If the difference between any two consecutive elements is greater than 1, the loop breaks.
- If the difference is 1 or less, `ans` is toggled.

### Output State after All Iterations:
- If the loop runs until `i = n-2` without breaking, it means all consecutive differences in `s` are 1 or less.
- Each toggle of `ans` will flip its value.
- The number of iterations is `n-2`. If `n-2` is even, `ans` will be 1 (since it starts at 1 and toggles an even number of times). If `n-2` is odd, `ans` will be 0.

### Conclusion:
The final state of `ans` depends on whether `n-2` is even or odd.

- If `n-2` is even, `ans` remains 1.
- If `n-2` is odd, `ans` becomes 0.

Given the format required, we need to state the final output state:

Output State: **ans is 1 if (n-2) is even, ans is 0 if (n-2) is odd.**

In natural language:
The final value of `ans` depends on the length of the list `s`. If the number of iterations (`n-2`) is even, `ans` remains 1. If the number of iterations is odd, `ans` becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial conditions.
