Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the length of the list `s` and is greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the loop or if statement is exited.
