Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a set containing the elements `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simple terms, the set `s` now includes the element at index `i` of the list `arr`, and `i` has been incremented by 1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
