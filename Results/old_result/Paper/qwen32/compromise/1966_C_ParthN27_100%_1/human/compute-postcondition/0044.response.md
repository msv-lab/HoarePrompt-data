The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. The variable `t` is not part of the loop head, nor is `arr` or `s`. Therefore, we only need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute. The initial value of `i` is not something we need to set manually before the loop starts, as `i` will be initialized by the `range(n)` function during the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, and `s` is an empty set**
