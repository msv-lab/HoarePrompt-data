Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Information:**
   - `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `n` is the length of the list `s` and is greater than 2.
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order.
   - `ans` is 1 (indicating that `n - 2` is odd or the loop did not break early).

2. **The Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('Alice')
   ```

The print statement directly specifies the string to be printed. It does not depend on any variables or conditions defined in the initial state. Therefore, the string 'Alice' will be printed as is.

**Output:**
Output: **Alice**
