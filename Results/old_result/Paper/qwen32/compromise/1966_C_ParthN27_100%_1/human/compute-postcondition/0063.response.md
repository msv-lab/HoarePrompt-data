The code snippet `ans ^= 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `ans` and `1`. Given that `ans` is initially `1`, the result of `1 ^ 1` is `0`. Therefore, `ans` will be updated to `0`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, and `s`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the length of the list `s` and `n` must be greater than 2, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing `0` as its first element followed by all unique elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th element, `ans` is 0, and the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is 1 or less**.
