The code snippet `s = [0] + s` prepends the integer `0` to the list `s`. Therefore, the list `s` which originally contained all unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, will now have `0` as its first element, followed by the sorted unique elements.

The values of `t`, `n`, and `arr` are not affected by this operation. The new state of `s` includes `0` at the beginning.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order.**
