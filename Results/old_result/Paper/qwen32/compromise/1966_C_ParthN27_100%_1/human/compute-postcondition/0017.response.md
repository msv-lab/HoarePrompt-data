The given initial state describes several variables and their relationships, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of these variables. The `print` statement is:

```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement will print the string `'Alice'` exactly as it is written, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, or `ans`.

Output: **Alice**
