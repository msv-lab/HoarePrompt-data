The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Since `s` was initially an empty set, after this operation, `s` will contain the element `arr[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a set containing the element `arr[i]`.**
