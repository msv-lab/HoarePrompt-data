Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order. If `n` is equal to 2, `s` contains `0` followed by a single unique element from `arr`. If `n` is greater than 2, `ans` is 1 if `n - 2` is odd or the loop did not break early, and `ans` is 0 if `n - 2` is even and the loop broke early.**
