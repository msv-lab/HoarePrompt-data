The code adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Given that `i` is 3, the element `arr[3]` is added to `s`. Since `s` initially contains the element `arr[i]` (which is `arr[3]`), adding `arr[3]` again does not change the set `s` because sets do not allow duplicate elements.

Therefore, the output state remains the same except that it is explicitly noted that `arr[3]` is in the set `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a set containing the element `arr[3]`, and `i` is 3.**
