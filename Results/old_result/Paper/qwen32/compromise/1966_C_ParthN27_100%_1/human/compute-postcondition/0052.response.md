The code snippet sorts the list `s` in ascending order. The values of `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The list `s`, which originally contained all unique elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th element, is now sorted.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, and `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th element.**
