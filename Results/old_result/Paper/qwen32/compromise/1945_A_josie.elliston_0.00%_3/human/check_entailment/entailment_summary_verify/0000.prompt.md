You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
from math import ceil
from typing import Optional
#Function 1:
def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if extroverts % 3 != 0:
        if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3:
            return None
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

#Function 2:
def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function takes three non-negative integer parameters: `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`. It returns -1 if the result of `func_1(extroverts, universals)` is `None`; otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and the result of `func_1(extroverts, universals)`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for the case where the number of universals is not sufficient to fill the remaining spots in the tents required for the extroverts. The function `func_2` also does not handle the case where there are leftover extroverts that cannot be accommodated with the available universals.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate this:

**Test Case:**
```
1
1 4 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-1
```

**Explanation of the Test Case:**
- We have 1 introvert, 4 extroverts, and 1 universal.
- Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly 2 others.
- The 4 extroverts would need 2 tents (since 4 / 3 = 1 with a remainder of 1, meaning 2 tents are needed to accommodate 4 extroverts with 2 in each tent).
- However, we only have 1 universal, which is not enough to fill the remaining spots in the 2 tents required for the extroverts.
- Therefore, it is impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences, and the output should be -1.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The program will output `3` for the above test case, which is incorrect. The program does not correctly handle the situation where the number of universals is insufficient to fill the remaining spots in the tents required for the extroverts.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
