Let's analyze the problem step-by-step and the provided solution to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Introverts (a)**: Each must stay in a tent alone. So, `a` tents are required for introverts.
2. **Extroverts (b)**: Each extrovert wants a tent with two others. Therefore, the number of extroverts must be divisible by 3 to form complete tents. If `b` is not divisible by 3, we need to check if we can accommodate the remaining extroverts with universals.
3. **Universals (c)**: They can stay in a tent alone, with one other person, or with two others. They are flexible and can be used to fill incomplete tents.

### Solution Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - This function determines if the extroverts can be accommodated in tents with universals.
    - If `b % 3 != 0`, it means there are leftover extroverts that need to be paired with universals.
    - If the leftover extroverts plus the universals are less than 3, then it's impossible to form a tent, and the function returns `None`.
    - Otherwise, it calculates the total number of tents needed for extroverts and universals by dividing the sum `(b + c)` by 3 and rounding up using `ceil`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
    - This function calculates the total number of tents required.
    - It first calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
    - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the participants, and `func_2` returns `-1`.
    - Otherwise, it adds the number of tents needed for introverts (`a`) to the result from `func_1` and returns the sum.

### Test Cases:
Let's verify the solution against some test cases:

1. **Test Case 1: `a = 1, b = 2, c = 3`**
    - `func_1(2, 3)`:
        - `2 % 3 != 0` and `2 + 3 >= 3`, so it calculates `ceil((2 + 3) / 3) = ceil(5 / 3) = 2`.
    - `func_2(1, 2, 3)`:
        - Calls `func_1` which returns `2`.
        - Returns `1 + 2 = 3`.
    - **Expected Output: `3`** (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2: `a = 1, b = 4, c = 1`**
    - `func_1(4, 1)`:
        - `4 % 3 != 0` and `4 + 1 < 3`, so it returns `None`.
    - `func_2(1, 4, 1)`:
        - Calls `func_1` which returns `None`.
        - Returns `-1`.
    - **Expected Output: `-1`** (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3: `a = 1, b = 4, c = 2`**
    - `func_1(4, 2)`:
        - `4 % 3 != 0` and `4 + 2 >= 3`, so it calculates `ceil((4 + 2) / 3) = ceil(6 / 3) = 2`.
    - `func_2(1, 4, 2)`:
        - Calls `func_1` which returns `2`.
        - Returns `1 + 2 = 3`.
    - **Expected Output: `3`** (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4: `a = 1, b = 1, c = 1`**
    - `func_1(1, 1)`:
        - `1 % 3 != 0` and `1 + 1 >= 3`, so it calculates `ceil((1 + 1) / 3) = ceil(2 / 3) = 1`.
    - `func_2(1, 1, 1)`:
        - Calls `func_1` which returns `1`.
        - Returns `1 + 1 = 2`.
    - **Expected Output: `-1`** (Incorrect, the correct output should be `2`)

5. **Test Case 5: `a = 1, b = 3, c = 2`**
    - `func_1(3, 2)`:
        - `3 % 3 == 0`, so it calculates `ceil((3 + 2) / 3) = ceil(5 / 3) = 2`.
    - `func_2(1, 3, 2)`:
        - Calls `func_1` which returns `2`.
        - Returns `1 + 2 = 3`.
    - **Expected Output: `3`** (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The solution mostly works correctly, but there is a mistake in the logic for handling the case where `b % 3 == 0`. In such cases, the function should directly return the number of tents needed for extroverts (which is `b // 3`) and then add the tents needed for introverts. The current implementation incorrectly calculates the number of tents for extroverts and universals even when `b % 3 == 0`.

Thus, the solution is **incorrect**.

**Correctness: False**
