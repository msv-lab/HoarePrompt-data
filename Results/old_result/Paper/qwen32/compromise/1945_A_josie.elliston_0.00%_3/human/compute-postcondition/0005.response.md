To determine the output state, we need to consider the given conditions and the return statement.

1. `extroverts` is a non-negative integer.
2. `universals` is a non-negative integer.
3. If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, then the sum of the remainder when `extroverts` is divided by 3 and `universals` is 3 or greater.

The code snippet returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3.

Let's break it down:

- If `extroverts` is divisible by 3, the remainder is 0, and the condition about the sum of the remainder and `universals` does not apply directly. The function returns the ceiling of `(extroverts + universals) / 3`.

- If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, the remainder when `extroverts` is divided by 3 is either 1 or 2. According to the condition, the sum of this remainder and `universals` must be 3 or greater. This means `universals` must be at least 2 if the remainder is 1, or at least 1 if the remainder is 2. In either case, the sum `(extroverts + universals)` will be such that the ceiling of `(extroverts + universals) / 3` will be at least 2.

Given these conditions, the return value can be calculated based on the values of `extroverts` and `universals`.

Output State: **The program returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3. If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, the sum of the remainder when `extroverts` is divided by 3 and `universals` is 3 or greater, ensuring the result is at least 2.**
