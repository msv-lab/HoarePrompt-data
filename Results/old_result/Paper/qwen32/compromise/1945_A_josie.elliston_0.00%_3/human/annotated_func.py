    #The program returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3. If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, the sum of the remainder when `extroverts` is divided by 3 and `universals` is 3 or greater, ensuring the result is at least 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integer parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`. It returns `None` if `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of the remainder when `extroverts` is divided by 3 and `universals` is less than 3. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: introverts, extroverts, and universals are non-negative integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals respectively.

    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret
    #The program returns -1 if `ret` is None, otherwise it returns the sum of `introverts` and `ret`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes three non-negative integer parameters: `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`. It returns -1 if the result of `func_1(extroverts, universals)` is `None`; otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and the result of `func_1(extroverts, universals)`.
