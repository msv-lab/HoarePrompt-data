Output State: **`num` is a list of test cases with at least one test case, `counter` is 0, `i` is `len(num) - 1`, and the element at index `i` in `num` is not '0' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `num`, `counter`, and `i` do not change. The only impact is that the loop or if statement we were directly inside is broken out of.
