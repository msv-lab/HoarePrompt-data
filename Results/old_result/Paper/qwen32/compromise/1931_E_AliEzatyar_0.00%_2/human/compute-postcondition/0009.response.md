Output State: **`num` is a list of test cases with at least one test case, `counter` is 1 if the current value of `num[i]` is '0', otherwise `counter` is 0, and `i` is `len(num) - 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `num`, `counter`, and `i` remain unchanged. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without modifying any of these variables.
