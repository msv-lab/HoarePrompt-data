The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates in reverse order from `len(num) - 1` down to `0`. Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(num) - 2`, it means the next value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be `len(num) - 3` for the loop to continue executing.

The states of `num`, `counter`, and any other variables mentioned are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`num` is a list of test cases with at least one test case, and `i` is `len(num) - 3`.**
