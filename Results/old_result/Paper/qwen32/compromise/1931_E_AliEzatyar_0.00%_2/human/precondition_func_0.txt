num is a list of test cases, where each test case is represented as a list containing an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) followed by t pairs of lists. Each pair consists of a list with two integers [n, m] (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6) and a list of n integers [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n] (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
