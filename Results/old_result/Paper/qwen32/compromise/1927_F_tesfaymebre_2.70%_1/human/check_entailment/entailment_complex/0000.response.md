### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the program, we need to verify that it meets the problem description and the provided execution states.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program uses `func_1` to read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `func_6` is called, which reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m` using `func_3`.
   - It then reads each edge using `func_3` again, which splits a line of input into three integers representing two vertices and the weight of the edge.

2. **Graph Construction:**
   - The graph is constructed using a `defaultdict` of lists where each node points to its adjacent nodes.
   - The edges are stored in a list of tuples, each containing the weight and the two nodes it connects.

3. **Sorting and Processing Edges:**
   - The edges are sorted in descending order based on their weights.
   - A Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure is used to manage the connected components of the graph.
   - As edges are processed, the DSU structure is updated to merge components and track the minimum edge weight in each component.

4. **Finding the Cycle:**
   - When an edge is found that connects two nodes already in the same component, this edge is part of a cycle.
   - The program keeps track of the smallest edge weight found in this cycle.
   - A DFS is performed starting from one of the nodes of this smallest edge to find the vertices in the cycle.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the weight of the smallest edge in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It then prints the vertices in the cycle in traversal order.

### Issues Identified:

- **DFS Function (`dfs`)**:
  - The `dfs` function is supposed to find the cycle starting from `node_u` and ending at `node_v`.
  - However, the global variable `graph` is used within the `dfs` function, which is not defined within its scope. It should be passed as an argument to the function.
  - Similarly, `node_v` is used within the `dfs` function without being passed as an argument.

- **DFS Termination Condition**:
  - The DFS function returns the path when it encounters a node that has already been visited (`colors[curr] == 1`).
  - However, the condition to check if `node_v` is in the path (`if res and node_v in set_res`) is not correctly implemented. The path should be checked for the presence of `node_v` to ensure the cycle is complete.

### Correctness:

Given the identified issues, the program is not entirely correct as it does not handle the scope of variables properly and does not correctly ensure that the cycle includes `node_v`.

**Correctness: False**

The program would need to be corrected to properly handle the scope of variables and ensure that the cycle includes `node_v`.
