Output State: **`graph` is a defaultdict of lists; `edges` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order based on weight; `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with updated connected components; `n` and `m` remain unchanged; `_min_edge` is the weight of the smallest edge in the last updated component; `node_u` and `node_v` are the nodes of that smallest edge; `colors` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `res` is the result of the `dfs` function executed with `node_u`, `-1`, and an empty list.**

Natural language: The execution of the `dfs` function with `node_u`, `-1`, and an empty list results in the variable `res` being assigned the output of that function. All other variables, including `graph`, `edges`, `dsu`, `n`, `m`, `_min_edge`, `node_u`, `node_v`, and `colors`, remain unchanged.
