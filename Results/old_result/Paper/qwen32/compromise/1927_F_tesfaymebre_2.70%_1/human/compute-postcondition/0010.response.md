Functionality: **The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search on a graph starting from a given vertex `curr`, with `parent` indicating the parent vertex in the traversal, and `path` keeping track of the current traversal path. It returns the `path` if a specific node (`node_v`) is found in the path during the traversal; otherwise, it returns an empty list.**
