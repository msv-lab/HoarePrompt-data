The code snippet initializes a list named `colors` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This means that the list `colors` now contains `n + 1` zeros, with indices ranging from 0 to `n`.

Output State: **`graph` is a defaultdict of lists; `edges` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order based on weight; `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with updated connected components; `n` and `m` remain unchanged; `_min_edge` is the weight of the smallest edge in the last updated component; `node_u` and `node_v` are the nodes of that smallest edge; `colors` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
