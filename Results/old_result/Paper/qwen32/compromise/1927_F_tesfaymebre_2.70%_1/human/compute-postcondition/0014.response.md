Let's break down the given information and determine what will be printed by the `print` statement.

### Initial State:
- `graph`: A `defaultdict` of lists, which represents an adjacency list of a graph.
- `edges`: A list of tuples, each representing an edge in the graph with a weight, sorted in descending order based on the weight.
- `dsu`: An instance of the DSU (Disjoint Set Union) class, which is used to manage connected components in the graph.
- `n`: The number of nodes in the graph.
- `m`: The number of edges in the graph.
- `_min_edge`: The weight of the smallest edge in the last updated connected component.
- `node_u` and `node_v`: The nodes of the smallest edge in the last updated connected component.
- `colors`: A list of `n + 1` zeros, likely used for marking nodes during traversal.
- `res`: The result of the `dfs` (Depth-First Search) function executed with `node_u`, `-1` (parent node), and an empty list.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(_min_edge, len(res))
```

### Analysis:
- `_min_edge`: This variable holds the weight of the smallest edge in the last updated connected component. Since it is explicitly mentioned as the weight of the smallest edge, we can use this value as is.
- `len(res)`: This represents the length of the result list `res`, which is the output of the `dfs` function. The `dfs` function is likely used to traverse the graph starting from `node_u` and collects some information (possibly nodes or edges) in the `res` list. The exact content of `res` depends on the implementation of the `dfs` function, but we can describe its length based on the context.

### Output Description:
- `_min_edge`: This is the weight of the smallest edge in the last updated connected component.
- `len(res)`: This is the number of elements in the list `res`, which is the result of the `dfs` function starting from `node_u`.

### Final Output:
Output: **_min_edge, len(res) (where _min_edge is the weight of the smallest edge in the last updated connected component and len(res) is the number of elements in the result of the dfs function starting from node_u)**
