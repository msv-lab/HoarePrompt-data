The given code snippet modifies the adjacency list `adj` by appending the integer `b` to the sublist at index `a`. This means that the relationship between `a` and `b` is updated in the adjacency list.

Here's the impact on the variables:
- `adj[a]` now includes `b` in addition to its previous elements.
- All other variables (`L`, `R`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`L` is the largest integer such that the condition `numCuts > k` or `numCuts == k` and `leftover >= L` is not satisfied, `R` is `L + 1`, `z` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the sublist at index `b` includes `a` in addition to its previous elements, `a` and `b` are the two integers just read from input, `i` is incremented by 1.**
