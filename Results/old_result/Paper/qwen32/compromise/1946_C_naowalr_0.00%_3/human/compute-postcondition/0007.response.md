The code appends `a` to the list `adj[b]`. This means that the list at index `b` in the `adj` list now includes `a` as an additional element.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` includes `b` and `adj[b]` includes `a`; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from the input such that `1 <= k < n`; `t` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input.**
