The given code snippet reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This operation does not affect the values of `L`, `R`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `adj`, or `i`. It only updates the values of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`L` is the largest integer such that the condition `numCuts > k` or `numCuts == k` and `leftover >= L` is not satisfied, `R` is `L + 1`, `z` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the sublist at index `b` includes `a` in addition to its previous elements, `a` and `b` are the two integers just read from input, `i` is incremented by 1, `i` is now `i + 1` and `a` and `b` are the new integers read from input.**
