The code appends `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Initially, `adj[a]` includes `b` twice, so after appending `b` once more, `adj[a]` will include `b` three times. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. `adj[b]` remains unchanged as well, still including `a` three times.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are the new integers read from the standard input, `adj[a]` includes `b` three times, `adj[b]` includes `a` three times.**
