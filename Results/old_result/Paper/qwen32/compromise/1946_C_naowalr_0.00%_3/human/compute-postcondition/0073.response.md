To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition `R - L > 1`. This means that for the loop to continue, the difference between `R` and `L` must be greater than 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `L` and `R` are set based on the condition `numCuts > k` or `(numCuts == k and leftover >= x)`.
- If true, `L` is 50001 and `R` remains 100001.
- If false, `L` remains 1 and `R` is set to 50001.
- `z` is incremented by 1 in both cases.
- `n`, `k`, `adj`, `i`, `numCuts`, `x`, and `leftover` have specific values or conditions, but they are not directly relevant to the loop condition `R - L > 1`.

Let's analyze the two possible scenarios for `L` and `R`:

1. If `numCuts > k` or `(numCuts == k and leftover >= x)` is true:
   - `L` is 50001.
   - `R` is 100001.
   - Here, `R - L = 100001 - 50001 = 50000`, which is greater than 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed in this case.

2. If `numCuts > k` or `(numCuts == k and leftover >= x)` is false:
   - `L` is 1.
   - `R` is 50001.
   - Here, `R - L = 50001 - 1 = 50000`, which is also greater than 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed in this case either.

In both scenarios, the condition `R - L > 1` is satisfied, meaning the loop can execute one more time without any adjustments to `L` or `R`.

Thus, the state remains the same as at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`L` and `R` are set based on the condition `numCuts > k` or `(numCuts == k and leftover >= x)`. If true, `L` is 50001 and `R` remains 100001. If false, `L` remains 1 and `R` is set to 50001. `z` is incremented by 1 in both cases. `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist contains the indices of the nodes directly connected to the corresponding node, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `numCuts` is either greater than `k` or equal to `k` with `leftover` being greater than or equal to `x` in the first case, and less than or equal to `k` or equal to `k` with `leftover` being less than `x` in the second case. `x` is 50001, and `leftover` holds the result of `dfs(1, 1)` in both cases.**
