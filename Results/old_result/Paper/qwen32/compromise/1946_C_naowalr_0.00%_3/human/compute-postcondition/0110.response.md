The value of `x` is calculated as `(L + R) // 2`. Given that `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001, `x` becomes `(1 + 100001) // 2`, which is `50001`. The other variables (`i`, `adj`, `L`, `R`, `numCuts`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains the integers representing the connections read from the input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001**.
