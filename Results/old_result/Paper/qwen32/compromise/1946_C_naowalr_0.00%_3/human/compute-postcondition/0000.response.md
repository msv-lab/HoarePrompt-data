The code reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This does not affect the existing variables `adj`, `n`, or `k`.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, where each sublist contains the vertices adjacent to the corresponding vertex; `n` is the number of vertices in the tree; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n; `t` is an integer read from the standard input.**
