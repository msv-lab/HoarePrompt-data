The given code snippet initializes `adj` as a list of `n + 1` empty lists. This means that `adj` will now be a list with `n + 1` sublists, each initially empty.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `L` remains the final value that satisfies the condition.
- `R` remains `L + 1`.
- `z` remains incremented by the number of iterations + 1.
- `n` remains the first integer read from input and is greater than 1.
- `k` remains the second integer read from input.
- `adj` is now a list of `n + 1` empty lists.
- `i` remains equal to `n - 1`.
- `numCuts` remains 0.
- `leftover` holds the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

Output State: **`L` is the final value that satisfies the condition, `R` is `L + 1`, `z` is incremented by the number of iterations + 1, `n` is the first integer read from input and is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` holds the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.**
