### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment. The original assessment points out two main issues:

1. **Leading Zeroes in Single-Digit Hours**: The program should output single-digit hours without leading zeroes in the 12-hour format.
2. **Extra Space Before AM/PM**: The program outputs an extra space before "AM" or "PM", which is not required.

However, let's verify these points using the annotated version of the code:

- **Leading Zeroes in Single-Digit Hours**: The program indeed outputs hours with leading zeroes for single-digit hours (e.g., "01", "02", etc.). This is because `h1` is directly assigned the string values with leading zeroes.
- **Extra Space Before AM/PM**: The program does print an extra space before "AM" or "PM" due to the `sep=''` in the `print` function, which includes spaces in the concatenation.

Given these observations, the original assessment is correct regarding these two issues. However, let's verify if there are any other discrepancies:

- **Correct Conversion of Hours**: The conversion of hours from 24-hour format to 12-hour format seems correct in the provided code. For example, `13:00` correctly converts to `01:00 PM` and `00:00` correctly converts to `12:00 AM`.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate in pointing out the issues with leading zeroes and the extra space. Therefore, the program is incorrect based on the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
