The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. However, the loop will execute based on the value of `t` which is the number of iterations determined by `int(input())`. To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `t` is already given as `1 <= t <= 1440`, which means the loop will definitely execute at least once.

Since the loop head does not include `t` itself, we cannot adjust `t` directly in the loop head. But we can ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` is such that it results in a value greater than 0, which is already satisfied by the condition `1 <= t <= 1440`.

Therefore, no specific adjustment is needed for the loop head variables. The state before the loop starts is already sufficient for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440**
