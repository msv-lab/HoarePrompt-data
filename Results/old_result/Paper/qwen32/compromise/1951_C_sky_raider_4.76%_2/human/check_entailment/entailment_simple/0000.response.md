### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to see if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Key Points of the Problem:
1. **Inputs:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of days tickets are available.
     - `m`: Maximum tickets that can be purchased in a single day.
     - `k`: Total tickets to be purchased.
     - `a`: List of prices for each day.

2. **Constraints:**
   - Each day, the price of tickets increases by the number of tickets purchased on any previous day.
   - Goal is to minimize the total cost of purchasing `k` tickets.

3. **Approach:**
   - Sort the list of prices in ascending order.
   - Purchase tickets starting from the cheapest day.
   - Ensure that the number of tickets purchased per day does not exceed `m`.

#### Analysis of the Code:
- The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of prices `l`.
- It sorts the list `l` to get the cheapest days first.
- It initializes `s` to 0 and `c` to `k * k / 2`. This initialization of `c` seems incorrect because it doesn't represent any meaningful value in the context of the problem.
- It then iterates through the sorted list `l` and attempts to purchase tickets:
  - `s = min(m, k)`: This sets `s` to the minimum of `m` and `k`, which is correct.
  - `k -= s`: This reduces the number of tickets left to purchase by `s`.
  - `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2`: This updates the cost `c`. The term `- s * s / 2` is incorrect and doesn't align with the problem's requirements.

#### Issues in the Code:
- The initialization of `c` to `k * k / 2` is incorrect. `c` should be initialized to 0.
- The term `- s * s / 2` in the cost update is incorrect. The cost should simply be incremented by `l[i] * s`.

#### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        l.sort()
        
        s = 0
        
        c = 0  # Initialize cost to 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            k -= s
            c += l[i] * s  # Correctly add the cost of purchasing s tickets at price l[i]
        
        print(int(c))

# State: t, n, m, k, l, s, c
```

### Conclusion:
The original code is incorrect due to the improper initialization of `c` and the incorrect cost calculation. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
