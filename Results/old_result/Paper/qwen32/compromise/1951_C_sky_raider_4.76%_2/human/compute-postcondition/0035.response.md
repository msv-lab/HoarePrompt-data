The given code snippet only updates the value of `s`. The new value of `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `k - 2s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `s` is the smaller of `m` and `k`, `i` is `i + 2`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + 2 * (l[i] * s - s * s / 2)`, and `s` is updated to be the minimum of `m` and `k`.**
