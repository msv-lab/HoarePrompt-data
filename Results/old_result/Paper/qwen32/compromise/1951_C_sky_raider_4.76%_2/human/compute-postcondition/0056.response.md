The code snippet `k -= s` modifies the value of `k` by subtracting `s` from it. Given the initial state, `k` was initially defined as `k - min(m, k) - min(m, k)`, and `s` is `min(m, k)`.

After executing `k -= s`, the new value of `k` would be `k - s - s`, which simplifies to `k - 2 * s`.

Other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the updated state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `k - 2 * min(m, k)`, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + (l[0] + l[i]) * s - s * s`, `i` is 2**.
