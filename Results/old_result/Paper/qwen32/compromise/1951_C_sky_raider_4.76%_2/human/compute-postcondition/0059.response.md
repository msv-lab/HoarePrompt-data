To determine the output of the `print(int(c))` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand how the variables are defined and updated.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This seems to indicate the number of test cases or iterations, but it doesn't directly affect the calculation of `c` in this specific context.
2. **`n`**: The first integer from the input, representing the number of elements in the list `l`.
3. **`m`**: The second integer from the input, which could be used in determining the value of `s`.
4. **`k`**: Initially set to some value, then updated by subtracting the cumulative `s` from it.
5. **`l`**: A sorted list of integers read from the input.
6. **`s`**: Set to `min(m, k)` from the last iteration.
7. **`c`**: Initially set to `k * k / 2` plus the cumulative `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for all iterations.
8. **`i`**: Set to `n-1`, indicating the index of the last element in the list `l`.

### Calculation of `c`:
The variable `c` is calculated as follows:
- Start with `c = k * k / 2`.
- For each iteration (from `i = n-1` down to 0):
  - Update `s` to `min(m, k)`.
  - Update `c` by adding `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`.
  - Update `k` by subtracting `s` from it.

### Final Output:
The final value of `c` after all iterations is printed as an integer.

### Explanation:
Given the complexity of the iterative process, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `c` without knowing the specific values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `l`. However, we can describe the final value of `c` based on the described calculations.

### Final Output Format:
Output: **c (where c is calculated as k * k / 2 plus the cumulative l[i] * s - s * s / 2 for all iterations, with s being min(m, k) in each iteration)**

This description captures the essence of how `c` is computed based on the given initial state and the iterative process described.
