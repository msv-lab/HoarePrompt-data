The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `k - min(m, k)`, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + l[0] * s - s * s / 2`, `i` is 1**
