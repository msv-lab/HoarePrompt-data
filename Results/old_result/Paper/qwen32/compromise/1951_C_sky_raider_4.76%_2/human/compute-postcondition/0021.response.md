The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This affects the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` from the last iteration, `c` is the initial value plus the accumulated sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for all iterations, `i` is incremented by 1**.
