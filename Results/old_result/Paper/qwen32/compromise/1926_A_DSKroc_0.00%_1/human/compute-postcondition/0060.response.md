The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('A')
```

This statement directly prints the character 'A' to the output. The variables `t`, `q`, `s`, `ac`, and `bc` mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement is printing a hardcoded string 'A'.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply 'A'.

Output: **A**
