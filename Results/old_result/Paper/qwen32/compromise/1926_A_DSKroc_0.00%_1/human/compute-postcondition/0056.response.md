Postcondition: ***`t` is the integer input provided such that \(1 \leq t \leq 32\), `s` is a non-empty string, `q` is \(q + 1\), and `i` is the character at position `q` in the string `s`. If `i` is 'A', then `ac` is either 2 or 3 if `i` was 'A' before, otherwise `ac` is 2 if `s[q]` is 'A', otherwise `ac` is 1. If `i` is not 'A', then `ac` is either 1 or 2 if `i` was 'A' before, otherwise `ac` is 1 if `s[q]` is 'A', otherwise `ac` is 0. `bc` is 1 if `s[q]` is not 'A', otherwise `bc` is 0, and `bc` is incremented by 1 if `i` is not 'A'. If `i` is not 'A', `bc` is incremented by 1 again.***

To simplify the postcondition:
Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 32\), `s` is a non-empty string, `q` is incremented by 1, and `i` is the character at the new position `q` in `s`. If `i` is 'A', `ac` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not 'A', `ac` remains unchanged and `bc` is incremented by 2. Otherwise, `bc` is incremented by 1.***
