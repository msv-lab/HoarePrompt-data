Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer input provided such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32, and for each of the `t` test cases, there is a distinct string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    ac = 0
    bc = 0
    s = input()
    for i in s:
        if i == 'A':
            ac += 1
        else:
            bc += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the integer input provided such that \(1 \leq t \leq 32\); `ac` is the total count of 'A' characters in the string `s`; `bc` is the total count of characters in the string `s` that are not 'A'; `s` is the string input provided.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the integer input provided such that \(1 \leq t \leq 32\); `ac` is the count of 'A' characters in `s`; `bc` is the count of non-'A' characters in `s`; `s` is the string input provided; `q` is \(q + 1\).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the integer input provided such that \(1 \leq t \leq 32\); `ac` is the count of 'A's in the string `s`; `bc` is the count of characters in `s` that are not 'A'; `s` is the input string; `q` is the initial value of `q` plus the length of the string `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
