The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and there are `t` distinct strings, each of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'. After executing the code, the value of `t` is updated to the integer input provided, and the precondition regarding the strings remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input provided such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32, and for each of the `t` test cases, there is a distinct string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'.**
