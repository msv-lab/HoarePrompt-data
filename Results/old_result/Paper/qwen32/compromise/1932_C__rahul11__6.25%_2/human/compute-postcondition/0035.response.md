The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, if `s[k]` is 'L', `r` is initially `n - 1`. Decrementing `r` by 1 makes `r` equal to `n - 2`. If `s[k]` is not 'L', `r` is initially `n - 2`. Decrementing `r` by 1 makes `r` equal to `n - 3`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer read from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list where the first element is `ans % m % MOD`, the second element is `ans % m % MOD`, and the third element is `ans % m % MOD`; `ans` is `(ans // arr[r]) % MOD`; `c` is 2; `l` is 1 if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 2` if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 3`; and `s[k]` is either 'L' or not 'L'; `k` is `k + 1`.**
