The code snippet `ans = 1` sets the variable `ans` to 1. None of the other variables are affected by this statement. Therefore, the output state will have `ans` set to 1, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters read from the input; `res` is a list of `n` zeros; `ans` is 1; `c` is `n`; `l` is a value between 0 and `n - 1` depending on the sequence of 'L's and non-'L's in `s`; `r` is a value between 0 and `n - 1` depending on the sequence of 'L's and non-'L's in `s`.**
