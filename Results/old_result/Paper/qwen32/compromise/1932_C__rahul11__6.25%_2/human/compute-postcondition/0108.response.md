Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element, `s` is a list of characters read from the new input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `0`, `ans` is `i * i * i`, `c` is `n`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is `n - 1 - (number of characters in s that are not 'L')`, `i` is the next element in `arr` after the current one`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to `ans * i`, which means if `ans` was previously `i * i`, it now becomes `i * i * i`. Other variables remain unchanged.
