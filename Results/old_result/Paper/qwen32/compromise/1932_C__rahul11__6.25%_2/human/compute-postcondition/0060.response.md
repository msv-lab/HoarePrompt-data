Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element; `s` is a list of characters read from the input; `res` is a list of `n` zeros; `ans` is `ans * i`; `c` is `n`; `l` is a value between 0 and `n - 1` depending on the sequence of 'L's and non-'L's in `s`; `r` is a value between 0 and `n - 1` depending on the sequence of 'L's and non-'L's in `s`; `i` is the next element in `arr`.**

Natural Language: The value of `ans` is updated to be the product of its previous value and the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
