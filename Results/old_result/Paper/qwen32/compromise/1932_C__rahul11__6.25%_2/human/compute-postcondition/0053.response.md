The code snippet `res = [0] * n` initializes the list `res` with `n` zeros, overwriting its previous value. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `ans`, `c`, `l`, and `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters read from the input; `res` is a list of `n` zeros; `ans` is 1; `c` is `n`; `l` is a value between 0 and `n - 1` depending on the sequence of 'L's and non-'L's in `s`; `r` is a value between 0 and `n - 1` depending on the sequence of 'L's and non-'L's in `s`.**
