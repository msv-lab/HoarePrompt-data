The code snippet assigns the value of `ans % m % MOD` to the element at index `c` in the list `res`. Given that `c` is 3, this operation will actually extend the list `res` to have four elements, with the fourth element being `ans % m % MOD`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer read from the input, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list where the first element is `ans % m % MOD`, the second element is `ans % m % MOD`, the third element is `ans % m % MOD`, and the fourth element is `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is `(ans // arr[l]) % MOD`, `c` is 3, `l` is 2 if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1` if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 2` if `s[k]` is not 'L' and `l` is 0, or `n - 3` if `s[k]` is not 'L' and `l` is 1, `s[k]` is either 'L' or not 'L', `k` is `k + 1`.**
