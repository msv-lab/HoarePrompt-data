To determine the output of the `print(*res)` statement, we need to break down the given initial state and understand how the `res` list is constructed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This represents the number of test cases.
2. **n**: The first integer from the input, representing the number of elements in the list `arr`.
3. **m**: The second integer from the input, used in the modulo operation.
4. **arr**: A list of integers read from the input.
5. **s**: A list of characters read from the new input. Each character in `s` specifies an operation to be performed on `arr`.
6. **res**: A list of `n` elements where each element is calculated as `ans % m % MOD`.
7. **ans**: The product of all elements in `arr` divided by the appropriate elements in `arr` as specified by `s`, modulo `MOD`.
8. **c**: Initially set to `n`, but its role is not specified further in the problem statement.
9. **l**: The final value of `l` after processing all characters in `s`.
10. **r**: The final value of `r` after processing all characters in `s`.

### Calculation of `res`:
- `ans` is calculated as the product of all elements in `arr`, divided by the elements specified by `s`, modulo `MOD`.
- `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `ans % m % MOD`.

### Output:
The `print(*res)` statement will print all elements of the `res` list separated by spaces.

### Detailed Explanation:
1. **Product Calculation**:
   - Compute the product of all elements in `arr`.
   - For each character in `s`, divide the product by the corresponding element in `arr` (if the character specifies such an operation).
   - Take the result modulo `MOD`.

2. **Modulo Operations**:
   - After computing `ans`, compute `ans % m % MOD` for each element in `res`.

### Final Output:
The output will be the elements of the `res` list, which are calculated based on the above steps. Since the exact values of `arr` and `s` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `res`. However, we can describe the output format and the computation process.

Output: **res (where res is a list of n elements where each element is (ans % m) % MOD, and ans is the product of all elements in arr divided by the appropriate elements in arr as specified by s, modulo MOD)**
