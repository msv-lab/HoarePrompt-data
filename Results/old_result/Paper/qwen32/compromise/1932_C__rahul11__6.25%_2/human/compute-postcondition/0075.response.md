Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 2; `m` is the second integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters read from the input; `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD` and the second element updated to `ans % m % MOD`. If `s[k]` is 'L', then `ans` is `(ans // arr[l]) % MOD`, `l` is 1, and `r` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` divided by `arr[n-1]` modulo `MOD`, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 2`. `c` is 1 in both cases.**
