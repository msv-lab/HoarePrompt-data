Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer read from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list where the first element is `ans % m % MOD` and the second element is `ans % m % MOD`; `ans` is either `(ans // arr[l]) % MOD` if `s[k]` is 'L', or `(ans // arr[r]) % MOD` if `s[k]` is not 'L'; `c` is 1; `l` is 1 if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1` if `s[k]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 2`; and `s[k]` is either 'L' or not 'L'.**
