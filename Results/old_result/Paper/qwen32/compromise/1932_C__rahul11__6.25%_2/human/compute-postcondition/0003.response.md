Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
