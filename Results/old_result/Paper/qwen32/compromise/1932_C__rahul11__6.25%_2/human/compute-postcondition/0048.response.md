To determine what will be printed by the `print(*res)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the context of the variables involved.

### Given Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `m` is an integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `s` is a list of characters.
- `res` is a list where the first element is `1 % m` and the next `n - 1` elements are the intermediate values of `ans % m % MOD` after each division.
- `ans` is initialized to 1.
- `c` is initialized to `n`.
- `l` is a value between 0 and `n - 1` depending on the sequence of 'L's and non-'L's in `s`.
- `r` is a value between 0 and `n - 1` depending on the sequence of 'L's and non-'L's in `s`.

### Key Points to Note:
- The `res` list is initialized with the first element as `1 % m`.
- The next `n - 1` elements of `res` are intermediate values of `ans % m % MOD` after each division, but no specific division operation is mentioned in the precondition.
- The `MOD` is not explicitly defined in the precondition, so we'll assume it's a constant value, typically a large prime like \(10^9 + 7\), which is common in competitive programming.

### Analysis:
- The first element of `res` is `1 % m`, which simplifies to `1` if `m` is greater than 1.
- The next `n - 1` elements are described as intermediate values of `ans % m % MOD` after each division. However, since no specific division operation is mentioned, we can only assume that these values are derived from some sequence of operations on `ans`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, the `res` list will start with `1 % m` and will be followed by `n - 1` intermediate values of `ans % m % MOD` after each division. Since no specific operations on `ans` are mentioned, we can only describe the output in terms of the structure of `res`.

### Output:
Output: **1 % m followed by n-1 intermediate values of ans % m % MOD (where MOD is a constant value, typically 10^9 + 7, and ans is modified through some sequence of operations not specified in the precondition)**
