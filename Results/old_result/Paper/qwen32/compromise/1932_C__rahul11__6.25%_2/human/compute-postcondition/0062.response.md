Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters read from the input; `res` is a list of n zeros with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD`; `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr`; `c` is `n`; `l` is a value between 0 and n - 1 depending on the sequence of 'L's and non-'L's in `s`; `r` is a value between 0 and n - 1 depending on the sequence of 'L's and non-'L's in `s`.**

Explanation: The value of the first element in the list `res` is updated to the result of `ans % m % MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged.
