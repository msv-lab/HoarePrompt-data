Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `m` is the second integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters read from the new input; `res` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is `ans % m % MOD`, the second element is `ans % m % MOD`, and the third element is `ans % m % MOD`; `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` divided by `arr[r]` modulo `MOD`; `c` is 2; `l` is either 1 or 0; `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`; `k` is `k + 1`.**

Natural Language: The value of `r` is decremented by 1. If `r` was initially `n - 1`, it is now `n - 2`. If `r` was initially `n - 2`, it is now `n - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
