To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider how the loop modifies the `cnt` list based on the elements in `a`. The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a` and increments the count at index `x` in the `cnt` list. This process repeats until `iterations_left` is no longer greater than 0.

Given the information about the first three iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue to iterate as long as there are elements in `a` and `iterations_left` is greater than 0. After all iterations, the `cnt` list will reflect the frequency of each integer in `a`.

Let's summarize the final state:

- `iterations_left` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer.
- `a` remains unchanged as it is a list of integers read from the input.
- `cnt` will be a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `x` represents the number of times `x` appears in the list `a`.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`iterations_left` is 0; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `x` is the count of how many times `x` appears in `a`.**

In natural language, after all iterations, `iterations_left` will be 0, `n` will still be the input integer, `a` will still be the list of integers read from the input, and `cnt` will be a list where each position `x` contains the count of how many times the integer `x` appears in the list `a`.
