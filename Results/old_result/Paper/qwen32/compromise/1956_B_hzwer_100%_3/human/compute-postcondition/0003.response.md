The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value returned by `input()` which is within the range [1, 10^4], `a` is a list of integers obtained from the second input line.**
