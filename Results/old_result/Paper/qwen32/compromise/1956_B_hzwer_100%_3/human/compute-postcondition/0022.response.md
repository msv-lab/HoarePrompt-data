Output State: **`iterations_left` is decremented by 1 from its previous value and must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is set to the integer value of the user's input. The value of `iterations_left` remains decremented by 1 from its previous value, and it still needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to continue executing.
