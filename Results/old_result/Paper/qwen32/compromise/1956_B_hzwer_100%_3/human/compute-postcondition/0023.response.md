The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variables `iterations_left` and `n` are not modified by this code.

Given the initial state, `iterations_left` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again, and `n` is an input integer. After executing the code, `a` will hold the list of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`iterations_left` is decremented by 1 from its previous value and must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
