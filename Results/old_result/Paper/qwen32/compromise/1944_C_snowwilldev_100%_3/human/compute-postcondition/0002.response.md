The code snippet initializes a `defaultdict` named `cnt` with `int` as the default factory, which means that if a key is not found in the dictionary, it will automatically be initialized to 0. This does not affect the values of `N` or `a`.

Output State: **`N` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array as provided in the input; `cnt` is a `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory.**
