Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, and the length of `lst`, `n`, satisfies 2 <= `n` <= 50; `sorted_lst` is a list of integers that contains the same elements as `lst` but sorted in non-decreasing order.**

Natural language description: The original list `lst` remains unchanged, and a new list `sorted_lst` is created, which contains the same integers as `lst` but arranged in ascending order. The constraints on the values of the integers in `lst` and the length of `lst` remain valid.
