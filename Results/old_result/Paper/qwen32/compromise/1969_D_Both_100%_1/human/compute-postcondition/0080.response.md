The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable indicating the number of iterations. The loop will execute `k` times, and the loop head does not involve any other variables that need adjustment.

Given that the loop head does not involve any variables that change state (other than the implicit iteration count), the state of all other variables remains unchanged from the end of the previous iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration, except that the loop counter `_` implicitly increases by 1.

State: **`combined` is a sorted list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple. If `combined` is non-empty, `heap` contains the last element of the original `combined` list, while `current_profit`, `max_profit`, and `remaining_items` remain unchanged at 0, an empty list, respectively. If `combined` is empty, `heap` remains an empty list. `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is greater than 0, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, and `test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`**.
