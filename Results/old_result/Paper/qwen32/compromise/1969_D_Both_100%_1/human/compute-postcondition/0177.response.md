The code snippet `current_profit -= removed_item[0]` subtracts the first element of `removed_item` from `current_profit`. This affects the value of `current_profit`.

Given the initial state, `current_profit` is already adjusted based on the conditions involving `item` and `removed_item`. Now, it is further reduced by `removed_item[0]`.

Output State: **`heap` is updated with `item` pushed and the smallest element popped; `removed_item` holds the smallest element from the heap after the operation; `combined` has one less element than it did initially; `item` is the last element that was just removed from `combined`; if `removed_item` is not None, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` or adding `item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, and then further adjusted by subtracting `removed_item[0]`; `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of negated values from `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, and `test_cases` is greater than 0.**

In simpler terms: The `current_profit` has been reduced by the first element of `removed_item`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
