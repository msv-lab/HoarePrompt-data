The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `k` times. The value of `_` itself does not affect the loop's execution, but the loop will continue as long as the range has not been exhausted.

Given that the loop iterates `k` times, at the start of each iteration, the loop variable `_` is implicitly set to the next value in the range from 0 to `k-1`.

Since the loop variable `_` is not explicitly used within the loop body (as indicated by it being a throwaway variable), we don't need to adjust any other variables in the state except to acknowledge that the loop will execute as long as the current iteration count is less than `k`.

At the start of the next iteration, the loop variable `_` would be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`heap` is a list containing one more element (the last element of the previous `combined` list) if `combined` was non-empty; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer); `k` is a positive integer (greater than 0); `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is 0; `current_profit` is 0; `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element (bonus) in ascending order with one less element than before if `combined` was non-empty; `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1**.
