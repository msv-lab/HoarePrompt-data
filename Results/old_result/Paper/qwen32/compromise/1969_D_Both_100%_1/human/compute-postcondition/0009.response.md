The code snippet provided sets `current_profit` to 0. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer), `k` is `new_k` (a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `new_k` <= `new_n`), `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, and the list is sorted by the bonus values, `test_cases` must be greater than or equal to 1.**
