You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: heap is a list that will be used as a min-heap, remaining_items is a list that may store items not yet considered, n is a positive integer representing the number of items, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n, prices is a list of integers representing the prices for Alice, neg_prices is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, bonuses is a list of integers representing the bonuses for Bob, max_profit is an integer initialized to 0 representing the maximum profit found, current_profit is an integer initialized to 0 representing the current profit, combined is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, and the list is sorted by the bonus values.
def func_4():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        heap = []
        
        remaining_items = []
        
        n, k = func_2()
        
        prices = list(func_2())
        
        neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]
        
        bonuses = list(func_2())

        current_profit = 0
        
        combined = list(zip(neg_prices, bonuses))
        
        combined.sort(key=lambda item: item[1])
        
        for _ in range(k):
            if combined:
                heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())
        
        if combined:
            current_profit = func_3(combined, heap)
        
        if current_profit > max_profit:
            max_profit = current_profit
        
        while combined:
            item = combined.pop()
            if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
                current_profit -= item[1]
            else:
                current_profit += item[0]
            removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
            if removed_item:
                current_profit -= removed_item[0]
            if current_profit > max_profit:
                max_profit = current_profit
        
        print(max_profit)
        
    #State: `combined` is an empty list; `heap` contains up to `k` elements from the last iteration's `combined`; `current_profit` reflects the final profit after all adjustments in the last iteration; `max_profit` holds the maximum profit encountered across all iterations; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()` for the last iteration; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()` for the last iteration; `neg_prices` is a list of negated values from `prices` for the last iteration; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()` for the last iteration, and `test_cases` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters. It processes a predefined set of lists and variables including `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, and `combined`. The function calculates and returns the maximum possible profit (`max_profit`) based on the given prices, bonuses, and constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
