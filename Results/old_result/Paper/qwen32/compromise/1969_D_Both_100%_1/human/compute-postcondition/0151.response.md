Postcondition: **`combined` is a non-empty sorted list of tuples with `max(0, len(combined_initial) - k)` elements remaining, `heap` contains `min(k, len(combined_initial))` tuples from the original `combined`, `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negated values from `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0.**
