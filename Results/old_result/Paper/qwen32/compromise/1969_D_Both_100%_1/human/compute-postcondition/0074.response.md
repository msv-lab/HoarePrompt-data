The code snippet creates a new list called `combined` by zipping together the `neg_prices` list and the `bonuses` list. This means that `combined` will contain tuples where each tuple consists of a pair of elements from `neg_prices` and `bonuses` at the same index.

Given the initial state, `combined` was initially an empty list. After executing the code, `combined` will be populated with these tuples.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a pair of elements from `neg_prices` and `bonuses` at the same index; `heap` is an empty list; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`.**
