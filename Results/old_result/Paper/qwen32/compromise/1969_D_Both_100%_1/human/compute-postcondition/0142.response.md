The given code snippet pushes the last element of the `combined` list onto the `heap` using `heapq.heappush`, and then removes that element from `combined` using `pop()`. 

Here's the breakdown of the changes:
- `heap` gains the last element of `combined`.
- `combined` loses its last element.

Since `combined` is a non-empty sorted list of tuples, and `heap` was initially empty, after executing the code, `heap` will contain one tuple, and `combined` will have one less tuple than before.

Output State: **`combined` is a sorted list of tuples with one less element than before; `heap` contains the last tuple from the original `combined`; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of negated values from `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than 0; `k` must be greater than 0.**
