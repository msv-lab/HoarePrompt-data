To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop. The loop continues as long as `combined` is not empty.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `combined` is a sorted list of tuples with `max(0, len(combined_initial) - k) - 1` elements remaining.
- `item` is the last element removed from `combined`.
- `heap` contains `min(k, len(combined_initial))` tuples from the original `combined` with `item` pushed and the smallest element popped.
- `current_profit` and `max_profit` are adjusted based on the conditions involving `item` and `removed_item`.
- `remaining_items` is an empty list.
- `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_2()`.
- `prices` and `neg_prices` are lists derived from `func_2()`.
- `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`.
- `test_cases` is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `combined` must not be empty. Since `combined` has `max(0, len(combined_initial) - k) - 1` elements remaining, to ensure the loop executes again, we need to adjust this count to be at least 1.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `combined` has at least one element remaining.

State: **`combined` must have at least 1 element remaining; `item` is the last element removed from `combined` and satisfies either `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` or `item[0] + item[1] < 0`; `heap` contains `min(k, len(combined_initial))` tuples from the original `combined` with `item` pushed and the smallest element popped; if `removed_item` is not None, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` or adding `item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, and then further adjusted by subtracting `removed_item[0]`; `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of negated values from `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, and `test_cases` is greater than 0.**
