The code snippet provided initializes a variable `ans` as an empty string. The initial state of `s` and `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string.**

In plain English: The string `s` and its length `n` remain the same as in the initial state. The variable `ans` is now an empty string.
