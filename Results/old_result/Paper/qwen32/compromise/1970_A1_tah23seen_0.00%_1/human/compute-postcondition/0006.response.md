The code `d.pop(n)` removes the key `n` from the dictionary `d`. The initial state specifies that `d` is a dictionary where each key from `1` to `n` maps to the depth of nested parentheses at that position, and `d[n]` is `0`. After executing `d.pop(n)`, the key `n` is no longer in the dictionary.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary where each key from `1` to `n-1` maps to the depth of nested parentheses at that position.**
