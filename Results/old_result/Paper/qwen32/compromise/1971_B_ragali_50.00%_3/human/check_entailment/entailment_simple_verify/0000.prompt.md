You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        a = set()
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')

    #State: The variable `t` retains its initial value, `s` is the last processed string, `a` is the set of unique characters from the last processed string, `i` is the last character of the last processed string, `newstr` is the rearranged string of the last processed string if applicable, and `isreverse` is the reverse of the last processed string if applicable.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it does not guarantee that the rearranged string `r` will be different from the original string `s` for all possible inputs. Here are a few issues:

1. **Handling Strings with Repeated Characters:**
   - The program checks if the length of the set of characters in the string `s` is greater than 1. If it is, it attempts to rearrange the string by splitting it in the middle and concatenating the two halves in reverse order. However, this rearrangement might not always result in a different string.
   - For example, consider the string "aaaaa". The program will split it into "aaa" and "aa" and then concatenate them in reverse order to get "aaaaa", which is the same as the original string. The program should handle this case by outputting "NO" because there is no rearrangement that results in a different string.

2. **Handling Strings of Length 1:**
   - For a string of length 1, the program will output "NO" correctly since there is no way to rearrange a single character to form a different string.

3. **Handling Strings of Length 2:**
   - For a string of length 2, the program will output "YES" and then attempt to rearrange the string. If the string is "ab", the program will output "ba", which is correct. However, if the string is "aa", the program will output "NO" correctly.

4. **Handling Strings with Distinct Characters:**
   - For a string with distinct characters, the program will output "YES" and then attempt to rearrange the string by splitting it in the middle and concatenating the two halves in reverse order. This rearrangement will always result in a different string.

To fix the program, we need to ensure that the rearranged string is always different from the original string. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        if len(set(s)) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            # Find the first character different from the first character
            for j in range(1, len(s)):
                if s[j] != s[0]:
                    # Swap the first character with the first different character
                    newstr = s[j] + s[1:j] + s[0] + s[j+1:]
                    print(newstr)
                    break

# Example usage:
# func()
```

In this corrected version, the program finds the first character in the string that is different from the first character and swaps them. This ensures that the rearranged string is always different from the original string.
