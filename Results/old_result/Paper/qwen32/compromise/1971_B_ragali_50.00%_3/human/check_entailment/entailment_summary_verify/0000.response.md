Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- The task is to rearrange the characters of a given string `s` to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`.
- If no such string `r` exists, output "NO".
- Otherwise, output "YES" and the rearranged string `r`.

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        a = set()
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes `t` test cases.
- For each string `s`, it checks if the string contains more than one unique character.
- If it does, it prints "YES" and then attempts to rearrange the string based on specific conditions.
- If the string contains only one unique character, it prints "NO".

### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:
1. **Handling Strings with Repeated Characters:**
   - The program attempts to rearrange the string by splitting it in the middle and concatenating the two halves in reverse order. However, this rearrangement might not always result in a different string.
   - For example, consider the string "aaaaa". The program will split it into "aaa" and "aa" and then concatenate them in reverse order to get "aaaaa", which is the same as the original string. The program should handle this case by outputting "NO" because there is no rearrangement that results in a different string.

2. **Handling Strings of Length 1:**
   - For a string of length 1, the program correctly outputs "NO" since there is no way to rearrange a single character to form a different string.

3. **Handling Strings of Length 2:**
   - For a string of length 2, the program correctly outputs "YES" and rearranges the string. If the string is "ab", the program outputs "ba", which is correct. If the string is "aa", the program correctly outputs "NO".

4. **Handling Strings with Distinct Characters:**
   - For a string with distinct characters, the program outputs "YES" and rearranges the string by splitting it in the middle and concatenating the two halves in reverse order. This rearrangement will always result in a different string.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not guarantee that the rearranged string `r` will be different from the original string `s` for all possible inputs, particularly for strings with repeated characters where the middle split and concatenation do not change the string.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle all cases correctly, specifically when the string consists of repeated characters.
