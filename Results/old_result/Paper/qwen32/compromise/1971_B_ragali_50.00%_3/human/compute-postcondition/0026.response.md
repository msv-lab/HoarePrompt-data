Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `s` is a non-empty input string with leading and trailing spaces removed; `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the string `s`. If the length of the set `a` is greater than 1, `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s`, and `isreverse` is the reverse of the string `s`. If `newstr` is not equal to `s`, `newstr` is formed by rearranging the halves of `s`. Otherwise, `s` is a palindrome if `isreverse` is equal to `s`, and `s` is not a palindrome if `isreverse` is not equal to `s`. If the length of the set `a` is exactly one, the set `a` contains exactly one unique character.**
