Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's break down the situation step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `s` is a non-empty input string with leading and trailing spaces removed.
2. `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the string `s` and the length of `a` is greater than 1.
3. `i` is the last character in the string `s` to be processed.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('YES')` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`. The values of `s`, `a`, and `i` do not affect the output of this specific print statement because the string `'YES'` is hardcoded and does not depend on any variable or condition in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `s`, `a`, or `i`.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
