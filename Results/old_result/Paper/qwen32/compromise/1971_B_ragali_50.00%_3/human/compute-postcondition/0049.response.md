Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty input string with leading and trailing spaces removed; `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the string `s` and the length of `a` is greater than 1; `i` is the last character in the string `s` to be processed; `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s`. If `newstr` is different from `s`, then no additional changes occur to `s`, `a`, `i`, or `isreverse`. If `newstr` is equal to `s`, then no additional changes occur to `s`, `a`, `i`, or `isreverse`. `isreverse` is the reverse of the string `s`.**
