Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, and for each test case, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to an integer input by the user, but the precondition that `t` is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) still holds. The variable `s` remains unchanged and still holds a string of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
