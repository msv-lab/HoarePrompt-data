### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve optimally removes numbers from the sequence. Bob wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. Since the numbers are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4, we need to understand how XOR works with these values:

- \(1 \oplus 1 = 0\)
- \(2 \oplus 2 = 0\)
- \(3 \oplus 3 = 0\)
- \(4 \oplus 4 = 0\)
- \(1 \oplus 2 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 4\)

For Bob to win, the XOR of the remaining numbers must be zero. This happens when the counts of each number that contributes to a non-zero XOR result in pairs (i.e., even counts for each number). If there is an odd number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s, Bob can only win if the sum of the odd counts is exactly three (since \(1 \oplus 1 \oplus 1 = 1\) and \(1 \oplus 1 \oplus 1 \oplus 1 = 0\)).

The program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by:
1. Dividing each count by 2 (integer division) to determine how many pairs can be formed.
2. Checking if the sum of the remainders (when each count is divided by 2) is exactly 3. If so, it adds 1 to the result.

This logic correctly implements the requirement to maximize Bob's wins by forming pairs and handling the special case where the sum of the odd counts is three.
