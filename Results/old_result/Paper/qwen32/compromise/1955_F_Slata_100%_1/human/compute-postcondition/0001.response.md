To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand what the loop does and how it processes each test case. 

The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, which represent the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence, respectively. The loop then computes and prints a value based on these counts.

The computation inside the loop is:
```python
a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)
```

Here's a breakdown of what this computation does:
- `a // 2`, `b // 2`, `c // 2`, and `d // 2` each count the number of pairs that can be formed from the respective counts.
- `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2` computes the sum of the remainders when `a`, `b`, and `c` are divided by 2. This sum can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.
- `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` evaluates to 1 if the sum of the remainders is exactly 3, otherwise it evaluates to 0. This term accounts for the scenario where there is one leftover of each of ones, twos, and threes, which can be combined in a special way (though the exact nature of this combination isn't specified in the problem statement).

After processing each test case, the loop prints the result of this computation. The variable `d` (the count of fours) does not affect the final result in the same way as `a`, `b`, and `c` do in the special condition, so it is simply divided by 2 to count pairs.

Since the loop processes each test case independently, the output state is simply the sequence of printed results for each test case.

Given the initial state format, the output state will be a sequence of integers, each corresponding to the result of one test case.

Output State: **a series of integers, each representing the result of the computation for one test case.**
