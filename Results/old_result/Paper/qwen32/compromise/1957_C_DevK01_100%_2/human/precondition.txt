The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and k (0 ≤ k ≤ n), representing the size of the chessboard and the number of moves already played respectively. This is followed by k lines, each containing two integers r_i and c_i (1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n), representing the i-th move made by the player. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5 and that all moves are valid.
