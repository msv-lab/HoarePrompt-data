Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a few issues that need to be addressed for it to be correct:

1. **Modulo Operation in `func_1`**: The modulo operation in `func_1` should be `10**9 + 7` instead of `7 + 10**9`. This is a simple typo but crucial for the correct output.

2. **Handling of `n`**: The logic for reducing `n` based on the moves is correct, but the program assumes that `n` will always be positive after the reduction. However, if `k` is large enough, `n` could become negative, which would lead to incorrect results or errors in the `func_1` function.

3. **Function Definition Placement**: The definition of `func_1` should be placed before it is called in the main loop. In Python, functions must be defined before they are used.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    dp = [1, 1]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % MOD]
        dp.pop(0)
    return dp[-1]

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (n, k) = (L[0], L[1])
    for j in range(k):
        L1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        (a, b) = (L1[0], L1[1])
        if a != b:
            n -= 2
        else:
            n -= 1
    if n < 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(func_1(n))
```

This version fixes the issues mentioned above. It ensures the correct modulo operation, handles cases where `n` could become negative, and places the function definition before its use.
