The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is at least 2. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 4, and `n` must be at least 4 (since `i` must be less than or equal to `n`).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 4, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `dp` is a list with values [5, 9], `i` is 4**
