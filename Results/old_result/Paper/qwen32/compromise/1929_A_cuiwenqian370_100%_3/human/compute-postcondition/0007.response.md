The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`. The loop iterates over `results`, so whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If `results` is not empty, the loop will execute.

Given the provided state, `results` contains the results of `func_1(array)` for each iteration. To ensure the loop executes, `results` must have at least one element. The other variables (`array`, `data`, `t`, `index`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`array` is the last list of integers processed in the loop, `data` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `index` is incremented by 1 for each iteration plus the length of each processed array, and `results` contains the results of `func_1(array)` for each iteration, `results` must have at least one element**.
