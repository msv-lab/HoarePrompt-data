The code reads a line of input using `sys.stdin.read`, which is then split into a list of strings. This list is assigned to the variable `data`. The initial state specifies that `array` is a list of integers, but `data` will be a list of strings after the `split()` operation.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers with length n such that 2 <= n <= 100, and each integer a_i in the array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `data` is a list of strings, where each string is a representation of an integer from the input.**
