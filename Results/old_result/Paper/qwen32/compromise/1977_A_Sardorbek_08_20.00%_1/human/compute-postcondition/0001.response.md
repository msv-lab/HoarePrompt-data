The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the range is determined by `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `a`. If `a` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` are provided, but only `a` affects the execution of the loop.

To ensure the loop executes, `a` must be greater than or equal to 1. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, but they are part of the initial state.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, `a` is an integer such that `a` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is the loop variable that will start from 0**
