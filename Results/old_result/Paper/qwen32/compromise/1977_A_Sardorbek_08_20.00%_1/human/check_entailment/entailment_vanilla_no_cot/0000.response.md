Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The logic in the program is flawed for several reasons:

1. The condition `elif b < c: print('NO')` is incorrect. If `b < c`, it does not necessarily mean that it's impossible to end up with `m` cubes. For example, if `b = 5` and `c = 3`, it is possible to end up with 3 cubes by adding 3 cubes and then removing 2 cubes.

2. The condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2: print('Yes')` is incorrect. Here, `a` is the number of test cases, not the number of moves. This condition does not make sense in this context.

3. The condition `else: print('No')` is also incorrect because it does not cover all the cases correctly.

The correct logic should be based on the fact that the difference between the number of moves `n` and the number of cubes `m` should be even. This is because each pair of an addition and a removal operation cancels out, and the remaining operations should either all be additions or all be removals to reach the desired number of cubes.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (b - c) % 2 == 0 and b >= c:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

This program checks if the difference `(b - c)` is even and if `b` (the number of moves) is at least `c` (the number of cubes desired). If both conditions are met, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".
