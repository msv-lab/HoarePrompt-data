Postcondition: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= `bit` <= 29, `new_arr` is a list containing intermediate XOR values where the `bit`-th bit was 0, `xor` is the final XOR value after the loop, and `thing1` is -1 if the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 1; otherwise, `thing1` is the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)` and the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0. The `bit`-th bit of `x` is 1.**
