The code snippet assigns the result of the function `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)` to the variable `thing1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= `bit` <= 29, `new_arr` is a list containing intermediate XOR values where the `bit`-th bit was 0, `xor` is the final XOR value after the loop with the `bit`-th bit of `xor` being 0, `thing1` is the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`**.
