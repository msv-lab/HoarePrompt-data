Output State: **The program returns the length of `cur_arr`, which is a list of non-negative integers. Since the specific value of `cur_arr` is not provided, the output is the count of elements in `cur_arr`.**

However, given the initial state specifies that `bit` is -1, which is outside the range 0 <= bit <= 29, this value of `bit` does not affect the return statement. Thus, the output solely depends on the length of `cur_arr`.

For the sake of a precise answer, if we assume `cur_arr` is an empty list as no specific values are given, the length would be 0.

Output State: **The program returns 0**
