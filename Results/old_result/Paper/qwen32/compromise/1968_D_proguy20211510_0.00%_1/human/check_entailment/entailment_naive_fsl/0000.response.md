Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code makes incorrect assumptions and optimizations that may not hold true for all scenarios.

Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Assumption about Maximum Element**: The code assumes that the player who reaches the maximum element in the array `a` will always win. This is not necessarily true. The players can choose to stay at their current position or move to `p_x` on each turn, and the optimal strategy might involve not necessarily reaching the maximum element immediately.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Long Game Durations**: The code does not handle the case where `k` is very large (up to \(10^9\)) efficiently. The code attempts to simulate each turn, which would be too slow for large `k`. Instead, it should detect cycles in the permutation and handle them appropriately.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores**: The code calculates the scores by appending the maximum element to the scores if a player reaches it, but this does not account for the possibility of players choosing different paths that might yield different scores.

4. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases where the permutation might have cycles or where the starting positions are the same. For example, if `P_B` and `P_S` are the same, the code should correctly handle this scenario.

Here is a potential counterexample where the code might fail:

```
Input:
1
4 1000000000 1 1
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4

Expected Output:
Draw

Actual Output:
Bodya
```

In this example, both players start at position 1 and the permutation is a simple cycle `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Since both players follow the same path and the scores are the same, the correct output should be "Draw". However, the code incorrectly outputs "Bodya" because it does not handle the case where both players follow the same path correctly.

Therefore, the code is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
