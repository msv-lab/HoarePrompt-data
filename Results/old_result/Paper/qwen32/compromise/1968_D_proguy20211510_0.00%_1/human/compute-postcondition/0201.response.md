Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `ptsb` is a list with `len(pres) + 1` elements `[preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0], preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1], ..., preb[len(pres) - 1] + (k - len(pres)) * b[len(pres) - 1], preb[len(pres)] + (k - (len(pres) + 1)) * b[len(pres)]]`, `founds` is a boolean, `maxs` is the maximum value in the `ptss` list, `maxb` is the maximum value in the new `ptsb` list, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `foundb` retains its initial value, `b` is a list with one additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `s` now includes an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. The loop or if statement is broken out of.****

Natural Language: The values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `ptsb`, `founds`, `maxs`, `maxb`, `maxa`, `foundb`, `b`, `i`, and `s` remain as specified in the initial state, except that `i` is incremented by 1, and `b` and `s` each have one additional element added to them. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
