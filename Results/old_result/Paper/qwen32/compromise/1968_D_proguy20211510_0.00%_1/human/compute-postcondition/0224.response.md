The value of `ss` is incremented by `s[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is unchanged, `preb` is [previous elements of `preb`, `sb + b[i]`], `pres` is `[s[i]]`, `sb` is `b[i]`, `ss` is `ss + s[i]`, `s` must be a list with at least one element.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `preb` is [previous elements of `preb`, `sb + b[i]`], `pres` is `[s[i]]`, `sb` is `b[i]`, `ss` is `ss + s[i]`, `s` must be a list with at least one element.**
