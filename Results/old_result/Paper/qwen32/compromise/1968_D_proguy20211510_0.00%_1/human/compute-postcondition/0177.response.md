Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer; `ptsb` is a list with `len(pres)` elements `[preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0], preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1], ..., preb[len(pres) - 1] + (k - len(pres)) * b[len(pres) - 1]]`; `ptss` is a list with `len(pres)` or `len(pres) + 1` elements, depending on whether `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa` or not. If `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, `ptss` remains unchanged, and `founds` is `True`. Otherwise, `ptss` includes an additional element `pres[len(pres)] + (k - len(pres) - 1) * a[ps - 1]`, and `founds` is `False`. `maxs` is the maximum value in the `ptss` list, `maxb` is the maximum value in the `ptsb` list; if `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, then `maxs` is strictly greater than `maxb`; otherwise, `maxs` is less than or equal to `maxb`; if `maxs` is less than `maxb`, then `maxs` is strictly less than `maxb`; otherwise, `maxs` is equal to `maxb`. `p` is a list of integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`. `b` and `s` remain unchanged except `s` now includes `a[ps - 1]`. `foundb` retains its initial value. Additionally, if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, `s` includes the previous elements of `s` plus the value `a[ps - 1]`.**
