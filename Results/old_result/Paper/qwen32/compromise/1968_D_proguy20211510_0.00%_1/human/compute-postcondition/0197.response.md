Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer; `ptsb` is a list with `len(pres)` elements `[preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0], preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1], ..., preb[len(pres) - 1] + (k - len(pres)) * b[len(pres) - 1]]`. If `founds` is `True`, `s` includes an additional element `maxa` appended to it. If `founds` is `False`, `ptss` includes an additional element `pres[len(pres)] + (k - len(pres) - 1) * a[ps - 1]` and `s` includes `a[ps - 1]`. `maxs` is the maximum value in the `ptss` list, `maxb` is the maximum value in the `ptsb` list; if `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, then `maxs` is strictly greater than `maxb`; otherwise, `maxs` is less than or equal to `maxb`. `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`. `foundb` retains its initial value, `b` retains its initial value, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
