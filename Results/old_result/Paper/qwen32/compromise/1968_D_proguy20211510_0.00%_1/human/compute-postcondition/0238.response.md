The code snippet assigns the value of `k - (i + 1)` to the variable `rem`. This operation does not affect any of the other variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the new variable `rem` with its calculated value.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` that must have at least 1 element, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`**.
