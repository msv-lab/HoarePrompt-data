The code snippet `ss += s[i]` updates the value of `ss` by adding `s[i]` to it. Given the initial state, `ss` is already defined as `ss + s[i]`, so after this operation, `ss` becomes `ss + s[i] + s[i]`, which simplifies to `ss + 2 * s[i]`.

Here is the updated state of the variables:
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `preb` remains unchanged as `[previous elements of `preb`, `3 * b[i]`, `2 * b[i]`].
- `pres` remains unchanged as `[s[i], ss + s[i]]`.
- `sb` remains unchanged as `2 * b[i]`.
- `ss` is updated to `ss + 2 * s[i]`.
- `s` remains unchanged as it must be a list with at least `i + 2` elements.
- `i` remains unchanged as `i + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `preb` is `[previous elements of `preb`, `3 * b[i]`, `2 * b[i]`], `pres` is `[s[i], ss + s[i]]`, `sb` is `2 * b[i]`, `ss` is `ss + 2 * s[i]`, `s` must be a list with at least `i + 2` elements, `i` is `i + 1`.**
