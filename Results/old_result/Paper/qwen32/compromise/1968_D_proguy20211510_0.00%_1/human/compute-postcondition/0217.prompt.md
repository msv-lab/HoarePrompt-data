Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer; `ptsb` is a list with `len(pres)` elements `[preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0], preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1], ..., preb[len(pres) - 1] + (k - len(pres)) * b[len(pres) - 1]]`; `ptss` is a list with `len(pres)` elements `[pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0], pres[1] + (k - 2) * s[1], ..., pres[len(pres) - 1] + (k - len(pres)) * s[len(pres) - 1]]`; `maxs` is the maximum value in the `ptss` list; `maxb` is the maximum value in the `ptsb` list; if `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, then `maxs` is strictly greater than `maxb`; otherwise, `maxs` is less than or equal to `maxb`; if `maxs` is less than `maxb`, then `maxs` is strictly less than `maxb`; otherwise, `maxs` is equal to `maxb`; `p` is a list of integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`. If `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` are both equal to `maxa`, no additional changes are made to the variables. If `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa` and `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, no additional changes are made to the variables. If `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa` and `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, no additional changes are made to the variables. If neither `a[pb - 1]` nor `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, no additional changes are made to the variables; `b` is an empty list; `s` is an empty list; `founds` is `False`; `foundb` is `False`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if foundb and founds:
        b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        break
    if foundb:
        b.append(maxa)
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        foundb = True
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
    else:
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
    if founds:
        s.append(maxa)
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        founds = True
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
    else:
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer; `ptsb` is a list with `len(pres)` elements `[preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0], preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1], ..., preb[len(pres) - 1] + (k - len(pres)) * b[len(pres) - 1]]`; `ptss` is a list with `len(pres)` or `len(pres) + 1` elements, depending on whether `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa` or not. If `founds` is `True`, `s` includes an additional element `maxa` appended to it. If `founds` is `False`, `ptss` includes an additional element `pres[len(pres)] + (k - len(pres) - 1) * a[ps - 1]`. `maxs` is the maximum value in the `ptss` list, `maxb` is the maximum value in the `ptsb` list; if `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, then `maxs` is strictly greater than `maxb`; otherwise, `maxs` is less than or equal to `maxb`; if `maxs` is less than `maxb`, then `maxs` is strictly less than `maxb`; otherwise, `maxs` is equal to `maxb`. `p` is a list of integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`. If `foundb` is `True` and `founds` is also `True`, `b` is a list with one additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `s` includes `[(k - (i + 1)) * maxa]`. If `foundb` is `True` and `founds` is `False`, `b` includes `maxa` as its last element and `s` includes `a[ps - 1]`. If `foundb` is `False`, `b` includes `a[pb - 1]` appended to it and `s` includes `a[ps - 1]`. Additionally, if `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, then `foundb` is `False` and `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`. `founds` retains its initial value if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`; otherwise, `founds` becomes `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer; `ptsb` is a list with `len(pres)` elements `[preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0], preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1], ..., preb[len(pres) - 1] + (k - len(pres)) * b[len(pres) - 1]]`. If `founds` is `True`, `s` includes an additional element `maxa` appended to it. If `founds` is `False`, `ptss` includes an additional element `pres[len(pres)] + (k - len(pres) - 1) * a[ps - 1]` and `s` includes `a[ps - 1]`. `maxs` is the maximum value in the `ptss` list, `maxb` is the maximum value in the `ptsb` list; if `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, then `maxs` is strictly greater than `maxb`; otherwise, `maxs` is less than or equal to `maxb`. `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`. `foundb` retains its initial value, `b` retains its initial value, and `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `founds` is a boolean, `maxs` is the maximum value in the `ptss` list, `maxb` is the maximum value in the `ptsb` list, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `founds` is True, `s` includes an additional element `maxa` and the loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `founds` is set to True and `s` includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]`; otherwise, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]` and `s` includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]`. If `foundb` is True, `b` includes an additional element `maxa`. If `foundb` is False and `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, `foundb` is set to True and `b` includes an additional element `a[pb - 1]`; otherwise, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]` and `b` includes an additional element `a[pb - 1]`. The loop or if statement is broken out of if `foundb` and `founds` are True. The length of `ptsb` is `len(pres) + 1` if `foundb` and `founds` are True; otherwise, `ptsb` retains its initial length.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
