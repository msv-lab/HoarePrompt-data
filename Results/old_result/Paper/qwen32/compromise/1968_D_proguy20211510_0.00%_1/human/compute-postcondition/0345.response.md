The code snippet provided resets the variables `sb` and `ss` to 0. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` and `ps` are integers, `preb` and `pres` are empty lists, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0, `ptsb` and `ptss` are empty lists, `maxs` is undefined, `maxb` is undefined, `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list of integers accumulated based on the loop execution, and `s` is a list of integers accumulated based on the loop execution. If the loop runs all `k` times, `b` and `s` will have `k` elements. If the loop breaks early, `b` and `s` will have fewer than `k` elements, but both will have `maxa` as their last element.**
