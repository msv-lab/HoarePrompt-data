The code appends a new element to the list `ptss`. The new element is calculated as `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`. The value of `i` was incremented by 2, so the new element uses the value of `pres` and `s` at the new index `i`. The value of `rem` remains `k - (i + 1)`, but since `i` has changed, `rem` should now be recalculated as `k - (new_i + 1)`.

Output State: **`ptsb` is a list with two additional elements `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, `ptss` is a list with two elements `pres[i] + rem * s[i]` and `pres[new_i] + rem * s[new_i]`, `pres` must have at least `new_i + 2` elements, `rem` is `k - (new_i + 1)`, `i` is `new_i`**, where `new_i` is the previous `i + 2`.
