The code appends a new element to the list `ptsb`. The new element is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`. The values of `preb`, `rem`, and `b` are used in this calculation, but their specific values are not provided. The other variables, `ptss`, `pres`, `k`, and `i`, remain unchanged except that `i` is incremented by 1 in the initial state description.

Output State: **`ptsb` is a list with two additional elements `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, `ptss` is a list with one element `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`, `pres` must have at least `i + 2` elements, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`, `i` is `i + 2`**.
