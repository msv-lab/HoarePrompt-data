Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is a non-negative integer. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `ur` is increased by 2. Otherwise, the value of `ur` remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The values of `i`, `n`, and the condition for `ur` remain unchanged. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
