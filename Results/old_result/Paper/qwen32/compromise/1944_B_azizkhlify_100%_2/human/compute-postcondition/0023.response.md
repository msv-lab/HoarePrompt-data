To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the specific print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\). This variable is not directly relevant to the print statement we are analyzing.
2. **`n`**: The first integer from the input, which must be greater than 0.
3. **`k`**: The second integer from the input.
4. **`a`**: A list of integers obtained by splitting the next input line and converting each part to an integer.
5. **`l`**: A list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`.
6. **`r`**: A list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in the sublist `a[n:2*n]`.
7. **`re`**: Initialized to 0. This variable is not directly relevant to the print statement.
8. **`ul`**: Initialized to 0. This variable is not directly relevant to the print statement.
9. **`ur`**: Initialized to 0. This variable is not directly relevant to the print statement.
10. **`res`**: An empty list. This variable is not directly relevant to the print statement.
11. **`i`**: Initialized to 0.
12. **`l[a[i] - 1]`**: Given to be equal to 2, which means the count of the integer `a[i]` in the list `a` is 2.

### Specific Print Statement Analysis:

The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

Given that `i` is initialized to 0, the print statement will output:
- `a[i]` which is `a[0]`
- `a[i]` again, which is `a[0]`

Since `i` is 0, we need to determine the value of `a[0]`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, and since `i` is 0, this means `l[a[0] - 1]` is 2.
- This implies that the integer `a[0]` appears 2 times in the list `a`.

However, the exact value of `a[0]` is not specified in the initial state. We only know that it is an integer that appears twice in the list `a`.

### Conclusion:

The print statement will output the first element of the list `a` twice, separated by a space, with no newline at the end.

Output: **a[0] a[0] (where a[0] is the first element of the list a)**
