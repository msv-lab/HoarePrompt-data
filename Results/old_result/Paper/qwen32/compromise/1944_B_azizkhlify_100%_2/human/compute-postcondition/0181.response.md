The for loop provided is:

```python
for i in res:
    # the loop body is omit
```

In this loop, the only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the elements in the list `res`. To ensure that the loop executes, `res` must contain at least one element. The other variables mentioned (`n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus their states cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Given the conditions:
- `res` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
- The state of `i` is determined by the elements in `res` during each iteration, so we do not need to specify its initial state explicitly.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `res` to ensure it contains at least one element.

State: **`res` must contain at least one element**
