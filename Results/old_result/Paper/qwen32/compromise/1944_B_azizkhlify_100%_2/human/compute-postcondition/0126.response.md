To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. Given the loop statement `for i in range(n, 2 * n):`, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, and the value at `r[a[n] - 1]` has been incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `n + 1`. The variable `n` does not need to change for the loop to continue executing, as long as `i` is still less than `2 * n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n + 1`**
