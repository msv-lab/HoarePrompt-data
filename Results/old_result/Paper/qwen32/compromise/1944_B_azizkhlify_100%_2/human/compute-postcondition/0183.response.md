The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is an element from the iterable `res`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `res`. If `res` has more elements, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last element of `res`. For the loop to execute one more time, `res` must contain at least one more element after the current `i`. Therefore, `i` should now be the next element in `res`.

State: **`res` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `res`**
