The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is an empty list; `n` must be greater than 0; `k` retains its previous value; `l` is a list of `n` zeros except the element at index `a[0] - 1` which is 1 and the element at index `a[i] - 1` which is 2; `r` is a list of `n` zeros; `re` is 0; `ul` is 0; `ur` is 0; `i` is 2**
