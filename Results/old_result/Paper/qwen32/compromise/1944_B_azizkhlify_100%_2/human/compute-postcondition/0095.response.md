Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is `2`, `ur` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `r[a[i] - 1]` is not `2` and `ur` remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `i`, `n`, and the condition related to `r[a[i] - 1]` and `ur` remain the same, but we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
