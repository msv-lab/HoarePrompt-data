To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`n > i + 2`**: This condition tells us that `n` is greater than `i + 2`. However, it does not provide the exact value of `n` or `i`.
2. **`i = i + 2`**: This means that the value of `i` is updated to `i + 2`. However, the original value of `i` is not provided.
3. **`l[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged**: This indicates that the element in the list `l` at the index `a[i] - 1` is not modified. However, the list `l` and the list `a` are not provided.
4. **`ul` remains unchanged**: This indicates that the variable `ul` is not modified. However, `ul` is not used in the `print` statement, so it does not affect the output.

### Code Analysis:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

From the initial state, we know that `i` is updated to `i + 2`. Therefore, the `print` statement will print the value of `a[i + 2]` twice, separated by a space, and no newline character will be added at the end due to `end=' '`.

### Output Explanation:
- `a[i]` after the update `i = i + 2` is `a[i + 2]`.
- Since `a[i + 2]` is printed twice, the output will be `a[i + 2] a[i + 2]`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `i` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements in the list `a` and the updated value of `i`.

Output: **a[i + 2] a[i + 2] (where a[i + 2] is the element at index i + 2 in the list a)**
