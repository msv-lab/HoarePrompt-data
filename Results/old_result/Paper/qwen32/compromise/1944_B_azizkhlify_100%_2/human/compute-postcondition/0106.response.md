The provided code snippet contains a `print()` statement without any arguments. In Python, when `print()` is called without any arguments, it outputs an empty line.

Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

- The loop has printed all elements in `res`.
- `i` is the last element in `res`.
- If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then `i` is set to `2 * n - 1`.
- Otherwise, `i` retains its value as the last element in `res`.

However, the `print()` statement does not use or depend on any of these variables. It simply prints an empty line.

Therefore, the output will be an empty line.

Output: **(an empty line)**
