Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `r` is a list where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is either 0 or 2, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is `n + 1`. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of and `ul` and `ur` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `ul` and `ur` remain unchanged and the loop or if statement continues.**
