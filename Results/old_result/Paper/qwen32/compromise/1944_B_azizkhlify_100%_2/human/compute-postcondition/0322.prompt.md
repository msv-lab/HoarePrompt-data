Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= floor(n/2). a is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    l = [0] * n
    r = [0] * n
    re = ul = ur = 0
    res = []
    for i in range(n):
        l[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n, 2 * n):
        r[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n):
        if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
            print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
            l[a[i] - 1] = 0
            ul += 2
        if ul == k * 2:
            break
    k = 2 * k - ul
    if k:
        for i in range(n):
            if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
                print(a[i], end=' ')
                re += 1
                res.append(a[i])
            if re == k:
                break
    print()
    for i in res:
        print(i, end=' ')
    if ul != ur:
        for i in range(n, 2 * n):
            if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
                print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
                r[a[i] - 1] = 0
                ur += 2
            if ul == ur:
                break
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop has printed all elements in `res`, and `i` is the last element in `res`. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then `i` is set to `2 * n - 1`. Otherwise, `i` retains its value as the last element in `res`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop prints all elements in `res` sequentially. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, the loop has executed `n` times or fewer, and for each iteration, if `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, it is now 0, and `ur` has increased by 2. The values of `ul` and `ur` determine if the loop broke. If `ul` equals `ur`, the loop did not execute or broke due to this condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The printout of all elements in `res` has been completed. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, the loop has iterated from `i = n` to `i = 2*n - 1`, with `ul` remaining unchanged unless it equals `ur` at some point during the loop. `ur` is incremented by 2 for each iteration where `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`. The values in `r` are set to 0 for indices `a[i] - 1` where `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2 during the loop iterations. The loop prints `a[i]` twice for each index `i` where `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
