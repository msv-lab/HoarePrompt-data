Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `n` must be greater than 0.
2. `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement prints `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, and does not end the line with a newline character (due to `end=' '`).
- We need to determine the value of `a[i]`.

### Given Information:
- `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2.
- This implies that there is some index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` where the value is 2.
- Therefore, `a[i]` must be an integer such that when we subtract 1 from it, we get an index of `l` where the value is 2.

### Conclusion:
- Since `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, `a[i]` must be an integer that, when reduced by 1, gives us an index of `l` where the value is 2.
- However, without knowing the exact contents of `l`, we can't determine the exact value of `a[i]`. But based on the given information, we can say that `a[i]` is an integer such that `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2.

### Output Description:
- The print statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, and will not move to a new line after printing.

Given the information, we can describe the output as follows:
Output: **a[i], a[i] (where a[i] is an integer such that l[a[i] - 1] equals 2)**
