The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable iterating over `res`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in `res`. Since `res` must contain at least one element at the end of the previous iteration, we can infer that the loop has already processed one element. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `res` must contain at least two elements, and `i` should be the second element in `res`.

State: **`res` must contain at least two elements**
