Given the initial state where `i` is `n + 1` and `n` is a non-negative integer, the line of code `r[a[i] - 1] = 0` modifies the list `r` by setting the element at the index `a[i] - 1` to `0`.

The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, but the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is now `0`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `r[a[i] - 1]` is `0`**.
