Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `re` equals `k`, then `re` is updated to `k + 1` if `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, otherwise `re` is incremented by 1. The loop or if statement is broken out of. If `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, `res` includes `a[i]`. Otherwise, `re` remains unchanged and `res` does not include `a[i]`.**
