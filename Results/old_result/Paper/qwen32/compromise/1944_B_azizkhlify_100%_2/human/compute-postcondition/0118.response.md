The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. Additionally, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing.

The state of `l[a[i] - 1]` being incremented by 1 is part of the loop body and does not affect the loop head, so we do not need to adjust it.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2**
