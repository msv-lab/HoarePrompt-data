Postcondition: **`n` remains unchanged, `k` is `2 * k - ul`, `a` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `re` remains unchanged, `ul` is incremented by 2 for each index `i` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2 (but not exceeding `k * 2`), `ur` remains unchanged, `res` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1` if `re` is less than `k` after all iterations, otherwise `i` is the index where `re` equals `k`, and `res` contains all `a[i]` values for which `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` up to the point where `re` equals `k`. If `k` is 0, the else part is not executed and the state of variables remains as per the precondition.**
