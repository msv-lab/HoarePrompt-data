Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `res` contains `a[0]`. If `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, then `res` also contains `a[i]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `n`, `i`, and `res` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
