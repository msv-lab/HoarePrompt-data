The code `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at the index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` by 1. Given the initial state, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is `n-1`.

The value of `a[i] - 1` determines which index in `r` gets incremented. Since the exact values of `a` and `r` are not specified, we can only express the change in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, and the value at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` is incremented by 1.**
