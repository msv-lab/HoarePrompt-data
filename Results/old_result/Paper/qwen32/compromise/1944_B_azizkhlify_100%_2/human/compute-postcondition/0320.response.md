Postcondition: **The printout of all elements in `res` has been completed. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, the loop has iterated from `i = n` to `i = 2*n - 1`, with `ul` remaining unchanged unless it equals `ur` at some point during the loop. `ur` is incremented by 2 for each iteration where `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`. The values in `r` are set to 0 for indices `a[i] - 1` where `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2 during the loop iterations. The loop prints `a[i]` twice for each index `i` where `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`.**
