Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `r` is a list where the value at index `a[i] - 1` is either 0 or 2, `a` is a list of integers, and the current value of `ul` is equal to the current value of `ur`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of `n`, `r`, `a`, `ul`, and `ur` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
