To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the specific values that the variables `a[i]` will hold.

From the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
- `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next input line and converting each part to an integer.
- `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`, except if `l[a[1] - 1]` was 2, it is now 0.
- `ul` is either `k * 2 + 2` or `k * 2 + 4` if `l[a[1] - 1]` was 2; `ur` remains unchanged.
- `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in the sublist `a[n:2*n]`.
- `re` is 0.
- `res` is an empty list.
- `i` is 2. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ul` or `l[a[1] - 1]`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```
Given that `i` is set to 2, the statement will print the element at index 2 of the list `a` twice, separated by a space, and without a newline at the end.

Since the exact values of the list `a` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values to print. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the element at index 2 of the list `a` twice.

Output: **a[2] a[2] (where a[2] is the element at index 2 of the list `a`)**
