Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer. If `r[a[n] - 1]` equals 2, `ur` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged. `ul` is equal to `ur`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of `i`, `n`, `ur`, and `ul` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed. The `break` statement only affects the control flow by exiting the most internal loop or if statement.
