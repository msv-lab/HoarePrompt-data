Given the initial state, we have the following information:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1.

From the information provided, we know that `a[i]` is an index that, when decremented by 1, points to an element in the list `l` that has the value 1. However, the specific values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, and `i` are not explicitly provided, so we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

This statement will print the value of `a[i]` followed by a space, without moving to a new line (due to `end=' '`).

Since we know that `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, we can infer that `a[i]` is a valid index for the list `l` and that the element at position `a[i] - 1` in `l` is 1. However, without knowing the exact value of `a[i]`, we can only describe the output in terms of `a[i]`.

Output: **a[i] (where a[i] is an integer such that l[a[i] - 1] equals 1)**
