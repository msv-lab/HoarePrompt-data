To determine the output of the print statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
1. `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.
2. `i` is `i + 1`.

From the second point, it seems like `i` is being incremented by 1 before the print statement is executed. However, the initial value of `i` is not provided, so we can only infer that after the increment, `i` will be one more than its previous value.

### Print Statement:
```
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement prints the elements at index `i` of the list `a` twice, followed by a space.
- Since `i` is incremented by 1 before the print statement, the value of `i` used in the print statement is the incremented value.
- The exact value of `a[i]` cannot be determined without knowing the contents of the list `a` and the initial value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the element at the incremented index `i` of the list `a` twice, separated by a space.

### Output:
Output: **a[i] a[i] (where i is the incremented value of i and a[i] is the element at index i in the list a)**
