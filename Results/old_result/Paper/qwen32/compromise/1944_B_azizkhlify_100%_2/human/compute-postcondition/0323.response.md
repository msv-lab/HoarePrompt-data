Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing half the length of the list `a`, an integer `k` such that `1 <= k <= floor(n/2)`, and a list `a` of `2n` integers where each integer from 1 to `n` occurs exactly twice. The function returns a value based on the test case inputs, but the specific return value is not detailed in the given information.**
