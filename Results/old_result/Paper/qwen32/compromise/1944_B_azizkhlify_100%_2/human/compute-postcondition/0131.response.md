To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and the print statement itself.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is greater than 0.
2. `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is outputting the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
- The value of `a[i]` is not explicitly provided in the initial state. However, we know that `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, which indicates that the element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` is 2.

### Conclusion:
- Since `a[i]` is not explicitly given, we can only describe the output in terms of `a[i]`.
- The print statement will output the value of `a[i]` two times, separated by a space.

### Output:
Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element from the list a at index i)**
