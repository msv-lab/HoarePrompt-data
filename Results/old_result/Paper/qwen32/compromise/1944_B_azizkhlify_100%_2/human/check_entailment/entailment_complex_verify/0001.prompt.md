You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `2n` integers where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice. For each test case, it prints pairs of integers from the first half of `a` that appear exactly twice, then prints additional unique integers from the first half until `k` unique integers have been printed. If the count of printed pairs from the first half (`ul`) does not match the count of printed pairs from the second half (`ur`), it prints pairs of integers from the second half that appear exactly twice until the counts match.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We are given an array `a` of length `2n` containing each integer from `1` to `n` exactly twice.
- We need to find two arrays `l` and `r` of length `2k` such that:
  - `l` is a subset of the first `n` elements of `a`.
  - `r` is a subset of the last `n` elements of `a`.
  - The bitwise XOR of elements in `l` equals the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - It initializes two lists `l` and `r` of length `n` to count occurrences of each number in the first `n` and last `n` elements of `a`, respectively.
   - It counts the occurrences of each number in the first `n` elements and stores them in `l`.
   - It counts the occurrences of each number in the last `n` elements and stores them in `r`.

3. **Constructing `l` and `r`:**
   - It tries to construct `l` by including pairs of identical numbers from the first `n` elements of `a` until it reaches `2k` elements.
   - If `l` still does not have `2k` elements, it adds unique numbers from the first `n` elements until it reaches `2k` elements.
   - It constructs `r` similarly by including pairs of identical numbers from the last `n` elements of `a` until it reaches `2k` elements.
   - If `r` still does not have `2k` elements, it adds unique numbers from the last `n` elements until it reaches `2k` elements.

4. **Ensuring XOR Equality:**
   - The program does not explicitly ensure that the XOR of `l` equals the XOR of `r`. It simply constructs two subsets of the required size without checking their XOR values.

### Issues:
- The main issue is that the program does not guarantee that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` equals the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`. The construction of `l` and `r` is purely based on the count of occurrences and does not take into account the XOR values.
- The problem guarantees that at least one solution exists, but this program does not necessarily find such a solution.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` equals the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.
