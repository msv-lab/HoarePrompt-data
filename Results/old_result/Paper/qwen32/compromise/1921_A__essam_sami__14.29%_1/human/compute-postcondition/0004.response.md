Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. It then calculates the squared distances between two pairs of opposite corners of the square and prints the smaller of the two squared distances.**
