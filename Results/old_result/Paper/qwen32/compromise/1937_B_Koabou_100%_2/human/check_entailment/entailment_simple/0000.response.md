### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the grid and trying to find a path that results in the lexicographically smallest string. However, the program's logic is flawed and does not correctly determine the smallest string or the number of paths that yield it.

Let's analyze the issues in the code:

1. **Path Construction**:
   - The program tries to construct the smallest string by checking conditions involving the characters in the grid. However, the conditions and the way the string `s` is constructed are not correctly implemented.
   - The program sets `s` to `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]` when it encounters a specific condition, but this does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest path.
   - The program does not consider all possible paths and does not correctly handle the transitions between rows.

2. **Counting Paths**:
   - The variable `t` is supposed to count the number of paths that yield the smallest string. However, the logic for counting paths is incorrect.
   - The program sets `t` to `x - i + 1` under a specific condition, but this does not correctly count the number of paths that yield the smallest string.

3. **Output**:
   - The program outputs `s` and `t`, but `s` is not guaranteed to be the lexicographically smallest string, and `t` is not guaranteed to be the correct count of paths.

### Correctness:
Given the issues described, the program is not correct. It does not correctly find the lexicographically smallest string or count the number of paths that yield it.

**Correctness: False**
