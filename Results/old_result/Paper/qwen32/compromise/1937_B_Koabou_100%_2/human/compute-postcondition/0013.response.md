Let's break down the given initial state and analyze the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `s` is calculated as `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]`.
- `x` is set to `n - 1`.
- `y` is the last updated value of `y` during the loop.
- `t` is set to 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(t)
```

### Analysis:
The print statement is `print(t)`. According to the initial state, `t` is explicitly set to 1. There is no information provided that modifies the value of `t` before the print statement is executed. Therefore, the value of `t` remains 1.

### Output:
The print statement will output the value of `t`, which is 1.

Thus, the final output is:
Output: **1**
