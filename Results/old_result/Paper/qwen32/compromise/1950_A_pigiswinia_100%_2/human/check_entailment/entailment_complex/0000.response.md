Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine if the three digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE". Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It then checks:
   - If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
   - If `a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".

The conditions specified in the problem statement are accurately checked by the program. The program correctly handles all possible cases for the input values of `a`, `b`, and `c` within the given constraints.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the logic it implements.

Correctness: **True**
