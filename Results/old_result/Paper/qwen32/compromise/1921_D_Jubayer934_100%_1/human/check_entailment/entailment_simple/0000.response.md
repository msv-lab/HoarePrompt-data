### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to maximize the total difference \( D \) between two arrays, \( a \) and \( c \), where \( c \) is formed by selecting \( n \) integers from another array \( b \) and arranging them in any order. The goal is to maximize \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \).

The provided program sorts the array \( a \) in ascending order and the array \( b \) in descending order. It then calculates the absolute differences between corresponding elements from \( a \) and \( b \). The program uses a greedy approach to determine whether to use the smallest or largest remaining elements from \( b \) to maximize the difference.

Here is the detailed reasoning:

1. **Sorting**:
   - The array \( a \) is sorted in ascending order.
   - The array \( b \) is sorted in descending order.

2. **Greedy Approach**:
   - The program iterates through the elements of \( a \).
   - For each element \( a[i] \), it compares \( |a[i] - b[i]| \) (using the \( i \)-th smallest element from \( b \)) and \( |a[i] - b[-(n - i)]| \) (using the \( i \)-th largest element from \( b \)).
   - If the latter difference is greater, it switches to using the largest remaining elements from \( b \) for the rest of the elements in \( a \).

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - The program keeps track of the index `temp` where the switch occurs.
   - If no switch is needed, it continues using the smallest elements from \( b \).
   - If a switch is needed, it switches to using the largest elements from \( b \) for the remaining elements in \( a \).

4. **Output**:
   - The program calculates the total difference \( D \) by summing the absolute differences and prints the result for each test case.

The logic behind the greedy approach is sound. By sorting \( a \) in ascending order and \( b \) in descending order, and then deciding at each step whether to use the smallest or largest remaining element from \( b \), the program ensures that the differences are maximized.

### Conclusion:

Given the problem description and the provided program, the logic and implementation appear correct. The program effectively maximizes the total difference \( D \) by leveraging a greedy approach.
