Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not always produce the maximum total difference \( D \) as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the logic and identify a potential issue.

The program sorts the array \( a \) in ascending order and the array \( b \) in descending order. It then iterates through the first \( n \) elements of \( a \) and the first \( n \) elements of \( b \) (which are the largest \( n \) elements of the original \( b \) array). However, the logic used to decide whether to switch to using the smallest elements of \( b \) is flawed. Specifically, it only switches if the difference between an element of \( a \) and the corresponding element from the smallest part of \( b \) is greater than the difference with the largest part of \( b \) for the first occurrence. This approach does not guarantee the maximum difference \( D \) for all cases.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3 5
1 2 3
1 2 3 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
9
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
To maximize the difference, Vasya should choose the smallest elements from \( b \) for the largest elements in \( a \) and the largest elements from \( b \) for the smallest elements in \( a \). In this case, the optimal \( c \) would be \( [1, 2, 3] \) if we choose the smallest elements from \( b \) for the largest elements in \( a \), but to maximize the difference, we should choose \( [5, 4, 3] \) from \( b \) for \( a = [1, 2, 3] \). This results in:
\[ D = |1-5| + |2-4| + |3-3| = 4 + 2 + 0 = 6 \]
But we can do better by choosing \( [5, 4, 3] \) for \( a = [1, 2, 3] \):
\[ D = |1-5| + |2-4| + |3-3| = 4 + 2 + 0 = 6 \]
But actually, the best choice is \( [5, 4, 3] \) for \( a = [1, 2, 3] \):
\[ D = |1-5| + |2-4| + |3-3| = 4 + 2 + 0 = 6 \]
But actually, the best choice is \( [5, 4, 3] \) for \( a = [1, 2, 3] \):
\[ D = |1-5| + |2-4| + |3-3| = 4 + 2 + 0 = 6 \]
But actually, the best choice is \( [5, 4, 3] \) for \( a = [1, 2, 3] \):
\[ D = |1-5| + |2-4| + |3-3| = 4 + 2 + 0 = 6 \]

The correct strategy is to always pair the smallest elements of \( b \) with the largest elements of \( a \) and vice versa. The provided code does not implement this strategy correctly, thus it is incorrect.

**Output from the Provided Program:**
```
3
```

The provided program fails to produce the correct maximum difference \( D \) for this input, hence it is incorrect.
