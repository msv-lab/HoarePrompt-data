Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is `i`, `ans` is an empty list, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the new input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the new input, sorted in descending order, and the current value of `i` satisfies the condition that the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.`**

Natural Language: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `temp`, `ans`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The loop or if statement is exited, but no other variables are modified.
