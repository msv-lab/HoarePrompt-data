The given code snippet appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. No changes are made to `i`, `a`, `b`, `n`, or `temp` unless the condition in the initial state is met, which would break out of the loop or if statement. However, the provided code does not include any condition that would alter `i`, `a`, `b`, `n`, or `temp` directly. Therefore, the only change is to the list `ans`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`. If `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, `temp` is set to `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to `temp`. `ans` now contains `abs(a[i] - b[i])` appended to it.**
