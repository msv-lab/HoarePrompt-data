To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and the conditions that affect the variables `temp` and `ans`.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
   - `n` is the first integer from the input.
   - `m` is the second integer from the input.
   - `temp` is -1.
   - `ans` is an empty list.
   - `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input.
   - `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs `n` times, iterating over `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each `i`, the loop checks if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`.
   - If the condition is true, `temp` is set to `i` and the loop breaks.
   - If the condition is false, `abs(a[i] - b[i])` is appended to `ans`.

### Final Output State:
- The loop will iterate `n` times, and for each iteration, it will either break or append a value to `ans`.
- If the loop breaks at any point, `temp` will hold the index `i` where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` was true.
- If the loop completes all `n` iterations without breaking, `temp` remains -1, and `ans` will contain `n` elements, each being the absolute difference between corresponding elements of `a` and `b`.

### Conclusion:
- After all iterations, `temp` will either be -1 if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, or it will be the index `i` where the loop broke.
- `ans` will contain `min(n, i+1)` elements, where `i+1` is the number of iterations completed before the loop broke, or `n` if the loop did not break.

### Final Output State Format:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is either -1 or the index `i` where the loop broke, `ans` is a list of `min(n, i+1)` absolute differences, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.**

In natural language:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer between 1 and 100.
- The variable `n` remains the first integer from the input.
- The variable `m` remains the second integer from the input.
- The variable `temp` will be -1 if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, or it will be the index `i` where the loop broke.
- The variable `ans` will contain the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for the iterations completed before the loop broke, or all `n` differences if the loop did not break.
- The variable `a` remains a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input.
- The variable `b` remains a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.
