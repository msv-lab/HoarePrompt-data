The code snippet provided reassigns the value of `b` by taking a new list of integers from the input, converting them to integers, sorting them in descending order, and then taking the first `m` elements of this sorted list.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `m` is the second integer from the input
- `temp` is -1
- `ans` is an empty list
- `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the new input
- `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order

The output state will only change the value of `b` as it is reassigned by the code snippet. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is -1, `ans` is an empty list, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the new input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the new input, sorted in descending order.**
