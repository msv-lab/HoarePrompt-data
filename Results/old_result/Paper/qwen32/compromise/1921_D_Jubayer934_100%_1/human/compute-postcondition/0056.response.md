Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. `n` is the number of elements in list `a`. `m` is the number of elements in list `b`. `temp` is not -1, indicating that a break occurred during the loop at index `i` where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` was met. `ans` is a list containing the values `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for `i` from 0 to `temp-1`. `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the new input. `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.**
