The code snippet appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `temp`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The only change is that `ans` now includes the new element `abs(a[i] - b[i])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is either -1 or `i`, `ans` is a list containing `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and the element at the position `-(n - i)` in `b` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and the element at the position `i` in `b`, then `temp` is set to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1.**
