The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `temp`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the relationship between `temp` and `n`. If `temp` is less than `n`, the loop will execute. 

Given that the current value of `temp` is not -1, we need to ensure that `temp` is less than `n` for the loop to execute. Since `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer from the input, and `temp` is the index `i` where the loop broke, we need to make sure that `temp` is a valid index that is less than `n`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than `temp`, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is the index `i` where the loop broke and is not -1 and must be less than `n`, `ans` is a list of `min(n, i+1)` absolute differences, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order**
