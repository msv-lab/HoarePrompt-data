The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `temp`, and `n`. We need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- `temp` is an integer such that 0 <= temp < n.
- `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences calculated up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all `n` iterations, including the new value `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`.
- `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the new input.
- `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the new input, sorted in descending order.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was used in the calculation of the absolute difference and was incremented. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

The state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` will be `temp + 1` (since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration).
- `temp` will remain the same because it defines the starting point of the loop and does not change within the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it defines the total number of iterations.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is an integer such that 0 <= temp < n, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences calculated up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all `n` iterations, including the new value `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the new input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the new input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `temp + 1`**
