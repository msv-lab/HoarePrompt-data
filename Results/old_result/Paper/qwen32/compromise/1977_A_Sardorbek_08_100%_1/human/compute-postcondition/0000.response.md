The variable `a` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; `a` is an input integer.**
