Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, the program code, and the function summary provided.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move. The goal is to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The key points are:
1. If `n` (moves) is less than `m` (target cubes), it is impossible to have `m` cubes because we can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
2. If `n` equals `m`, it is possible if all moves are additions.
3. If the difference between `n` and `m` is even, it is possible to reach `m` cubes because pairs of moves (add then remove or remove then add) leave the number of cubes unchanged.
4. If the difference between `n` and `m` is odd, it is impossible to reach `m` cubes because we would end up with one more or one less cube than `m`.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down how the program handles these cases:
1. **If `b == c`:** The program correctly prints 'YES'. This is because if the number of moves `n` equals the number of cubes `m`, it's possible to build the tower by adding one cube in each move.
2. **If `b < c`:** The program correctly prints 'NO'. This is because if the number of moves `n` is less than the number of cubes `m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes as we can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
3. **If `b % 2 == c % 2`:** The program correctly prints 'Yes'. This is because if the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of moves `n` and the number of cubes `m` is the same, it's possible to reach `m` cubes by a combination of adding and removing cubes.
4. **Otherwise:** The program correctly prints 'No'. This covers the case where the parity of `n` and `m` is different, meaning it's not possible to reach `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Function Summary Validation:
The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the program:
- It prints 'YES' if `b` equals `c`.
- It prints 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`.
- It prints 'YES' if both `b` and `c` have the same parity.
- It prints 'NO' otherwise.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases mentioned above and adheres to the problem's requirements. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
