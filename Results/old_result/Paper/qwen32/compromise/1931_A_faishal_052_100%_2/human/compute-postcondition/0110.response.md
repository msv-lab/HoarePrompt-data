Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` and then the new `arr`, `i` is `i + 2`, `j` is 1, if `lex` was less than 28, `lex` is now `lex - 27` and `arr` is `[1, 26]`, if `lex` was greater than or equal to 28 and less than or equal to 78, `lex` is now `lex - 52` and `arr` is `[26, 26]`, if `lex` was greater than 78, `lex` is now `lex - 104` and `arr` is `[26]`.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is reduced by 26. Depending on the initial value of `lex`, the new value of `lex` and the array `arr` are adjusted accordingly. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `cases`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.
