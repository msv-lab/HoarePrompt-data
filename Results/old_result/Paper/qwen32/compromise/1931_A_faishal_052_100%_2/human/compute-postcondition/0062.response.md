The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the loop statement, `j` iterates over the range from 0 to 1 (inclusive). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be adjusted to the next value in the range.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `i + 1`. Since the loop iterates over `range(2)`, `j` can take values 0 and 1. If the previous iteration had `j` as 0, then the next iteration should have `j` as 1 for the loop to continue executing.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `j` set to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`, `lex` is an integer, `i` is `i + 1`. If `lex` was initially less than 28, `lex` is now `lex - 1` and `arr` is [1]. If `lex` was initially greater than or equal to 26 but less than or equal to 52, `arr` is [26]. If `lex` was initially greater than 78, `arr` remains an empty list, `j` is 1**
