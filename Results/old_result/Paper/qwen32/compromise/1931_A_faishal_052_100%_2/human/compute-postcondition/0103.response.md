Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` and then the new `arr`, `i` is `i + 2`, `j` is 0, `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` is less than 28, `lex` is now `lex - 1` and `arr` is `[1]`. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, `arr` is `[26]`. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, `arr` is `[26]`. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` remains `[]`.**
