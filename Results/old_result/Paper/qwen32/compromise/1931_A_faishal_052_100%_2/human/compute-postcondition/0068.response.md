Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state:

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78
- `cases` is greater than 0
- `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`
- `lex` is an integer
- `i` is `i + 1`
- If `lex` was initially less than 28, `lex` is now `lex - 1` and `arr` is [1, 26]
- If `lex` was initially greater than or equal to 26 but less than or equal to 52, `arr` is [26, 26]
- If `lex` was initially greater than 78, `arr` is [26], `j` is 1

Code Snippet:
```python
lex = lex - 26
```

Impact of the Code:
- The value of `lex` is decremented by 26.

Now let's consider the different cases for the initial value of `lex`:

1. If `lex` was initially less than 28:
   - After `lex = lex - 26`, `lex` will be in the range -25 to 1 (since `lex - 26` when `lex < 28`).
   - `arr` remains [1, 26].

2. If `lex` was initially greater than or equal to 26 but less than or equal to 52:
   - After `lex = lex - 26`, `lex` will be in the range 0 to 26 (since `lex - 26` when `26 <= lex <= 52`).
   - `arr` remains [26, 26].

3. If `lex` was initially greater than 78:
   - After `lex = lex - 26`, `lex` will be greater than 52 (since `lex - 26` when `lex > 78`).
   - `arr` remains [26].
   - `j` remains 1.

Given these conditions, the updated state of the variables is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`, `lex` is `lex - 26`, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr` is [1, 26] if `lex - 26` is in the range -25 to 1, `arr` is [26, 26] if `lex - 26` is in the range 0 to 26, `arr` is [26] if `lex - 26` is greater than 52, `j` is 1 if `lex - 26` is greater than 52.**
