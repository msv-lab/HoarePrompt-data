Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` and then the new `arr`, `i` is `i + 2`, `j` is 1, `lex` is an input integer minus 1, and `arr` is `[1, 1]` if `lex` was originally less than 28, `[26, 1]` if `lex` was originally between 28 and 78 inclusive, or `[1]` if `lex` was originally greater than 78.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `lex` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
