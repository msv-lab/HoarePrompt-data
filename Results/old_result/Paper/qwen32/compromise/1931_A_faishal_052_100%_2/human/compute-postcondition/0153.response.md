Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the new state:

- `info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`.
- `temp` is an empty string.
- `j` is 2.
- `i` is 4.
- `cases` must be greater than 4.

The line of code modifies `temp` by appending a character derived from the value at `info[i][j]`. Specifically, it adds 96 to the value at `info[4][2]` and converts the result to a character using `chr()`.

Let's denote the value at `info[4][2]` as `val`. The new value of `temp` will be `chr(val + 96)`.

Output State: **`info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`; `temp` is `chr(info[4][2] + 96)`; `j` is 2; `i` is 4; `cases` must be greater than 4.**

In natural language, the output state is: `info` remains a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`; `temp` now holds the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[4][2] + 96`; `j` remains 2; `i` remains 4; `cases` is still greater than 4.
