Let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78
- `cases` is greater than 0
- `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` and then the new `arr`
- `i` is `i + 2`
- `j` is 1
- `lex` is an input integer
  - If `lex` is less than 28, `lex` is now `lex - 1` and `arr` is `[1]`
  - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, `arr` is `[26]`
  - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, `arr` is `[26]`
  - If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` remains `[]`

Code Snippet:
```python
arr.append(26)
```

Impact:
- The code appends the value `26` to the list `arr`.

Based on the conditions for `lex`:
- If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` was initially `[1]`. After appending `26`, `arr` becomes `[1, 26]`.
- If `lex` is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, `arr` was initially `[26]`. After appending `26`, `arr` becomes `[26, 26]`.
- If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, `arr` was initially `[26]`. After appending `26`, `arr` becomes `[26, 26]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` was initially `[]`. After appending `26`, `arr` becomes `[26]`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `cases`, `info`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` and then the new `arr`, `i` is `i + 2`, `j` is 1, if `lex` is less than 28, `lex` is `lex - 1` and `arr` is `[1, 26]`, if `lex` is greater than or equal to 28 and less than or equal to 78, `arr` is `[26, 26]`, if `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is `[26]`**.
