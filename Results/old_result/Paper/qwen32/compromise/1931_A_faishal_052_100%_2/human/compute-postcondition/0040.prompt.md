Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` must be greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex < 28:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    elif lex <= 78:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, and `lex` is an integer. If `lex` was initially less than 28, `lex` is now `lex - 1` and `arr` contains the integer 1. If `lex` was initially 28 or more, `arr` contains the integer 26 if `lex` is less than 52, otherwise `arr` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `j` is 1. If `lex` was initially less than 28, `lex` is now `lex - 1` and `arr` contains the integer 1. If `lex` was initially between 28 and 51, `lex` is now `lex - 26` and `arr` contains the integer 26. If `lex` was initially 52 or more, `lex` is now `lex - 26` (if `lex` was initially less than or equal to 78) and `arr` contains [26] if `lex` was exactly 52, or `arr` remains unchanged as an empty list if `lex` was greater than 78.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `j` is 2. If `lex` was initially less than 28, `lex` is decreased by 1 and `info` is [1]. Otherwise, `info` remains an empty list. If `lex` was initially less than 52, `lex` is reduced by 26 and `arr` contains the element 26. If `lex` was initially 52 or more but less than or equal to 78, `arr` contains the element 26.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
