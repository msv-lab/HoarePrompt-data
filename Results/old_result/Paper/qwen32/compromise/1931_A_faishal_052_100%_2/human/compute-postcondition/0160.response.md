To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop progresses and modifies the variables involved. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The loop runs for `cases` iterations.
2. In each iteration `i`, it constructs a string `temp` by concatenating three characters derived from the first three elements of the `i-th` array in `info`. Each element is converted to a character by adding 96 to it (which corresponds to converting numbers 1-26 to letters 'a'-'z').
3. After constructing `temp`, it prints the string.

Given the initial state and the progression of the loop, the final state will be when `i` reaches `cases - 1`. At this point, the loop will have processed all `cases` arrays in `info`.

Let's formalize this:

- `info` remains a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`.
- `i` will be equal to `cases - 1` after the last iteration.
- `j` will be 2 at the end of the last iteration because the inner loop runs exactly 3 times.
- `temp` will contain the characters derived from the first three elements of the last array in `info`.

Therefore, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`; `temp` is a string containing the characters `chr(info[cases-1][0] + 96)`, `chr(info[cases-1][1] + 96)`, and `chr(info[cases-1][2] + 96)`; `j` is 2; `i` is `cases - 1`.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `info` still contains the same list of sorted arrays. The variable `i` will be equal to `cases - 1`, indicating that the last array in `info` has been processed. The variable `j` will be 2, having completed the inner loop's three iterations. The variable `temp` will hold the string formed by converting the first three elements of the last array in `info` to their corresponding characters.
