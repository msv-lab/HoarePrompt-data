Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` and then the new `arr`, `i` is `i + 2`, `j` is 2, `arr` is `[]`, `lex` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex < 28:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    elif lex <= 78:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` and then the new `arr`, `i` is `i + 2`, `j` is 0, `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` is less than 28, `lex` is now `lex - 1` and `arr` is `[1]`. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, `arr` is `[26]`. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, `arr` is `[26]`. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` remains `[]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` and then the new `arr`, `i` is `i + 2`, `j` is 1. If `lex` was originally less than 28, `lex` is now `lex - 1` and `arr` is `[1]`. If `lex` was originally between 28 and 51, `lex` is now `lex - 27` and `arr` is `[1, 26]`. If `lex` was originally between 52 and 78, `lex` is now `lex - 52` and `arr` is `[26, 26]`. If `lex` was originally greater than 78, `lex` is now `lex - 104` and `arr` is `[26]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` and then the new `arr`, `i` is `i + 2`, `j` is 2. If `lex` was initially less than 28, `arr` has an additional element `1` appended to it and `lex` is decreased by `1`. If `lex` was initially between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` has `26` appended to it and `lex` is decreased by `26`. If `lex` was initially between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` has `26` appended to it and `lex` is decreased by `26`. If `lex` was initially greater than 78, `arr` remains unchanged and `lex` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
