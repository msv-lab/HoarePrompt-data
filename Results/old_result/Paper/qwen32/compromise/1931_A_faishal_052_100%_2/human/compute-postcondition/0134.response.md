The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 3. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`, where each `arr` is constructed based on the input `lex` values read during each iteration of the loop, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1; `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to `info[i][j] + 96`; `j` is 1**
