The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` would have taken the value 0 (in the first iteration) or 1 (in the second iteration).

To execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented from its current value. Since the loop runs for `j` in the range of 2, the possible values for `j` at the start of each iteration are 0 and 1.

If `j` is currently 0, it will become 1 for the next iteration. If `j` is currently 1, the loop will terminate because the next value would be 2, which is not less than 2.

Given the information, we assume `j` is 0 at the start of the current iteration (since the problem asks for the state at the start of the next iteration, implying there is at least one more iteration to go).

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `lex` is an integer, `arr` contains the integer 1 if lex was initially less than 28, `arr` contains the integer 26 if lex was initially between 28 and 51, `arr` is an empty list if lex was initially 52 or more, `j` is 1**
