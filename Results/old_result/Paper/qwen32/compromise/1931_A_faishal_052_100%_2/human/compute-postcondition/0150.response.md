The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `cases`. If `i` is less than `cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `cases` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 4, and `cases` must still be greater than 4.

State: **`info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`; `temp` is a string containing the characters `chr(info[3][0] + 96)`, `chr(info[3][1] + 96)`, and `chr(info[3][2] + 96)`; `j` is 2; `i` is 4, `cases` must be greater than 4**
