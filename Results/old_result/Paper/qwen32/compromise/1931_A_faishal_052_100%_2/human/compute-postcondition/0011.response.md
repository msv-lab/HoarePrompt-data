Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26, and `lex` is an integer greater than or equal to 28 but less than 52.**

Explanation: The only change is that the list `arr` now contains the integer 26. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
