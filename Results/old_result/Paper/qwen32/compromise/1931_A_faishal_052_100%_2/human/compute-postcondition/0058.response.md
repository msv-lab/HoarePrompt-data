The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. Given that `lex` was initially between 52 and 78, after subtracting 26, `lex` will now be between 26 and 52. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`, `lex` is an integer and its value is greater than or equal to 26 but less than or equal to 52, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr` is [26]**
