In the given for loop, the loop variable is `j`, and the range is `range(2)`. This means the loop will execute exactly twice if the range is correctly defined and non-empty.

Let's analyze the provided state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.
- `cases` must be greater than 0.
- `info` is an empty list.
- `arr` is an empty list.
- `lex` is an input integer.

The only variable in the loop head is `j`, and the range is fixed as `range(2)`. The range `range(2)` is always valid and will produce two iterations (with `j` taking values 0 and 1). Therefore, no adjustment to the loop variables or the range itself is necessary for the loop to execute.

However, the problem specifies that we should only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is just the loop variable `j`. Since `j` is automatically initialized by the `range(2)` in the loop head, there is no need to set an initial value for `j` outside the loop.

Thus, the state before the loop starts does not need to be modified with respect to the loop's execution. The loop will execute as expected with the given range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` must be greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer**
