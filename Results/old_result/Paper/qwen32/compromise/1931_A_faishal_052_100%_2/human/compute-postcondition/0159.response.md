To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code snippet:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`.
   - `temp` is constructed by converting three elements from `info[4]` into characters. Specifically, `temp` is `chr(info[4][0] + 96) + chr(info[4][1] + 96) + chr(info[4][2] + 96)`.
   - `j` is set to 3.
   - `i` is set to 4.
   - `cases` must be greater than 4.

2. **Understanding `temp`:**
   - `temp` is a string composed of three characters.
   - Each character is derived from an element in the array `info[4]` by adding 96 to it and then converting the result to a character using the `chr()` function.
   - For example, if `info[4][0]` is 1, then `chr(1 + 96)` would be `'a'`.

3. **Given Information:**
   - We don't have the exact values of `info[4][0]`, `info[4][1]`, and `info[4][2]`, but we know they are elements of a sorted array within `info`.

4. **Constructing the Output:**
   - Since the exact values of `info[4][0]`, `info[4][1]`, and `info[4][2]` are not provided, we can't determine the exact string `temp` will produce.
   - However, we can describe `temp` in terms of the elements of `info[4]`.

Therefore, the output will be described as follows:

Output: **temp (where temp is constructed as chr(info[4][0] + 96) + chr(info[4][1] + 96) + chr(info[4][2] + 96))**
