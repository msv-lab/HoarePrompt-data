To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state before the for loop starts, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head contains `i` and `cases`.

Here's the analysis:

1. **Variable `i`:** This variable is the loop counter and is initialized automatically by the `range(cases)` function. Therefore, we don't need to explicitly set `i` before the loop starts.

2. **Variable `cases`:** The loop will execute `cases` times. For the loop to execute at least once, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Given the information, the only variable that needs adjustment is `cases`. The state of `info` and the construction of `arr` based on `lex` values are not directly related to the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `cases` is at least 1.

State: **`info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`, where each `arr` is constructed based on the input `lex` values read during each iteration of the loop, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1**.
