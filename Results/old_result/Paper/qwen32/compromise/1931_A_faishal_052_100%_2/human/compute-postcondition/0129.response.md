To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop operates and how it modifies the `info` list over time.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs `cases` times.
- For each iteration, it reads an integer `lex`.
- It then creates an array `arr` and populates it based on the value of `lex`:
  - If `lex < 28`, it appends `1` to `arr` twice and reduces `lex` by `1` each time.
  - If `28 <= lex < 52`, it appends `1` and `26` to `arr` and reduces `lex` by `1` and `26` respectively.
  - If `52 <= lex <= 78`, it appends `26` twice to `arr` and reduces `lex` by `26` twice.
- After populating `arr`, it appends the remaining `lex` to `arr`.
- The `arr` is then sorted and appended to the `info` list.

### Final Output State:
After the loop completes all `cases` iterations, the `info` list will contain `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr` where each `arr` is constructed as described above based on the input `lex` values.

### Format:
Output State: **`info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`, where each `arr` is constructed based on the input `lex` values read during each iteration of the loop.**

### Natural Language Description:
The final output state is that the `info` list contains `cases` number of sorted arrays. Each array `arr` is built by reading an integer `lex` and appending values to `arr` based on the conditions specified in the loop. The array is then sorted in non-decreasing order and added to the `info` list. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `cases` determines the number of iterations and thus the number of arrays in `info`.

Output State: **`info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`, where each `arr` is constructed based on the input `lex` values read during each iteration of the loop.**
