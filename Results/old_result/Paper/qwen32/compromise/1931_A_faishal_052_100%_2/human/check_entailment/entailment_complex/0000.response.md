### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided code to see if it correctly determines the lexicographically smallest word for each given encoded value.

1. **Input Parsing**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases and the encoded value `n` for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The code initializes an empty list `arr` for each test case.
   - It then enters a loop that runs twice to determine the first two letters of the word.
     - If `lex` (the remaining encoded value) is less than 28, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`. This is correct because 'a' corresponds to 1.
     - If `lex` is between 28 and 51, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is correct because 'z' corresponds to 26.
     - If `lex` is between 52 and 78, it again appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is correct for the same reason.
   - After the loop, the remaining value of `lex` is appended to `arr`. This represents the third letter of the word.
   - The array `arr` is then sorted to ensure the letters are in lexicographical order.

3. **Generating the Output**:
   - For each test case, the code converts the numbers in `arr` to their corresponding letters by adding 96 (since 'a' is ASCII 97).
   - These letters are concatenated to form the final word, which is then printed.

### Issues in the Code:
The main issue with the code lies in the logic used to determine the first two letters. Specifically, the conditions in the loop are not correctly handling all possible values of `lex` to ensure the smallest possible letters are chosen. 

For example, if `lex` is 24, the code will append 1 twice and then 22, resulting in "aav". However, the correct smallest word should be "aaa" because the sum of the positions of 'a', 'a', and 'a' is 3, and we need to distribute the remaining sum (21) among the three letters in the smallest possible way.

### Correct Approach:
To ensure the smallest possible word, we should start by assigning the smallest possible values to the first two letters and then adjust the third letter accordingly. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Start with the smallest possible letters
        a = min(lex - 2, 26)  # First letter
        lex -= a
        b = min(lex - 1, 26)  # Second letter
        lex -= b
        c = lex  # Third letter
        print(chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96))

func()
```

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the original code, the provided code does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
