### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to decode an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) back into a lexicographically smallest 3-letter word where each letter is represented by its position in the alphabet (1 for 'a', 26 for 'z').

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex`.

2. **Logic for Determining the Letters:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the values corresponding to the letters of the word.
   - It enters a loop that runs twice:
     - If `lex` is less than 28, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 78, it again appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - The list `arr` is then sorted, and the values are converted to characters by adding 96 and printing the resulting word.

#### Issues Identified:
- The logic for determining the first two letters is flawed. The program does not ensure that the first two letters are the smallest possible while still allowing the third letter to make up the required sum.
- Sorting the list after determining the values does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word. Sorting the list can lead to incorrect results because it does not prioritize minimizing the first letters.

#### Correct Approach:
To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should:
- Start by assigning the smallest possible values to the first two letters.
- Calculate the third letter accordingly, ensuring all values are between 1 and 26.
- Ensure that the sum of the three letters equals `lex`.

#### Example of Correct Logic:
```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Initialize the first two letters to the smallest possible values
        for a in range(1, 27):
            for b in range(1, 27):
                c = lex - a - b
                if 1 <= c <= 26:
                    # Print the lexicographically smallest word
                    print(chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96))
                    break
            else:
                continue
            break
```

#### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the logic of the provided program, it does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for each encoded value. The program's approach of appending values based on thresholds and sorting the list does not ensure the correct result.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
