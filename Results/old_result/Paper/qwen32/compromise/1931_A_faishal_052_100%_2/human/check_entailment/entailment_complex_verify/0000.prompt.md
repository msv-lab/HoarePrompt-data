You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        
        lex = int(input())

    #State: `info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`, where each `arr` is constructed based on the input `lex` values read during each iteration of the loop.

        temp = ''
        
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        
        print(temp)
        
    #State: `info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`; `temp` is a string containing the characters `chr(info[cases-1][0] + 96)`, `chr(info[cases-1][1] + 96)`, and `chr(info[cases-1][2] + 96)`; `j` is 2; `i` is `cases - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `lex` (where 3 ≤ lex ≤ 78), and outputs a string of three characters derived from the processed value of `lex`. For each test case, the function calculates a sequence of numbers based on the value of `lex`, sorts them, and then converts the first three numbers of the sorted sequence into lowercase alphabetic characters by adding 96 to each number and converting to ASCII. The resulting strings are printed one per line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to a given integer `n` (where `3 ≤ n ≤ 78`).
- Each letter in the word corresponds to a position in the alphabet (e.g., 'a' = 1, 'b' = 2, ..., 'z' = 26).

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n`. It then attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums to `n`.

Here is the program again for reference:
```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex < 28:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            elif lex <= 78:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        info.append(arr)
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        print(temp)

func()
```

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Logic for Constructing the Word:**
   - The program incorrectly handles the construction of the word. Specifically, it tries to fill the first two positions with either 1 or 26 based on the value of `lex`, and then assigns the remaining value to the third position.
   - This approach does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word. For example, if `lex` is 27, the program will assign `[26, 1, 1]` instead of `[1, 1, 25]`, which is lexicographically smaller.

2. **Sorting:**
   - Sorting the array `arr` after assigning values ensures that the smallest possible values come first, but the initial assignment logic is flawed.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input `n = 27`. The program will output `bza` (since it assigns `[26, 1, 1]` and sorts it to `[1, 1, 26]` which translates to `bza`). However, the correct output should be `aaa` because `1 + 1 + 25 = 27` and `aaa` is lexicographically smaller than `bza`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all cases correctly, particularly when constructing the lexicographically smallest word. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program fails to ensure that the constructed word is always the lexicographically smallest for all possible values of `n` between 3 and 78. The logic for assigning values to the three positions in the word is flawed, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
