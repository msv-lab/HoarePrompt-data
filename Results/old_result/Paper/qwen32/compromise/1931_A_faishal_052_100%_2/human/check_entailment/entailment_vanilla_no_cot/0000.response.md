Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded value. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Logic for determining the letters**: The program incorrectly handles the logic for breaking down the encoded value into three letters. It does not ensure that the letters are chosen in such a way that they form the lexicographically smallest possible word.

2. **Handling edge cases**: The program does not handle cases where the encoded value is close to the maximum possible sum (78) correctly. It should ensure that the last letter is chosen such that the total sum matches the encoded value.

3. **Sorting the letters**: Sorting the letters after assigning them does not guarantee that the word will be lexicographically smallest. The assignment of letters should be done in a way that respects the order from the start.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        n = int(input())
        # Start with the smallest possible letters
        a = b = c = 1
        # Increase the last letter until the sum matches n
        while a + b + c < n:
            if c < 26:
                c += 1
            elif b < 26:
                b += 1
                c = 1
            else:
                a += 1
                b = 1
                c = 1
        # Convert numbers to letters
        result = chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96)
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the letters are chosen in such a way that they form the lexicographically smallest possible word for the given encoded value.
