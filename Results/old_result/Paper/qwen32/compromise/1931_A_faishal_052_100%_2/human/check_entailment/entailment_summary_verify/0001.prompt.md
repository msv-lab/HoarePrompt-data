You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex < 28:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            elif lex <= 78:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        info.append(arr)
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        print(temp)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `lex` (where 3 ≤ lex ≤ 78), and outputs a string of three characters derived from the processed value of `lex`. For each test case, the function calculates a sequence of numbers based on the value of `lex`, sorts them, and then converts the first three numbers of the sorted sequence into lowercase alphabetic characters by adding 96 to each number and converting to ASCII. The resulting strings are printed one per line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` which represents the encoded value of the word.

2. **Logic for Finding the Lexicographically Smallest Word:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the values corresponding to the letters of the word.
   - It then enters a loop that runs twice (for the first two letters).
     - If `lex` is less than 28, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`. This is incorrect because it should always try to minimize the value of the first letters to ensure the word is lexicographically smallest.
     - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is also incorrect for the same reason.
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 78, it again appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This logic does not guarantee the smallest possible letters.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - The list `arr` is then sorted, which is unnecessary and incorrect because we need to ensure the first letters are minimized first, not just sort the final values.

3. **Generating the Output:**
   - The program converts each value in `arr` to a character by adding 96 (which corresponds to 'a' being 1) and concatenates them to form the word.
   - It prints the resulting word for each test case.

### Issues Identified:
- The logic for determining the first two letters is flawed. It doesn't ensure that the letters are the smallest possible while still allowing the third letter to make up the required sum.
- Sorting the list after determining the values does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word.

### Correct Approach:
- To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should start by assigning the smallest possible values to the first two letters and then calculate the third letter.
- We can iterate over possible values for the first letter, then the second letter, and compute the third letter accordingly, ensuring all values are between 1 and 26.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the logic, the program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for each encoded value.
