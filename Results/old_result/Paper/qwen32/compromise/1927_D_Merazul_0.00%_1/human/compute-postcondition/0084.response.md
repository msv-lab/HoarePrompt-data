Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It also receives an integer `q` and `q` pairs of integers `(l, r)`. The function processes these inputs and returns a list of results for each query, where each result is the sum of the integers in the list `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive).**
