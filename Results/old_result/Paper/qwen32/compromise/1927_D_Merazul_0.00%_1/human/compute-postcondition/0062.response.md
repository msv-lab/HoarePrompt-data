The code snippet `m = n = k // 2` assigns the value of `k // 2` to both `m` and `n`. The initial state indicates that `k` is the last element returned by `R()`, and `m` and `n` were previously set to the count of integers in `a` but not in `b`, and the count of integers in `b` but not in `a`, respectively. After the execution of the code, `m` and `n` will both hold the value of `k // 2`.

Output State: **`f` is 1; `m` is `k // 2`; `n` is `k // 2`; `t` is truthy and decreased by 1; `k` is the last element returned by `R()`. `a` is a set containing the elements returned by `R()`. `b` is a set containing the elements returned by `R()`.**
