To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to analyze the expression `'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2]` step by step based on the given initial state.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `f` is 1 if all integers from 1 to `k` are in either list `a` or list `b`, otherwise `f` is 0.
   - `m` is the count of integers that are in `a` but not in `b`.
   - `n` is the count of integers that are in `b` but not in `a`.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `f ^ 1`: This is a bitwise XOR operation. If `f` is 0, `f ^ 1` will be 1, and if `f` is 1, `f ^ 1` will be 0.
   - `m | n < 0`: This expression involves a bitwise OR operation and a comparison. Since `m` and `n` are counts (non-negative integers), `m | n` will also be a non-negative integer. Comparing a non-negative integer to 0 with `<` will always result in `False` (which is 0 in a boolean context).
   - `f ^ 1 or m | n < 0`: The `or` operator evaluates the first operand. If `f ^ 1` is non-zero (True), it returns `f ^ 1`. If `f ^ 1` is zero (False), it evaluates and returns `m | n < 0`, which is always `False` (0).
   - `f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2`: This is a slicing operation on the string `'YNEOS'`. The start index of the slice is determined by the result of `f ^ 1 or m | n < 0`, and the step is 2.

3. **Determining the Output:**
   - If `f` is 0, then `f ^ 1` is 1, so the start index is 1.
   - If `f` is 1, then `f ^ 1` is 0, so the start index is 0.
   - The step is 2, so the slicing will take every second character starting from the determined index.

4. **Possible Outputs:**
   - If `f` is 0, the slice is `'YNEOS'[1::2]`, which results in `'EO'`.
   - If `f` is 1, the slice is `'YNEOS'[0::2]`, which results in `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The output depends on the value of `f`. Since `f` is either 0 or 1, the output will be either `'EO'` or `'YES'`.

Output: **'YES' if f is 1, otherwise 'EO'**
