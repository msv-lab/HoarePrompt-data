### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided program and its logic to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself. The string `s` consists of '+' and '-' characters. The program then counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `neg`.

The key part of the program is the output statement:
```python
print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)
```
This means that if the number of '-' characters (`neg`) is not equal to the total length of the string (`n`), it prints `n - 2 * neg`. Otherwise, it prints `n`.

Let's consider the logic behind this output statement:
- If the string `s` contains any '+' characters, then `n - 2 * neg` is the correct output. This is because:
  - `n` is the total length of the string.
  - `2 * neg` accounts for the penalty of splitting the string into subarrays where each subarray has a sum of 0. Each pair of '+' and '-' can be grouped together to form a subarray with a sum of 0, and the penalty for such a subarray is 0.
  - Therefore, `n - 2 * neg` gives the minimum penalty by maximizing the number of subarrays with a sum of 0.
- If the string `s` contains only '-' characters, then `n - 2 * neg` would be 0, which is incorrect. In this case, the correct output should be `n` because the only way to split the array is to have each '-' character in its own subarray, and the penalty for each subarray is 1.
- Similarly, if the string `s` contains only '+' characters, then `n - 2 * neg` is `n`, which is correct because the only way to split the array is to have each '+' character in its own subarray, and the penalty for each subarray is 1.

Thus, the output statement correctly handles all cases:
- When the string contains both '+' and '-' characters, the output is `n - 2 * neg`.
- When the string contains only '-' characters, the output is `n`.
- When the string contains only '+' characters, the output is `n`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty based on the given problem description and input-output examples.

Correctness: **True**
