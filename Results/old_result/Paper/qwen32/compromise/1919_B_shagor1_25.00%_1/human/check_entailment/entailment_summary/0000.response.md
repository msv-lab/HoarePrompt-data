### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its logic in the context of the problem statement.

The goal is to split the array `a` derived from the string `s` into subarrays such that the sum of penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The penalty of a subarray is calculated as the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length.

The provided program calculates the result as `n - 2 * neg` if there are any '+' characters in the string, otherwise it prints `n`, where `neg` is the count of '-' characters in `s`.

However, this logic does not align with the optimal strategy to minimize the penalty. Here's why:

1. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The optimal way to minimize the penalty is to try to balance the subarrays such that their sums are close to zero. This is because the penalty is the absolute value of the sum multiplied by the length, and smaller sums (preferably zero) lead to smaller penalties.
   - For example, in the third test case, the optimal split is `([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1])` leading to a penalty of `0`.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program simply calculates `n - 2 * neg` if there are any '+' characters. This formula does not consider any balancing of subarrays and does not guarantee the minimum penalty.
   - For example, in the third test case (`s = "+-+-+-"`), the program calculates `6 - 2 * 3 = 0`, which happens to be correct for this specific case but is not a general solution.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy to minimize the penalty for all possible inputs. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
