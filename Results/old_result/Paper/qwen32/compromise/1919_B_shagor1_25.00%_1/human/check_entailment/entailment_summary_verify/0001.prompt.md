You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-". s
represents an array a of length n defined by a_i=1 if s_i= "+" and a_i=-1 if
s_i= "-".

You will do the following process to calculate your penalty:

  1. Split a into non-empty arrays b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k such that b_1+b_2+\ldots+b_k=a^\dagger , where + denotes array concatenation. 
  2. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In other words, for some array c of length m , its penalty is calculated as p(c)=|c_1+c_2+\ldots+c_m| \cdot m . 
  3. The total penalty that you will receive is p(b_1)+p(b_2)+\ldots+p(b_k) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger Some valid ways to split a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k) are
([3],[1],[4],[1],[5]) , ([3,1],[4,1,5]) and ([3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,1],[1,5]) , ([3],[\,],[1,4],[1,5]) and ([3,4],[5,1,1])
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the length of string s .

The second line of each test case contains string s (s_i \in \\{ \mathtt{+},
\mathtt{-} \\} , |s| = n ).

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Note

In the first test case, we have a=[1] . We can split array a into ([1]) .
Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is p([1]) = 1 .

In the second test case, we have a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] . We can split array a
into ([-1],[-1],[-1],[-1],[-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays
is p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 .

In the third test case, we have a=[1,-1,1,-1,1,-1] . We can split array a into
([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is
p([1,-1,1,-1]) + p([1,-1]) = 0 + 0 = 0 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    func_1()
    t -= 1

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    neg = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '-':
            neg += 1
    print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-' characters. It calculates and prints the result as `n - 2 * neg` if there are any '+' characters in the string, otherwise it prints `n`, where `neg` is the count of '-' characters in `s`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to split the given string `s` into non-empty subarrays such that the sum of penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length.

The string `s` consists of characters `+` and `-`. Each `+` corresponds to `1` and each `-` corresponds to `-1`. We need to find an optimal way to split the array derived from `s` to minimize the total penalty.

### Key Observations

1. **Subarray Sum Penalty**: The penalty for a subarray is given by `|sum(subarray)| * len(subarray)`. To minimize the penalty, ideally, we want subarrays where the sum is `0` because `|0| * len(subarray) = 0`.

2. **Optimal Splitting Strategy**: The optimal strategy is to find the longest possible subarrays where the sum is `0`. If we can't achieve a sum of `0`, we should aim for the smallest possible absolute sum.

3. **Counting `+` and `-`**: The number of `+` and `-` in the string `s` determines how we can balance the subarrays. If the counts of `+` and `-` are equal, we can potentially split the array into subarrays with a sum of `0`. If they are not equal, we need to account for the imbalance.

### Program Analysis

Let's analyze the provided program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    func_1()
    t -= 1

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    neg = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '-':
            neg += 1
    print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)
```

1. **Counting `-` Characters**: The program counts the number of `-` characters in the string `s`.

2. **Calculating Penalty**: The penalty is calculated using the formula `n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n`. This formula is derived from the observation that the penalty can be minimized by balancing the counts of `+` and `-`.

   - If `n == neg`, it means the string consists entirely of `-` characters. In this case, the penalty is simply `n` because we can't balance the array to have a sum of `0`.
   - If `n != neg`, the formula `n - 2 * neg` attempts to balance the counts of `+` and `-` to minimize the penalty.

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `+`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: `n = 1`, `neg = 0`. The penalty is `1 - 2 * 0 = 1`.

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `-----`
   - Output: `5`
   - Explanation: `n = 5`, `neg = 5`. The penalty is `5` (since `n == neg`).

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `+-+-+-`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: `n = 6`, `neg = 3`. The penalty is `6 - 2 * 3 = 0`.

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `--+++++++`
   - Output: `4`
   - Explanation: `n = 10`, `neg = 2`. The penalty is `10 - 2 * 2 = 6` (This seems incorrect based on the expected output `4`).

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: `+---++++-+++++---++-`
   - Output: `4`
   - Explanation: `n = 20`, `neg = 8`. The penalty is `20 - 2 * 8 = 4`.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum penalty for all test cases. Specifically, the formula `n - 2 * neg` does not always yield the correct result for all possible inputs. The optimal splitting strategy is more complex and involves dynamic programming or a greedy approach to balance the subarrays optimally.

### Final Answer

Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum penalty for all test cases. The formula used (`n - 2 * neg`) does not account for all optimal splitting scenarios.
Correctness: **False**
