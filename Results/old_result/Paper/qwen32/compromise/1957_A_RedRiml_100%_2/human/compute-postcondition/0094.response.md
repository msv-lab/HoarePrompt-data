Postcondition: **`w` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is the new input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least 1 integer. If `i` was not in `pl`, then `pl` now contains the single element `i` and `shapes` is 0. If `i` was not in `pl` and `d.get(i)` was `None`, `d` is now `{i: 1}`. If `i` was not in `pl` and `d.get(i)` was not `None`, `d[i]` is incremented by 1. If `i` was already in `pl`, the state of `pl` and `shapes` remains unchanged.**
