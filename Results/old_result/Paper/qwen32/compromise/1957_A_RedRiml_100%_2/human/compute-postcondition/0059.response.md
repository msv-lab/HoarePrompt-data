The code snippet `pl.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the list `pl`. This means that `pl` will now contain the previous elements of `pl` plus the new element `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `w` must be between 0 and 99 inclusive.
- `ln` is an input integer.
- `palka` is a list of integers obtained from new input and must have at least one element.
- `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is either `1` if it was `None` before, or incremented by `1` if it was already present.
- `pl` contains the current value of `i` if it was not in `pl` before.
- `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.
- `i` is the next element in `palka`.

After executing `pl.append(i)`, the list `pl` will have an additional element, which is the current value of `i`.

Output State: **`w` must be between 0 and 99 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from new input and must have at least one element, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is either `1` if it was `None` before, or incremented by `1` if it was already present, `pl` contains the current value of `i` and possibly other elements, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`, `i` is the next element in `palka`.**
