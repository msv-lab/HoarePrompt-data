Postcondition: **`w` must be between 0 and 99 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must have at least one element, `d` is a dictionary where if `d.get(i)` was `None`, `d[i]` is set to `1`. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by `1`. If `i` was not in `pl` before the if statement, `pl` now contains the current value of `i`. `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.**
