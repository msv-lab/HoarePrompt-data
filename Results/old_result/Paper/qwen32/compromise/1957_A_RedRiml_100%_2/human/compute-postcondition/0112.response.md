Postcondition: **`w` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is the new input integer, `palka` is the list of integers from the new input, `pl` is a list of all unique integers from `palka` and has at least 1 element, `d` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `palka` and values as their respective counts, `j` is the first element in `pl`. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3`. Otherwise, `shapes` remains unchanged.**
