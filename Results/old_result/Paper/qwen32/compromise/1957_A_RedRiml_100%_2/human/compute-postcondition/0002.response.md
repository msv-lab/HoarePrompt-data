`ln` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `w` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` must be between 1 and 100 inclusive, and `ln` is an input integer.

Output State: **`w` must be between 1 and 100 inclusive; `ln` is an input integer**.
