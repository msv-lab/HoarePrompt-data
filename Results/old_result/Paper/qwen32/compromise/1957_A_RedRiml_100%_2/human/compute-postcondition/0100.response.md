Postcondition: **`w` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is the new input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the next element in `palka`, and `d` is a dictionary. If `d` did not have the key `i` before the execution, it now has the key `i` with the value `1`. If `d` already had the key `i`, its value is incremented by 1. Additionally, if `i` was not in `pl` before the execution, `pl` now includes `i` as its last element.**
