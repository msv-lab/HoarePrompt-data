Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of sticks, followed by a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks. The function returns "yes" if it is possible to form a triangle with any three sticks from the list; otherwise, it returns "no".**
