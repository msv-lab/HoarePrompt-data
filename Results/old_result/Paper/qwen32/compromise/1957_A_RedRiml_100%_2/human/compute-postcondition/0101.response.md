The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the list `palka`. Therefore, we need to adjust these states for the loop to execute another iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the next element in `palka`, and `palka` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least 1 integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `palka` must have at least one more element after `i`.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:
- `i` should be the next element in `palka` after the current `i`.
- `palka` should have at least one more element.

Since we don't have the specific values of `palka` and `i`, we can generalize the state as follows:
- `i` will be the next element in `palka` after the current `i`.
- `palka` must have at least one more element than the current `palka`.

State: **`w` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is the new input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`, and `d` is a dictionary. If `d` did not have the key `i` before the execution, it now has the key `i` with the value `1`. If `d` already had the key `i`, its value is incremented by 1. Additionally, if `i` was not in `pl` before the execution, `pl` now includes `i` as its last element.**
