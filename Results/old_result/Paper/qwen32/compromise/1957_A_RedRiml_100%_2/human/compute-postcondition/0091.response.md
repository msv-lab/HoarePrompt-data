Postcondition: **`w` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is the new input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is an empty list, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`. If `d.get(i)` was `None`, `d` is now `{i: 1}`. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by 1 and `d.get(i)` is not `None`.**
