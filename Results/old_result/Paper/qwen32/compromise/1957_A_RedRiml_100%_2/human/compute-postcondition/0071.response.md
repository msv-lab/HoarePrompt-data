The value of `shapes` is incremented by the integer division of `d[j]` by 3. Since `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `d[j] // 3` will be a positive integer. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`w` is between 0 and 99 inclusive, `ln` is the input integer, `palka` is the list of integers from the input, `pl` is a list of unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 1 element, `d` is a dictionary with counts of each unique integer from `palka`, and `shapes` is the previous value of `shapes` plus `d[j] // 3`.**
