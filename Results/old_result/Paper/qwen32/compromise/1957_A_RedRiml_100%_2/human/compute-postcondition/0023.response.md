The code snippet `d[i] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. 

Given the initial state, `i` is the next element in the list `palka`, and `d` is a dictionary that either already contains `i` with a value or will have `i` added with an initial value of 1 if `i` was not present initially.

After executing `d[i] += 1`, the value of `d[i]` will be incremented by 1. The values of `w`, `ln`, `palka`, and `pl` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`w` must be between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 integers, `pl` is a list that contains the element `i`, and `d` is a dictionary where the value associated with the key `i` has been incremented by 1.**
