The code `d[i] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. The values of `w`, `ln`, `palka`, and `i` remain unchanged, except for the dictionary `d` which now includes the key `i` with the value `1`.

Output State: **`w` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is the new input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the next element in `palka`, `d` is a dictionary with the key `i` having the value `1`.**
