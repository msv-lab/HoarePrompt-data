Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `w` must be between 1 and 100 inclusive; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `pl` is an empty list; `d` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `w` must be between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is a list that may or may not contain the element `i` (if `i` was not in `pl` initially, it is now added), and `d` is a dictionary. If `i` was not in `pl` initially, `i` is now in `pl`. If `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, `d` now contains a new key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is `1`. Otherwise, `d` already contains the key `i` and the value associated with `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `w` must be between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 integers, `pl` is a list that contains the element `i`, and `d` is a dictionary. If `i` was not in `d` initially, `d` contains a new key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is `1`. Otherwise, the value associated with the key `i` in `d` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `w` must be between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 integers, `pl` is a list. If `i` was not in `pl` initially, `pl` contains the element `i` twice. If `i` was not in `d` initially, `d` contains a new key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is `1`. Otherwise, the value associated with the key `i` in `d` is incremented by 1. If `i` was already in `pl`, no changes are made to `pl` or `d`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
