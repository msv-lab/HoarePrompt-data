Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `w` must be between 0 and 99 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `w` must be between 0 and 99 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must have at least one element, `d` is a dictionary where if `d.get(i)` was `None`, `d[i]` is set to `1`. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by `1`. If `i` was not in `pl` before the if statement, `pl` now contains the current value of `i`. `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `w` must be between 0 and 99 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from new input and must have at least one element, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is either `1` if it was `None` before, or incremented by `1` if it was already present, `pl` contains the current value of `i` if `i` was not already in `pl`, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`, and `i` is the next element in `palka`. If `i` was not in `pl`, `pl` now includes `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `w` is between 0 and 99 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from new input and must have at least one element, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is `1` if it was `None` before, or incremented by `1` if it was already present. If `i` was not already in `pl`, `pl` now includes `i` and `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`. If `i` was already in `pl`, `d[i]` is incremented by `1` but `pl` and `shapes` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
