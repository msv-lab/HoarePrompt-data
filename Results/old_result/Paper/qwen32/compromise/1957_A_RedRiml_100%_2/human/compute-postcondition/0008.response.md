The code snippet `d[i] = 1` adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary `d` where the key is `i` and the value is `1`. Since there is no prior information about the value of `i`, we can only state that `d` now contains this new key-value pair. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`w` must be between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with a new key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is `1`.**
