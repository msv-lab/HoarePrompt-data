The code snippet `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]` assigns the first element of the list `nums` to the element at index `i - 1` in the list `arr`.

Given the initial state, the value of `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `nums[0]`. No other variables are changed by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99; `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers created from the input line where each integer satisfies 0 <= integer <= 99, and `arr[i - 1]` is now `nums[0]`; `i` is decreased by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans`.**
