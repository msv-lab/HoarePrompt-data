To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state. 

The code snippet is:
```python
print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

This line of code uses a list `['NO', 'YES']` and accesses an element of this list using the index `ans`. The output will be either `'NO'` or `'YES'` depending on the value of `ans`.

Since the initial state does not provide the value of `ans`, we cannot determine the exact output (either `'NO'` or `'YES'`). However, we can describe the possible outcomes based on the value of `ans`.

- If `ans` is `0`, the output will be `'NO'` because `['NO', 'YES'][0]` is `'NO'`.
- If `ans` is `1`, the output will be `'YES'` because `['NO', 'YES'][1]` is `'YES'`.

Given that we do not have the value of `ans`, the most precise description is that the output will be either `'NO'` or `'YES'` depending on the value of `ans`.

Output: **['NO', 'YES'][ans] (where ans is an integer index that determines whether 'NO' or 'YES' is printed)**
