Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is an input integer; `arr` is a potentially modified list of integers where each integer satisfies 0 <= integer <= 99, with modifications based on the loop's logic; `ans` is a boolean that is `False` if any `nums` was not sorted during the loop, otherwise `True`.**

Explanation: The code only changes the value of `m` by reading a new input integer. All other variables remain unchanged.
