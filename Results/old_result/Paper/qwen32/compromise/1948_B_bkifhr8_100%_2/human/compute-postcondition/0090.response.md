Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers. For each test case, it determines if the list can be transformed into a non-decreasing sequence by repeatedly replacing a pair of adjacent elements where the first is greater than the second, with a new element formed by concatenating the digits of the first element and the second element, followed by sorting the resulting digits. It prints 'YES' if such a transformation is possible for the list, otherwise it prints 'NO'.**
