The code snippet `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]` updates the value of `arr[i - 1]` to be the first element of the list `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this assignment.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99.
- `m` is the new input integer and must be at least 2.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `i` is `i - 1`.
- `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`, specifically `nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]`.
- `ans` is False if `nums` is not sorted, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged. If `nums` is not sorted, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

After executing `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]`:
- `arr[i - 1]` is updated to the first element of `nums`.

Since `nums` is a list where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]`, `nums[0]` is the first digit of the integer `arr[i - 1]`. Therefore, `arr[i - 1]` is now set to this first digit.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99; `m` is the new input integer and must be at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input with `arr[i - 1]` updated to `nums[0]`; `i` is `i - 1`; `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`; `ans` is False if `nums` is not sorted, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.**
