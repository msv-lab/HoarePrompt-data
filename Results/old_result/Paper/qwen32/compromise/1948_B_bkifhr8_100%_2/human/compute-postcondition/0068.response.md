Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is the new input integer and must be at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `ans` is False. At the current index `i`, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`; `nums` is a list of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and `nums` is not sorted. The loop or if statement is broken out of.`**

In natural language: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `arr`, `ans`, `i`, and `nums` remain unchanged. The only change is that the loop or if statement is exited.
