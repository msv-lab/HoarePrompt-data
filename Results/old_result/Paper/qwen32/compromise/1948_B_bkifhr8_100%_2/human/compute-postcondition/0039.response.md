Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input where each integer satisfies 0 <= integer <= 99 and the current integer at index `i` is less than the integer at index `i - 1`; `ans` is `False`; `nums` is a list consisting of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. The list `nums` is not sorted; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only exits the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values, and the only addition is that we break out of the loop or if statement.
