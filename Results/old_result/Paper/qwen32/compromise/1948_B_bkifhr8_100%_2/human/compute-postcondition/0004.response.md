The code snippet provided simply initializes a variable `ans` to `True`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `arr`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers created from the input line where each integer satisfies 0 <= integer <= 99; `ans` is True.**
