### Reasoning:
The provided code attempts to determine if a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly performing the specified operation. However, the logic in the code is flawed and does not correctly implement the required operation.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Operation Implementation**:
   - The code checks if an element is less than the previous one and then tries to split the previous element and check if the resulting array is sorted. This is not the correct operation as per the problem statement.
   - The correct operation is to split any element that is at least 10 into its digits and insert those digits in place of the element. The code does not perform this operation iteratively on all elements.

2. **Logic to Determine Sortability**:
   - The code's logic to determine if the array can be sorted is incorrect. It only checks if the array can be made sorted by a single operation on adjacent elements, which is not sufficient.
   - The problem requires checking if the array can be transformed into a sorted array by performing the operation any number of times, possibly zero.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The outer loop correctly processes multiple test cases, but the inner logic for each test case is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the logic and implementation, the provided code is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**

To fix this, the code should iteratively apply the operation to any element that is at least 10, and then check if the array can be sorted. This would involve a more complex algorithm that repeatedly modifies the array until no more operations can be performed, and then checks if the array is sorted.
