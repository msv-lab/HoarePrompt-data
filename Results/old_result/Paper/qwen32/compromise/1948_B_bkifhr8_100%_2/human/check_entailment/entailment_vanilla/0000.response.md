Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- We have an array `a` of integers.
- We can split any element `a_i` that is at least 10 into its digits and insert them in the same position.
- The goal is to determine if we can sort the array in non-decreasing order using the above operation any number of times.

### Program Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve this problem by iterating through the array from the end to the beginning. For each pair of adjacent elements, if the latter is smaller than the former, it tries to split the larger element and checks if the resulting array (after the split and insertion) is sorted.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Splitting and Insertion Logic**: The program attempts to split `arr[i-1]` when `arr[i] < arr[i-1]`. However, it only checks if the array `[int(i) for i in str(arr[i-1])] + [arr[i]]` is sorted, which is not a valid operation since it's only checking a partial sequence and not the entire array after the split.

2. **Incomplete Splitting**: The program only splits `arr[i-1]` and checks a small part of the array, but it doesn't actually perform the split in the array or continue checking the rest of the array.

3. **No Proper Handling of Multiple Splits**: The program does not handle the case where multiple splits might be necessary to achieve a sorted array. It only checks one possible split at a time.

4. **Incorrect Assumption**: The program assumes that if a single split can make a small part of the array sorted, then the entire array can be sorted, which is not necessarily true.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
- Iterate through the array and identify elements that are at least 10.
- Split these elements into their digits and insert them back into the array.
- Continuously check if the array is sorted after each possible split.
- If the array becomes sorted after a series of splits, return "YES". Otherwise, return "NO".

### Conclusion:
Given the issues mentioned above, the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if the array can be sorted using the described operation. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
