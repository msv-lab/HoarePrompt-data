Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We are given an integer array `a` of length `n`.
- We can perform an operation where we take any element of the array `a` that is at least 10, delete it, and instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in order they appear in that element.
- The task is to determine if it is possible to make the array sorted in non-descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array from the end to the beginning and checking if the current element is less than the previous one. If it is, it tries to split the previous element and check if the resulting sequence can be sorted. However, the logic is flawed as outlined in the original assessment.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Transformation Logic**:
   - The code only checks if the current element and the previous element can be transformed such that they form a non-decreasing sequence after splitting the previous element. However, this logic does not consider the possibility of transforming multiple elements or the correct sequence of transformations needed to sort the entire array.

2. **Checking Sorted Order**:
   - The code checks if the array can be transformed into a non-decreasing order by only considering adjacent elements and their immediate transformations. This is insufficient because the transformation can affect multiple elements and the order of transformations can be complex.

3. **Incorrect Transformation Handling**:
   - The code attempts to transform the array by splitting the previous element and checking if the resulting sequence is sorted. However, it does not handle the case where multiple elements need to be transformed, and the transformations need to be applied in a specific order to achieve a sorted array.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where the array requires multiple transformations to be sorted. For example, consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. The code correctly splits `12` to `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, but it does not handle cases where further transformations are needed to sort the array. For example, the array `[34, 12, 56]` should be transformed to `[3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 6]` to be sorted, but the code does not handle such cases.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the counterexample provided in the original assessment:
- **Input**:
  ```
  1
  3
  34 12 56
  ```
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  YES
  ```
- **Actual Output**:
  ```
  NO
  ```

In this example, the array `[34, 12, 56]` can be transformed to `[3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 6]` and then sorted to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. However, the code does not handle this transformation correctly and outputs `NO`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly handle the transformation and sorting logic as described in the problem statement. The logic for transforming the array and checking if it can be sorted is flawed, and the program does not handle the necessary transformations correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
