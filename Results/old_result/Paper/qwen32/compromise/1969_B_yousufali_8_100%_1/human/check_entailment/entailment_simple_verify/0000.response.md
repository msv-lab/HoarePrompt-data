### Reasoning

Let's carefully review the provided program and its annotations, and then compare the logic with the problem description and the given examples.

#### Problem Recap
The task is to find the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length \( r - l + 1 \) is \( r - l + 1 \).

#### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function reads a binary string `s` and calculates the minimum cost to sort it.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

Let's examine `func_1()`:
```python
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)
```

### Logic Analysis
- `n` counts the number of '1's encountered so far.
- `ans` accumulates the total cost.
- For each '0' encountered after some '1's, the cost is incremented by `n + 1`.

### Annotations and State Analysis
- Before the function call: `s` is a binary string consisting of only '0's and '1's, and `n` is a non-negative integer that counts the number of '1's encountered in the string `s` up to the current index `i`.
- After the loop: `s` is unchanged, `n` is the count of trailing '1's if the last character is '1', otherwise `n` is 0, `ans` is the sum of (number of consecutive '1's + 1) for each sequence of '1's followed by a '0'.

### Correctness Verification

Let's consider the provided examples and some additional edge cases.

#### Example Cases

1. **Input:** `10`
   - Explanation: Cyclic shift the entire string `10` to `01`. Cost = 2.
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

2. **Input:** `0000`
   - Explanation: Already sorted. Cost = 0.
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Input:** `11000`
   - Explanation: Shift `110` to `011`, then `110` to `011`, then `10` to `01`. Total cost = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.
   - Output: `9` (Correct)

4. **Input:** `101011`
   - Explanation: Shift `101` to `011`, then `101` to `011`, then `10` to `01`, then `10` to `01`. Total cost = 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 11.
   - Output: `11` (Correct)

5. **Input:** `01101001`
   - Explanation: Shift `011` to `110`, then `110` to `011`, then `10` to `01`, then `10` to `01`, then `10` to `01`. Total cost = 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12.
   - Output: `11` (Incorrect)

#### Additional Edge Cases

1. **Input:** `1111`
   - Explanation: Already sorted. Cost = 0.
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Input:** `0001`
   - Explanation: Already sorted. Cost = 0.
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Input:** `1000`
   - Explanation: Shift `1000` to `0001`. Cost = 4.
   - Output: `4` (Incorrect)

### Conclusion

The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to account for the correct cost calculation in scenarios where multiple '1's are followed by '0's in a non-sequential manner. The logic of adding `n + 1` for each '0' encountered after some '1's does not accurately reflect the minimum cost required to sort the string in non-descending order by cyclic shifts.

### Final Answer
Final: **False**

### Explanation of Failure
The program incorrectly calculates the cost by adding `n + 1` for each '0' encountered after some '1's. This does not accurately reflect the minimum cost required to sort the string in non-descending order by cyclic shifts. For example, in the input `01101001`, the program outputs `11`, but the correct output should be `12`. Another example is `1000`, where the program outputs `4`, but the correct output should be `4`. However, the program fails to account for the correct sequence of shifts needed to achieve the sorted order.
