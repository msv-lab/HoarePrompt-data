Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to ensure the correctness of the assessment.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of a cyclic shift operation on a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

### Key Observations:
1. **Sorting a Binary String**: A binary string is sorted in non-descending order if all `0`s are to the left of all `1`s.
2. **Cyclic Shifts**: Performing a cyclic shift on a substring can move `1`s to the left and `0`s to the right, but the key is to understand how the cost is associated with these shifts.

### Cost Calculation:
- **Counting `1`s**: When we encounter a `0` in the string after encountering a `1`, it implies that this `0` needs to be moved to the left of the `1`s. The cost to move this `0` is equivalent to the number of `1`s encountered so far plus one (to account for the shift operation).
- **Summing Costs**: The total cost is the sum of the costs of moving each `0` encountered after the first `1`.

### Program Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - It reads a binary string `s`.
  - It initializes `n` (count of `1`s encountered) and `ans` (total cost).
  - It iterates through the string:
    - If it encounters a `1`, it increments `n`.
    - If it encounters a `0` and `n` is not zero (meaning there have been `1`s before), it adds `n + 1` to `ans` (the cost to move this `0` to the left of the `1`s).
  - It prints the total cost `ans`.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - It calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Correctness Verification:
The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string by counting the cost of moving each `0` encountered after the first `1`. This aligns with the problem's requirement to minimize the total cost of cyclic shifts.

Let's validate this with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `10`
   - Output: `2`
   - Explanation: The cost to move the `0` to the left of the `1` is `1 + 1 = 2`.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `0000`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: The string is already sorted.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `11000`
   - Output: `9`
   - Explanation: The cost to move the first `0` is `2 + 1 = 3`, the second `0` is `2 + 1 = 3`, and the third `0` is `2 + 1 = 3`. Total cost is `3 + 3 + 3 = 9`.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `101011`
   - Output: `5`
   - Explanation: The cost to move the first `0` is `1 + 1 = 2`, the second `0` is `2 + 1 = 3`. Total cost is `2 + 3 = 5`.

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: `01101001`
   - Output: `11`
   - Explanation: The cost to move the first `0` is `1 + 1 = 2`, the second `0` is `3 + 1 = 4`, the third `0` is `3 + 1 = 4`. Total cost is `2 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 11`.

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum cost for each example. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts.

Reasoning: The program correctly calculates the minimum cost by summing up the costs of moving each `0` encountered after the first `1` in the string, which corresponds to the number of `1`s encountered so far plus one.

Final: **True**
