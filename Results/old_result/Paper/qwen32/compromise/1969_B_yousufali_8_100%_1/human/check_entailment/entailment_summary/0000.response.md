Reasoning:
The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. The main function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by calling `func_1`. The function `func_1` calculates the minimum cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by using a specific strategy.

The strategy used in `func_1` is as follows:
- It initializes a counter `n` to keep track of the number of consecutive '1's encountered.
- It also initializes a variable `ans` to accumulate the total cost.
- As it iterates through the string, it increments `n` each time it encounters a '1'.
- When it encounters a '0' and `n` is not zero (meaning there were '1's before this '0'), it adds `n + 1` to `ans`. The `n + 1` represents the cost of cyclically shifting the substring that ends with the current '0' and starts from the first '1' encountered since the last '0'.

The key point here is that the cost calculation in `func_1` aligns with the problem description. The cost `r - l + 1` is equivalent to `n + 1` in the context of the function, where `n` is the number of '1's that need to be shifted to be before the current '0'. This effectively calculates the minimum cost to sort the string by moving groups of '1's to the left of '0's.

The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case, which is consistent with the problem statement.

Therefore, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
