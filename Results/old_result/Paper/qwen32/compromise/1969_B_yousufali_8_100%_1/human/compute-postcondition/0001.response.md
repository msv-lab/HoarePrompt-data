The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which determines how many times the loop will execute. The state of `t` is the only one we can adjust to ensure the loop executes.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The loop body is omitted, so we do not need to consider any variables or states inside the loop body.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
