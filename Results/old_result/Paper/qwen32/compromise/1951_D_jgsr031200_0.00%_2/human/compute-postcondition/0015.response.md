Given the initial state:
- `n` is 0
- `k` is unchanged (its value is not specified, but it is mentioned that `h` is less than `k`)
- `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`
- `h` is less than `k`

The Python code snippet is:
```python
print('NO')
```

The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`, regardless of the values of `n`, `k`, `costs`, or `h`.

Output: **NO**
