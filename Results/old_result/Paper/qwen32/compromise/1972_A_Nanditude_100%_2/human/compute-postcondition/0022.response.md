To determine the output of the `print(cnt)` statement, we need to understand the context and the variables involved:

1. **`t`**: The number of test cases. It is greater than 0, but it does not directly affect the value of `cnt` in a single execution of the provided code snippet.
2. **`n`**: The number of elements in the lists `a` and `b`. It is greater than 0.
3. **`a`**: A list of integers obtained from an input line.
4. **`b`**: Another list of integers obtained from an input line.
5. **`cnt`**: This variable counts the number of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a` as the loop progresses.
6. **`i`**: The final index in `a` that has been considered. However, `i` is not directly used in the `print(cnt)` statement.

The `cnt` variable is incremented each time an element in `b` is found to be less than the corresponding element in `a`. The exact value of `cnt` depends on the specific values in `a` and `b`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `cnt`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the `print(cnt)` statement will output the final value of `cnt` after the loop has processed all elements in `a` and `b`.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the number of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a`)**
