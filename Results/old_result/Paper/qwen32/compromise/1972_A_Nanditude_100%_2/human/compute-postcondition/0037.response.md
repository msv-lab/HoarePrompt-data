The code snippet `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The initial state specifies that `i` is either 0 or 1. Therefore, after the increment, `i` will be either 1 or 2.

Other variables such as `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `cnt`, and `j` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the new input line. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, `cnt` is 1 and `i` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `i` is 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `i` is increased by 1.**
