The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line.**
