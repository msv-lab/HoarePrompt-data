Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer and is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line; `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line; `j` is 2. If `b[j] < a[i]`, then `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1; `i` is increased by 1.**

In simple terms: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
