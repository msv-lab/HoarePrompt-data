The code snippet `cnt += 1` increments the value of the variable `cnt` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `j`) are not affected by this operation. Since `cnt` was initially 0, it will now be 1. The condition `b[j] < a[i]` remains valid as it was not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is `t + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line, `b` is a new list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the new input line, `cnt` is 1, `i` is 0, and the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`.**
