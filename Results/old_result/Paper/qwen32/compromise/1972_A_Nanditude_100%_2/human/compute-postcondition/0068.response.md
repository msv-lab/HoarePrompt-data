Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of problems, a sorted list `a` of `n` integers representing the difficulties of the proposed problems, and a sorted list `b` of `n` integers representing the expected maximum difficulties of the problems. The function returns a result for each test case indicating whether the proposed problems meet the expected maximum difficulties.**
