The code snippet `cnt += 1` increases the value of the variable `cnt` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `j`, `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer and is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line; `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line; `j` is 2; `cnt` is increased by 1.**
