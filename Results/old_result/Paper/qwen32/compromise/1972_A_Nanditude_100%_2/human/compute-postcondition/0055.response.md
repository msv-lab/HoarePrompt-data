Output State: **`t` is `t + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line, `b` is a new list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the new input line, `cnt` is 0, and `i` is 1. Additionally, `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
