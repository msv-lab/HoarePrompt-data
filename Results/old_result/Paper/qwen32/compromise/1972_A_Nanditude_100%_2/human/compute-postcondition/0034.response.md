Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the new input line. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, `cnt` is 1 and `i` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `i` is 1.**
