The code snippet `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the new input line, `cnt` is 1, `i` is 0, and `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`**.
