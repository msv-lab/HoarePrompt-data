The value of `h` is incremented by 1. Given the initial conditions, `h` is initially 1 if `j` is 'A', otherwise `h` is 2. After incrementing, if `j` was 'A', `h` becomes 2; if `j` was not 'A', `h` becomes 3.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32, `i` is 2, `a` is a non-empty string, `j` is the third character in `a`, `l` is 2 if `j` is 'A', otherwise `l` is 1, and `h` is 2 if `j` is 'A', otherwise `h` is 3.**
