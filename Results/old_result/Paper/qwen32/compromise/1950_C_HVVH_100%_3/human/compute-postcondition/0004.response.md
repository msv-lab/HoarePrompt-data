Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case is a string `s` of length 5 in the format "hh:mm". It returns a result for each test case indicating whether the given time is valid (i.e., hours between 00 and 23 and minutes between 00 and 59). If the time is valid, it returns "Valid"; otherwise, it returns "Invalid".**
