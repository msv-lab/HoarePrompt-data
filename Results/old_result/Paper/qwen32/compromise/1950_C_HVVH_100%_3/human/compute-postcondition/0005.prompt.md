You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and for each of the t test cases, the input is a string s of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where hh is a two-digit integer representing hours from 00 to 23, and mm is a two-digit integer representing minutes from 00 to 59.
def func():
    day = 'AM'
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
        
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
            if h == 12:
                day = 'PM'
        
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `day` is the last determined day ('AM' or 'PM') based on the last input time, and `n` is the input integer.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case is a string `s` of length 5 in the format "hh:mm". It returns a result for each test case indicating whether the given time is valid (i.e., hours between 00 and 23 and minutes between 00 and 59). If the time is valid, it returns "Valid"; otherwise, it returns "Invalid".

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
