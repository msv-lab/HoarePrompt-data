Postcondition: **`t` is the new input string, `n` must be at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input string, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is `k` and the rest are 0, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `k` is `a[l - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `k` is `a[l] % m`, `q1` is `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 1`, `q2` is `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 1`, and `t[i]` is not 'R'**
