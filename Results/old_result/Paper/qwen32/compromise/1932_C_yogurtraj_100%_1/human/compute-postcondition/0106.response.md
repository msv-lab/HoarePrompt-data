Output State: **`t` is the new input string, `n` must be at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input string, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is `k` and the rest are 0, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `k` is `(a[l] % m) * a[l + 1] % m`, `q1` is `l - 1`, `q2` is `l + 2`, and the current character at index `i` in `t` is 'R'.**

In this output state, only the value of `q2` has been changed. It is now `l + 2` because 1 has been added to its previous value `l + 1`. All other variables retain their initial values as described.
