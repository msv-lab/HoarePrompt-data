The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was initially set to an integer value between 1 and 10,000.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from input, `m` is the second integer read from input.**
