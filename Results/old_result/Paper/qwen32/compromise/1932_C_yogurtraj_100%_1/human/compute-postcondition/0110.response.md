Postcondition: **`t` is the new input string, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input string, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is `k` and the rest are 0, `ii` is `ii + 1`. If `t[i]` is 'R', then `k` is `((a[l] % m) * a[l + 1]) % m`, `q1` is `l - 1`, and `q2` is `l + 2`. Otherwise, `k` is `(k * a[q1]) % m`, `q1` is `l - 3` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 2`, and `q2` is `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 1`.**
