The provided code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on whitespace, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. This means that the value of `a` will be updated to reflect the new list of integers obtained from the input.

Given the initial state, all other variables remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of integers, but the new value of `a` will be determined by the input provided.

Output State: **`t`: The input string, unchanged. `n`: The first integer from the input, unchanged. `m`: The second integer from the input, unchanged. `a`: The list of integers obtained from the new input, `l`: The number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, unchanged. `k`: The final value of `k` after the last iteration of the loop, unchanged. `q1` and `q2`: The final values of `q1` and `q2` after the last iteration of the loop, unchanged. `y`: The list `y` with `n` elements where each element from index `0` to `n-2` is the value of `k` calculated in each iteration, and the last element (index `n-1`) is the initial value of `k`, unchanged. `ii`: The loop variable `ii` incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, unchanged.**
