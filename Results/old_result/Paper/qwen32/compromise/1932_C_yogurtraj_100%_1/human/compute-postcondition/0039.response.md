The code snippet `q1 -= 1` decrements the value of `q1` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a string (the input value), `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `m` is the second integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element being `k`. Specifically, `y[i]` is now `k`. `i` is `n - 4`. If `t[i]` is 'R', then `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m` and `q2` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m` and `q1` is decremented by 1. `q2` is adjusted accordingly in both cases. `k` is now `k * a[q1] % m`. `q1` is decremented by 1.**
