Correctness: **False**

The provided program defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, but it does not include any logic to solve the problem as described. The functions seem to compute the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of numbers, but this is not directly related to the task of distributing the bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

To solve the problem, we need to find a distribution of bets \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) such that:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \quad \text{for all} \quad 1 \le i \le n \]

This can be simplified to:

\[ \sum_{j \neq i} x_j < (k_i - 1) \cdot x_i \]

One possible approach is to assign bets in such a way that the total sum of bets is minimized while still satisfying the condition. A simple strategy is to set each \( x_i \) to be the LCM of all \( k_j - 1 \) for \( j \neq i \), but this is not the most efficient or straightforward method.

Here is a possible solution:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def lcm(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)

def solve_test_case(n, k):
    # Compute the LCM of all (k_i - 1)
    lcm_all_minus_1 = reduce(lcm, (ki - 1 for ki in k))
    
    # Assign bets based on the LCM
    bets = [lcm_all_minus_1 // (ki - 1) for ki in k]
    
    # Check if the solution is valid
    total_bet = sum(bets)
    for i in range(n):
        if total_bet >= k[i] * bets[i]:
            return -1
    
    return bets

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        index += 1
        k = list(map(int, input[index:index+n]))
        index += n
        result = solve_test_case(n, k)
        if result == -1:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# main()
```

This solution calculates the bets based on the LCM of all \( k_i - 1 \) values and checks if the total bet is less than the amount received for each winning outcome. If the solution is valid, it returns the bets; otherwise, it returns -1.
