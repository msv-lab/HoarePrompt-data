You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to distribute a certain number of coins across `n` possible outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received if any one of the outcomes wins. For the i-th outcome, if it wins, the amount received is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the amount bet on the i-th outcome.

### Requirements

1. The total amount of coins bet should be less than the amount received for each possible winning outcome.
2. Each bet `x_i` should be a positive integer (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9).

### Approach

To ensure that the total amount of coins bet is less than the amount received for any winning outcome, we need to find a set of bets `x_i` such that:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \text{ for all } i \]

This simplifies to:

\[ \sum_{j \neq i} x_j < (k_i - 1) \cdot x_i \]

To find such a set of `x_i`, we can use the concept of least common multiple (LCM). One way to ensure the condition is met is to set each `x_i` to be a multiple of the LCM of the multipliers `k_j` for `j ≠ i`. This ensures that the sum of bets on other outcomes is significantly smaller compared to the bet on the i-th outcome scaled by `k_i`.

### Provided Code Analysis

The provided code includes two functions:

1. `func_1(a, b)`: Computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b`.
2. `func_2(numbers)`: Computes the LCM of a list of numbers.

However, the code does not fully implement the solution to the problem. It calculates the LCM of all multipliers, but it does not use this LCM to derive the bets `x_i`.

### Correct Solution Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we can:

1. Compute the LCM of all multipliers.
2. For each outcome `i`, set the bet `x_i` to be the LCM of all other multipliers divided by `k_i - 1`. This ensures that the sum of bets on other outcomes is less than `(k_i - 1) * x_i`.

### Conclusion

The provided code does not fully implement the solution to the problem. It only calculates the LCM of all multipliers but does not derive the bets `x_i` based on the LCM. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it stands.
