Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not solve the problem as described. The problem requires determining a distribution of bets such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. The given code includes two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which compute the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of numbers. This does not address the problem of distributing bets according to the given multipliers.

Let's analyze why the code is incorrect:

1. **Purpose of the Code**: The provided code calculates the LCM of a list of numbers. However, the problem requires a specific distribution of bets that meets the condition of coming out ahead in any winning outcome.

2. **Logic for the Problem**: To solve the problem, we need to find a set of bets \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) such that:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \quad \text{for all} \quad i
   \]
   This can be simplified to finding \(x_i\) such that:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < \min(k_i \cdot x_i)
   \]
   One way to solve this is to set \(x_i = \text{LCM}(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n) / k_i\) and ensure that the sum of \(x_i\) is less than the smallest \(k_i \cdot x_i\).

3. **Example of Correct Solution**:
   For the first test case:
   ```
   n = 3
   k = [3, 2, 7]
   LCM = 42
   x = [14, 21, 6]
   Total bet = 41
   Returns: 42, 42, 42
   ```
   Here, the total bet is 41, and the returns are 42 for each outcome, satisfying the condition.

4. **Why the Given Code is Incorrect**: The provided code calculates the LCM but does not use it to determine the bets. It also does not check if the total bet is less than the returns for each outcome.

Thus, the code provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
