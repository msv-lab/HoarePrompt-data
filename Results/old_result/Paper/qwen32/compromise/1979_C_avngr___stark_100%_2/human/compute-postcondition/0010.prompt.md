You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers, where each integer is a multiplier \( k_i \) for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning.
def func_2(numbers):
    result = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        result = func_1(result, num)
        
    #State: - The loop will execute for each element in `numbers` starting from the second element until the end of the list.
    #- The final `result` will be the cumulative result of applying `func_1` to the initial `result` (which is `numbers[0]`) and each subsequent element in `numbers`.
    #
    #In natural language:
    #- After all iterations, `result` will be the final value obtained by applying `func_1` sequentially to the initial `result` and each element in `numbers` starting from the second element until the last element.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state is:
    #Output State:
    return result
    #The program returns the final value obtained by sequentially applying `func_1` to the initial `result` (which is `numbers[0]`) and each element in `numbers` starting from the second element until the last element.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. It returns the final value obtained by sequentially applying `func_1` to the initial `result` (which is `numbers[0]`) and each subsequent element in `numbers` until the last element.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the final value obtained by sequentially applying `func_1` to the initial `result` (which is `numbers[0]`) and each element in `numbers` starting from the second element until the last element.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
