The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes. This is followed by a line containing n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
