#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^4, a is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= a_i <= 10^4, and s is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: `b` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= b_i <= 10^4, arranged according to the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in the string `s`; `l` is the number of 'L' characters encountered in `s`; `r` is `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters encountered in `s`.

    #State: `b` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in the string `s`, `r` is `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters in the string `s`, `ans` is a list containing the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop in reverse order of `b`, `p` is the final value after all iterations.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the list `ans` in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `m`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'. It processes these inputs to produce a list `ans` where each element is the cumulative product of elements from `a` in a specific order, modulo `m`, as determined by the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`. The function returns the list `ans` in reverse order.
