The code snippet provided assigns the value `1` to the variable `p`. No other variables are affected by this statement. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change while keeping the other variables as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`b` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= b_i <= 10^4, arranged according to the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in the string `s`; `l` is the number of 'L' characters encountered in `s`; `r` is `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters encountered in `s`; `ans` is an empty list; `p` is 1.**
