The code snippet assigns the value `n - 1` to the variable `r`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= a_i <= 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is an empty list, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.**
