Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary in the context of the problem description and the original assessment.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We are given an array `a` of length `n`, a positive integer `m`, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'.
- We need to process each command in `s` in order:
  - Output the remainder of the product of all elements of the current array `a` when divided by `m`.
  - If the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from `a`.
  - If the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from `a`.

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        ans.append(p)
    return reversed(ans)
```

### Function Summary Recap:
- The function `func_1` constructs an array `b` by appending elements from the original array `a` based on the commands 'L' and 'R'.
- It then calculates the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order, modulo `m`, and returns this list in reverse order.

### Issues Identified in the Provided Program:
1. **Incorrect Construction of Array `b`:**
   - The program constructs `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the commands 'L' and 'R', but it does not actually modify `a` to reflect the removal of elements.
   - The array `b` should represent the elements that were removed in the order they were removed, but the program does not simulate the actual removal of elements from `a`.

2. **Incorrect Product Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the product of elements in `b` in reverse order and takes the remainder modulo `m`.
   - This does not reflect the state of `a` after each command, as the product should be calculated based on the current state of `a` after each command.

### Correct Approach:
- We need to maintain the current product of the elements in `a` and update it based on the commands 'L' and 'R'.
- For each command, we output the current product modulo `m` and then update the product by removing the appropriate element from `a`.

### Corrected Program Example:
```python
def process_commands(n, m, a, s):
    result = []
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        # Output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m
        result.append(product % m)
        
        # Update the product for the next iteration
        if s[i] == 'L':
            product = (product * a[i]) % m
        else:
            product = (product * a[n - i - 1]) % m
    
    return result

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*process_commands(n, m, a, s))
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The issues identified in the original assessment are valid, and the program needs to be corrected to properly simulate the removal of elements from `a` and calculate the product remainders based on the current state of `a`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
