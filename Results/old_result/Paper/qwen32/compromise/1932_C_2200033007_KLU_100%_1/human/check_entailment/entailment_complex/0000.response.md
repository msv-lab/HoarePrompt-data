Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Order of Operations**: The program first constructs a list `b` based on the commands 'L' and 'R', and then computes the product of elements in `b` in reverse order. However, the problem requires computing the product of the current state of the array `a` (not `b`) at each step before removing an element based on the command.

2. **Incorrect Product Calculation**: The product should be calculated on the elements of the current array `a` at each step, not on the rearranged list `b`. Specifically, the product should be computed before any element is removed based on the command.

3. **Inefficient Product Calculation**: The program calculates the product in reverse order and then reverses the result at the end. This is unnecessary and incorrect because it does not reflect the state of the array `a` at each step as required by the problem.

4. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation should be applied at each step of the product calculation to prevent overflow and ensure the result fits within the constraints.

To correct the program, the product of the elements of the current array `a` should be computed and the modulo operation should be applied at each step before modifying the array based on the command.

Correctness: **False**

The program as described does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement, leading to incorrect results.
