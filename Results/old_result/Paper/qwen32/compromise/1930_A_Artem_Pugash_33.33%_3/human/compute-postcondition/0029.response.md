Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` remains greater than 0, For each test case, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is the integer value of the first element that was initially popped from `numbers`, `numbers` is a non-empty sorted list of strings (excluding the first two elements), `suma` is `min(a, b)`, `i` is incremented by 1, `b` is the integer value of the second element that was popped from `numbers`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `suma` is updated to be the minimum of `a` and `b`. All other variables retain their previous values or conditions.
