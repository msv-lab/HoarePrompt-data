To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `numCases`.

Given:
- State at the end of the previous iteration: `numbers: []`, `suma: sum of minimums of all pairs`, `i: number of iterations`.
- Loop statement: `for i in range(numCases):`

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **Variable `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` represents the number of completed iterations.
   - For the next iteration to start, `i` should be incremented by 1.

2. **Variable `numCases`:**
   - This variable determines the total number of iterations the loop should perform.
   - Since `numCases` does not change within the loop, it remains the same.

3. **Other Variables (`numbers`, `suma`):**
   - These variables are not part of the loop head, so they should remain unchanged according to the instructions.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `i` should be incremented by 1.
- `numCases` remains unchanged.
- `numbers` and `suma` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the new state is:
State: **`numbers: []`, `suma: sum of minimums of all pairs`, `i: number of iterations + 1`, `numCases: numCases`**

Since `i` is the number of iterations completed, incrementing it means moving to the next iteration. Thus, if `i` was 0 after the first iteration, it would be 1 at the start of the second iteration, and so on.

Final Answer:
State: **`numbers: []`, `suma: sum of minimums of all pairs`, `i: number of iterations + 1`**
