To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `numbers != []`. This means that the loop will execute as long as the list `numbers` is not empty.

Given the current state:
- `numbers` is a sorted list of strings in ascending order.
- `suma` is 0.
- `i` is number of iterations + 1.
- `numInteger` is input integer.

The only variable in the loop head is `numbers`. For the loop to execute, `numbers` must not be an empty list.

### Analysis:
- The current state specifies that `numbers` is a sorted list of strings in ascending order. This implies that `numbers` could be an empty list or a non-empty list.
- To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to make sure that `numbers` is not an empty list.

### Adjustment:
- We need to specify that `numbers` must contain at least one string to ensure the loop condition `numbers != []` is true.

### Final State:
State: **`numbers` is a non-empty sorted list of strings in ascending order; `suma` is 0; `i` is number of iterations + 1; `numInteger` is input integer**.
