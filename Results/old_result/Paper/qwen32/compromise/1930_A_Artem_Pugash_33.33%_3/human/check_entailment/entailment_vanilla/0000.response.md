### Reasoning:
To solve this problem optimally, we need to maximize the sum of the minimum values obtained from pairs of numbers. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Sorting**: The key insight is to sort the numbers in ascending order. This ensures that when we pair the smallest numbers together, we are maximizing the contribution of the smaller number in each pair to the total score.

2. **Pairing Strategy**: After sorting, we can simply take the numbers two at a time from the beginning of the sorted list. Since the list is sorted in ascending order, the first number in each pair will always be the smaller one, thus maximizing the sum of the minimums.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the number of integers `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   - Sort the list of integers in non-decreasing order.
   - Initialize a variable `suma` to keep track of the total score.
   - Iterate through the sorted list, taking two numbers at a time, adding the smaller one (which is the first in the sorted list) to `suma`.
   - Print the final score for each test case.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the number of integers and the list of integers.
- It sorts the list of integers in non-decreasing order (`numbers.sort(reverse=False)`).
- It initializes `suma` to 0.
- It uses a while loop to repeatedly pop the first two elements from the sorted list, adds the smaller one (which is the first popped element due to the sort) to `suma`, and continues until the list is empty.
- Finally, it prints the computed `suma` for each test case.

Given these steps, the program correctly implements the optimal strategy for solving the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
