### Reasoning:

The goal of the problem is to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers from the list and adding the minimum value of each pair to the score. The optimal strategy to achieve this is to always pick the smallest available numbers first, as this will maximize the contribution of the smaller numbers to the score.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The list of integers is sorted in ascending order. This ensures that when we pick pairs, we are always picking the smallest available numbers first.

3. **Pairing and Summing:**
   - The program iteratively pops the first two elements from the sorted list (which are the smallest two elements at each step), computes their minimum, adds this minimum to the score, and repeats until all elements have been paired and removed from the list.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing each test case, the program prints the computed score for that test case.

This approach is correct because sorting the list and always picking the smallest two elements ensures that we are maximizing the contribution of the smaller numbers to the score, which aligns with the problem's objective.

### Verification Against Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `1`, `[2, 3]`
  - Sorted: `[2, 3]`
  - Pair: `(2, 3)`, Score: `2`
  - Output: `2`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `2`, `[1, 1, 2, 1]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 1, 1, 2]`
  - Pairs: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, Scores: `1 + 1 = 2`
  - Output: `2`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `3`, `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Pairs: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 1)`, `(1, 1)`, Scores: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
  - Output: `3`

All test cases match the expected outputs, confirming that the program correctly implements the optimal strategy.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the solution to the problem by sorting the list of integers and summing the minimums of the pairs formed. Therefore, the correctness of the program is verified.

**Correctness: True**
