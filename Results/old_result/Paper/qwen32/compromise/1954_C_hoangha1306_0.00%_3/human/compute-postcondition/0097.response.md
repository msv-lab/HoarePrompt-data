The code snippet `kq2 = kq2 + str(x)` appends the string representation of `x` to the current value of `kq2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `a` is a string with at least one character.
- `b` is the new input string.
- `q` is incremented by 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[1]` and `b[1]`.
- `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[1]` and `b[1]`.
- `vt` is 1.
- `kq1` is `kq1` concatenated with `str(y)`.

The only variable that changes is `kq2` which gets concatenated with `str(x)`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[1]` and `b[1]`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[1]` and `b[1]`, `vt` is 1, `kq1` is `kq1` concatenated with `str(y)`, `kq2` is `kq2` concatenated with `str(x)`**.
