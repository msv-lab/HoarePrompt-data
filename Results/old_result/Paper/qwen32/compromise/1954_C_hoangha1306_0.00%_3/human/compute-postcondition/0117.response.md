Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is 2. If `a[2]` is equal to `b[2]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are each concatenated with `a[2]`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[2]` and `b[2]`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[2]` and `b[2]`, and if `vt` was originally 0, it is set to 1. In both cases, `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `x`.**
