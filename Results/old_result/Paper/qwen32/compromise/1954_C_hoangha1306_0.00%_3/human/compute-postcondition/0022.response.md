Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is an input string, `vt` is 1, and the characters at index `i` in `a` and `b` are not equal. `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `x` and `kq2` is a string containing the value of `y`. Otherwise, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`.**

This summarizes the conditions and the resulting values of `kq1` and `kq2` based on the comparison of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
