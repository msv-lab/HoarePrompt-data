Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a new input string, `q` is `q + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `kq1` is `kq1` concatenated with `a[i]`, `kq2` is `kq2` concatenated with `a[i]`, `vt` is unchanged, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged.**

In natural language: The value of `kq2` has been updated to include the character `a[i]` concatenated to its previous value. All other variables retain their initial values or states as described.
