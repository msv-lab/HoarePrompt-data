To determine what will be printed by the `print(kq2)` statement, we need to understand how `kq2` is constructed based on the given initial state and the conditions described.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t`: An integer (initial input).
- `a`: A string (initial input).
- `b`: A string (initial input).
- `kq1`: A string constructed by appending characters from `a` and `b` based on certain conditions.
- `kq2`: A string constructed by appending characters from `a` and `b` based on certain conditions.
- `vt`: 0 if all characters of `a` and `b` were equal, otherwise 1.
- `q`: Incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop (though `q` is not used further).

### Construction of `kq2`:
The exact construction of `kq2` is not explicitly detailed in the precondition, but we can infer that it is built similarly to `kq1` by appending characters from `a` and `b` under certain conditions. Since `kq2` is specifically mentioned in the `print` statement, we need to focus on how it is formed.

Without specific conditions on how `kq2` is constructed, we can assume it might be a concatenation or a specific pattern derived from `a` and `b`. However, the problem does not provide the exact logic for constructing `kq2`, so we can only describe it in terms of its construction process.

### Output:
Since we don't have the exact logic for constructing `kq2`, we can describe it as a string constructed from `a` and `b` based on the conditions provided for `kq1`.

Output: **kq2 (where kq2 is a string constructed by appending characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions described for `kq1`)**
