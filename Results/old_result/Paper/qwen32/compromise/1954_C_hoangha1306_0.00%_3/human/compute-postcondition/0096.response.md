The code snippet `kq1 = kq1 + str(y)` appends the string representation of `y` to the variable `kq1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[1]` and `b[1]`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[1]` and `b[1]`, `vt` is 1, `kq1` is `kq1` concatenated with `str(y)`**.
