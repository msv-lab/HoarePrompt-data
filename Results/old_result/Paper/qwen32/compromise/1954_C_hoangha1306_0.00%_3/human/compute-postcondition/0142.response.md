Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a new input string, `vt` is 1, `q` is `q + 1`, and `x` is the smaller integer value between `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`. If `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, then `kq1` is the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`.**
