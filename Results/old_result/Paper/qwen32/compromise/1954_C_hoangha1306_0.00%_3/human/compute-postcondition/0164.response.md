The provided code snippet only modifies `kq1` by concatenating `a[i]` to it. No other variables are directly altered by this specific line of code. Therefore, the state of `t`, `a`, `b`, `q`, `i`, `kq2`, `vt`, `x`, and `y` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a new input string, `q` is `q + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `kq1` is `kq1` concatenated with `a[i]`, `kq2` is unchanged, `vt` is unchanged, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged.**
