The variable `kq1` is reassigned an empty string. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `kq2`, `vt`, and `q`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` is the new input string; `b` is the new input string; `kq1` is an empty string; `kq2` is a string formed by the rules described; `vt` is 0 if no mismatches occurred, otherwise 1; `q` is incremented by 1.**
