The code snippet `kq1 = kq1 + a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the variable `kq1`. Given that `i` is `i + 1` before this line, it means `i` has already been incremented by 1. Therefore, `a[i]` refers to the character at the new index `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is an input string, `i` is `i + 1`, `kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with the character `a[i]`.**
