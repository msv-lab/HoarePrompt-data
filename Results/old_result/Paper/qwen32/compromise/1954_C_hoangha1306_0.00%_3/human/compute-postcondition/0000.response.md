Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, x and y are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9. Additionally, x and y have the same number of digits in each test case.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to the integer value provided by the input. The conditions and constraints for `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are described as part of the test cases that follow the input of `t`.
