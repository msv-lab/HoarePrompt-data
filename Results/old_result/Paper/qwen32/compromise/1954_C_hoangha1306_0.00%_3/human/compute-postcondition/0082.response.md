Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `vt` is 1, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0, `x` is `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, and `y` is `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`. If `a[i] > b[i]`, then `kq1` is a string containing the character `str(x)` and `kq2` is a string containing the character `str(y)`. Otherwise, `kq1` is a string containing the character `str(y)` and `kq2` is a string containing the character `str(x)`**.
