Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0. If the characters at index `i` of `a` and `b` are equal, `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the first character of `a`. If the characters at index `i` of `a` and `b` are not equal, `x` is `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))` and `y` is `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`. If `vt` was 0, `vt` is now 1, and `kq1` is `str(y)` and `kq2` is `str(x)` if `a[i] > b[i]`, otherwise `kq1` is `str(x)` and `kq2` is `str(y)`. If `vt` was not 0, `kq1` is `str(y)` and `kq2` is `str(x)` regardless of the comparison between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**
