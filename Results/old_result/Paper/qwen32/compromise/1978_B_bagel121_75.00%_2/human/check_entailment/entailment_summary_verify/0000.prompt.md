You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) â€” the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) â€” the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer â€” the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
            p2 = (n - k) * a
            print(ans + p2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on these integers. The result is printed on a new line for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Bob can sell buns at a usual price `a` or at a modified price where the price of the `i-th` bun is `(b - i + 1)` for the first `k` buns. The goal is to maximize profit by choosing the optimal `k`.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates the maximum profit based on the following logic:
- If `a >= b`, it sells all buns at the usual price `a`.
- Otherwise, it calculates `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)`, which is the maximum number of buns that can be sold at the modified price without the price going below 1.
- It calculates the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
- It calculates the profit from selling the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a`.
- It prints the total profit.

### Correctness Check:
Let's check if the program handles all cases correctly.

1. **Case 1: `a >= b`**
   - The program correctly sells all buns at the usual price `a`.
   - This is handled correctly by the condition `if a >= b`.

2. **Case 2: `a < b`**
   - The program calculates `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)`.
   - This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and does not cause the price to go below 1.
   - The profit from the first `k` buns is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
   - The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns is `(n - k) * a`.
   - This logic seems correct for maximizing profit.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Small Values:** When `n`, `a`, and `b` are small, the program should still work correctly.
   - **Large Values:** When `n`, `a`, and `b` are large (up to \(10^9\)), the program should handle these efficiently without integer overflow or performance issues. The use of integer division and arithmetic series formula ensures that the program remains efficient.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to handle all cases correctly based on the provided logic and problem description. It efficiently calculates the maximum profit for each test case.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly handles all cases by choosing the optimal `k` and calculating the profit based on the given conditions. It efficiently computes the profit even for large values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
