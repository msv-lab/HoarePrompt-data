You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. The number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)
        
    #State: The output state consists of t lines, each corresponding to the result of a test case. For each test case, if the sum of the scores (p_1 + p_2 + p_3) is odd, the output is '-1'. Otherwise, the output is the calculated result given by the formula (p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - max(0, p_3 - p_0 - p_1)) // 2. The variables p_1, p_2, p_3, and t remain unchanged after the loop executes all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three sorted scores. For each test case, it checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the function outputs '-1'. Otherwise, it calculates and outputs a specific result based on the formula provided. The input scores and the number of test cases remain unchanged after processing.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the provided Python program is correct, we need to carefully analyze both the problem description and the logic implemented in the code. The key points to consider are:

1. **Total Points and Draws**: The total points across all players must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (in case of a win/loss) or 2 points (in case of a draw).
2. **Score Distribution**: The scores are given in non-decreasing order, i.e., \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).
3. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The goal is to maximize the number of draws. The formula used in the code attempts to calculate this.

Let's break down the code logic:

- **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads three scores.
- **Total Points Check**: It checks if the total points are even. If not, it prints `-1` because an odd total points indicate an impossible score distribution.
- **Draws Calculation**: If the total points are even, it calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.

Now, let's verify if the formula is correct:

- **Understanding the Formula**: The formula tries to maximize draws by minimizing the points attributed to wins. The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the highest score \( p_3 \) is not attributed more points than necessary to the wins, allowing the remaining points to be attributed to draws.
- **Correctness of the Formula**: The formula is designed to ensure that the points can be distributed in a way that respects the constraints of the problem (i.e., the total points being even and the scores being consistent with a valid set of games).

Let's test the program with the provided examples to ensure it works correctly:

1. **Example 1**: `0 0 0` -> Total points = 0, even. Draws = `(0 + 0 + 0 - max(0, 0 - 0 - 0)) // 2` = 0.
2. **Example 2**: `0 1 1` -> Total points = 2, even. Draws = `(0 + 1 + 1 - max(0, 1 - 0 - 1)) // 2` = 1.
3. **Example 3**: `1 1 1` -> Total points = 3, odd. Output = `-1`.
4. **Example 4**: `1 1 2` -> Total points = 4, even. Draws = `(1 + 1 + 2 - max(0, 2 - 1 - 1)) // 2` = 2.
5. **Example 5**: `3 3 3` -> Total points = 9, odd. Output = `-1`.
6. **Example 6**: `3 4 5` -> Total points = 12, even. Draws = `(3 + 4 + 5 - max(0, 5 - 3 - 4)) // 2` = 6.
7. **Example 7**: `1 1 10` -> Total points = 12, even. Draws = `(1 + 1 + 10 - max(0, 10 - 1 - 1)) // 2` = 2.

The program produces the correct output for all the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

Reasoning: The program correctly checks for the feasibility of the scores (total points must be even) and calculates the maximum number of draws using a valid formula that respects the constraints of the problem.
