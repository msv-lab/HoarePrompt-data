### Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify that it correctly computes the maximum possible number of draws based on the scores of the three players, or correctly identifies when the scores cannot be achieved through a valid set of games.

The program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the scores of the three players, ensuring they are in non-decreasing order.
3. It checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the total points from games must be even (since each game awards an even number of points: either 2 for a win/loss or 2 for a draw).
4. If the sum of the scores is even, it calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - \max(0, p_3 - p_0 - p_1)}{2}
   \]
   This formula is derived from the fact that the total points can be decomposed into points from wins (which contribute 2 points per game) and points from draws (which also contribute 2 points per game). The term `max(0, p_3 - p_0 - p_1)` accounts for the minimum points that must come from wins to ensure that player 3's score is achievable given the scores of the other two players.

Let's verify the formula:
- The term `p_1 + p_2 + p_3` represents the total points.
- The term `max(0, p_3 - p_0 - p_1)` represents the minimum points that must be awarded as wins to ensure that player 3's score is possible. This is because if player 3's score is greater than the sum of the scores of the other two players, some of the points must come from wins against these players.
- Subtracting this term from the total points leaves the maximum points that can come from draws.
- Dividing by 2 gives the number of draws because each draw contributes 2 points.

### Verification with Example Cases:
1. **Test Case: 0 0 0**
   - Total points: 0 (even)
   - Draws: \((0 + 0 + 0 - \max(0, 0 - 0 - 0)) / 2 = 0\)
   - Output: 0 (Correct)

2. **Test Case: 0 1 1**
   - Total points: 2 (even)
   - Draws: \((0 + 1 + 1 - \max(0, 1 - 0 - 1)) / 2 = 1\)
   - Output: 1 (Correct)

3. **Test Case: 1 1 1**
   - Total points: 3 (odd)
   - Output: -1 (Correct)

4. **Test Case: 1 1 2**
   - Total points: 4 (even)
   - Draws: \((1 + 1 + 2 - \max(0, 2 - 1 - 1)) / 2 = 2\)
   - Output: 2 (Correct)

5. **Test Case: 3 3 3**
   - Total points: 9 (odd)
   - Output: -1 (Correct)

6. **Test Case: 3 4 5**
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - Draws: \((3 + 4 + 5 - \max(0, 5 - 3 - 4)) / 2 = 6\)
   - Output: 6 (Correct)

7. **Test Case: 1 1 10**
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - Draws: \((1 + 1 + 10 - \max(0, 10 - 1 - 1)) / 2 = 2\)
   - Output: 2 (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and adheres to the logic derived from the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
