To determine if the provided Python program is correct, we need to carefully analyze both the problem description and the logic implemented in the code. The key points to consider are:

1. **Total Points and Draws**: The total points across all players must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (in case of a win/loss) or 2 points (in case of a draw).
2. **Score Distribution**: The scores are given in non-decreasing order, i.e., \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).
3. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The goal is to maximize the number of draws. The formula used in the code attempts to calculate this.

Let's break down the code logic:

- **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads three scores.
- **Total Points Check**: It checks if the total points are even. If not, it prints `-1` because an odd total points indicate an impossible score distribution.
- **Draws Calculation**: If the total points are even, it calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.

Now, let's verify if the formula is correct:

- **Understanding the Formula**: The formula tries to maximize draws by minimizing the points attributed to wins. The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that the highest score \( p_3 \) is not attributed more points than necessary to the wins, allowing the remaining points to be attributed to draws.
- **Correctness of the Formula**: The formula is designed to ensure that the points can be distributed in a way that respects the constraints of the problem (i.e., the total points being even and the scores being consistent with a valid set of games).

Let's test the program with the provided examples to ensure it works correctly:

1. **Example 1**: `0 0 0` -> Total points = 0, even. Draws = `(0 + 0 + 0 - max(0, 0 - 0 - 0)) // 2` = 0.
2. **Example 2**: `0 1 1` -> Total points = 2, even. Draws = `(0 + 1 + 1 - max(0, 1 - 0 - 1)) // 2` = 1.
3. **Example 3**: `1 1 1` -> Total points = 3, odd. Output = `-1`.
4. **Example 4**: `1 1 2` -> Total points = 4, even. Draws = `(1 + 1 + 2 - max(0, 2 - 1 - 1)) // 2` = 2.
5. **Example 5**: `3 3 3` -> Total points = 9, odd. Output = `-1`.
6. **Example 6**: `3 4 5` -> Total points = 12, even. Draws = `(3 + 4 + 5 - max(0, 5 - 3 - 4)) // 2` = 6.
7. **Example 7**: `1 1 10` -> Total points = 12, even. Draws = `(1 + 1 + 10 - max(0, 10 - 1 - 1)) // 2` = 2.

The program produces the correct output for all the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

Reasoning: The program correctly checks for the feasibility of the scores (total points must be even) and calculates the maximum number of draws using a valid formula that respects the constraints of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
