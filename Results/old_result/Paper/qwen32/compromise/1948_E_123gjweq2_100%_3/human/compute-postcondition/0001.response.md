The code assigns the value of `right + 1` to the variable `big_element`. The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, and `small_element` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number for the vertices in the range from left to right, `small_element` is `left + 1`, and `big_element` is `right + 1`.**
