In the provided for loop:

```python
for i in range(not_mid):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `not_mid` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. The variable `not_mid` is calculated as `right - left + 1 - mid`, and it depends on the values of `right`, `left`, and `mid`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n`.
- `clique` is an integer representing the clique number for the vertices in the range from `left` to `right`.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`.
- `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`.
- `arr[left + mid - 1]` to `arr[left]` are set to `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` respectively.
- `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all set to `clique`.

To ensure the loop executes, `not_mid` must be greater than 0. Since `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`, and `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, it follows that `not_mid` is always a non-negative integer. However, to ensure it is greater than 0, we need `right - left + 1 - mid > 0`, which simplifies to `right - left + 1 > mid`.

Given that `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, the smallest possible value for `mid` is 1 when `right - left + 1` is 2 (i.e., `right = left + 1`). Therefore, `not_mid` will be 1 in this case, which is greater than 0.

Thus, the state does not need to be adjusted further for the loop to execute, as long as the initial conditions `0 <= left < right < n` hold.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number for the vertices in the range from left to right, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`, `arr[left + mid - 1]` to `arr[left]` are set to `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` respectively, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all set to `clique`**.
