### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summaries to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to n to vertices of a graph.
- We need to add edges based on the condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \leq k\).
- The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques and output the assignment, the number of cliques, and the partition.

#### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Global Variables**:
   - The functions `func_1` and `make_array` use global variables `arr` and `cliquess`. This is a significant issue because it means that the values of `arr` and `cliquess` are not scoped to individual test cases. This will lead to incorrect results when multiple test cases are processed.
   
2. **Initialization of Arrays**:
   - The arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized with zeros. However, the problem requires `arr` to contain distinct integers from 1 to n. The program does not ensure this.
   
3. **Logic for Array Construction**:
   - The function `make_array` is supposed to fill `arr` and `cliquess` such that `arr` contains distinct integers from 1 to n and the conditions for edge creation are met. However, the current logic does not ensure this. For example, it sets the first half of the range in `arr` to increasing values starting from `left + 1` and the second half to decreasing values starting from `right + 1`. This does not guarantee that `arr` contains distinct integers from 1 to n.
   
4. **Edge Condition Handling**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the edge conditions for the graph construction, specifically the condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \leq k\). The logic in `make_array` does not ensure that this condition is met for all pairs of vertices.
   
5. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the results directly within the function, which is not ideal for handling multiple test cases. The results should be collected and printed after processing all test cases.

#### Example of a Case Where the Program Fails:

Let's consider the test case `n = 5` and `k = 4`.

- The program initializes `arr` and `cliquess` with zeros.
- The function `make_array` attempts to fill these arrays but does not ensure that `arr` contains distinct integers from 1 to 5.
- The logic for partitioning the graph into cliques based on the condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \leq k\) is not correctly implemented.

For `n = 5` and `k = 4`, a correct solution could be:
- `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- `cliques = 1`
- `cliquess = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`

This is because with `arr` being a simple sequence from 1 to 5, the condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \leq k\) is satisfied for all pairs of vertices, and thus, all vertices can be in the same clique.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem requirements and fails to produce the correct output for at least one test case. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
