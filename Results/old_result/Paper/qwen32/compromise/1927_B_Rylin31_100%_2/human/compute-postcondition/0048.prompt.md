Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. It is guaranteed that for each test case, there exists a suitable string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    l = int(input())
    s = [(0) for i in range(l)]
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = ''
    for j in array:
        ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
        s[j] += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l` is an input integer; `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j` appears in `array`; `array` is a list of integers read from the input; `ans` is a string formed by concatenating characters corresponding to the values in `s` after all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l` is the input integer; `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element at index `j` is incremented by the number of times `j` appears in `array`; `array` is a list of integers read from the input; `ans` is a string formed by appending characters `chr(s[j] + 97)` for each `j` in `array`; `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l` is the newly input integer, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element `s[j]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `j` in `array`, `array` is the newly input list of integers, `ans` is a string formed by concatenating the characters corresponding to the ASCII values `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
