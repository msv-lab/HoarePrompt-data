Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it constructs and prints a string of lowercase Latin letters based on a given list of integers. The string is generated such that each integer in the list specifies the position in the string where the next letter in the alphabet sequence should be placed and incremented for subsequent occurrences.**
