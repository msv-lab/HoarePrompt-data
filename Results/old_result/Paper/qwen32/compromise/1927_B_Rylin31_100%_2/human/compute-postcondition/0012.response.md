Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state step by step:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `l` is an input integer
- `s` is a list of `l` zeros except `s[j]` which is 2
- `array` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one more element
- `ans` is the string 'ab'
- `j` is the next element in `array`

The code snippet is:
```
ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
```

Since `s[j]` is 2 (as per the initial state description), the expression `s[j] + 97` evaluates to `2 + 97 = 99`. The `chr` function converts the ASCII value 99 to the character 'c'. Therefore, `ans` is updated from 'ab' to 'abc'.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l` is an input integer; `s` is a list of `l` zeros except `s[j]` which is 2; `array` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one more element; `ans` is the string 'abc'; `j` is the next element in `array`**.
