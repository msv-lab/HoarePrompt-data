The provided code snippet `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` modifies the `ans` variable by appending a character to it. Given that `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element is `0`, the expression `s[j] + 97` will always evaluate to `97`. The `chr` function converts an ASCII value to its corresponding character, so `chr(97)` results in the character `'a'`.

Therefore, the `ans` string will have the character `'a'` appended to it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l` is the input integer; `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element is `0`; `array` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element; `ans` is a string containing the character `'a'`**.
