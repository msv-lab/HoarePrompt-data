The code snippet `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` appends a character to the string `ans`. The character is determined by converting the integer `s[j] + 97` to its corresponding ASCII character.

Given that `ans` initially contains the character `'a'`, after executing the code, `ans` will be updated to include an additional character at the end.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l` is the input integer; `s` is a list of `l` integers; `array` is a list of integers read from the input and must have more than one element; `ans` is a string containing the character `'a'` followed by the character `chr(s[j] + 97)`**.
