Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains several logical errors and does not handle all possible cases correctly. Here are some issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Moves**:
   - The program incorrectly handles the moves of Alice and Bob. For example, the logic for checking if Alice can win by moving diagonally is flawed. The program does not correctly account for the fact that Bob can also move diagonally and could potentially block Alice's path.

2. **Incorrect Draw Conditions**:
   - The program incorrectly checks for draw conditions. For example, it does not correctly handle the scenario where Alice and Bob can move towards each other but cannot catch each other due to the constraints of the board.

3. **Incorrect Win Conditions**:
   - The program incorrectly checks for win conditions. For example, it does not correctly handle the scenario where Alice can move to Bob's position in the next turn, and vice versa.

4. **Incorrect Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when Alice or Bob is in the first or last row, respectively.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the incorrect behavior of the program:

**Counterexample**:
```
1
2 2 1 1 2 2
```
**Expected Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Actual Output**:
```
Alice
```

In this case, Alice starts at (1, 1) and Bob starts at (2, 2). Alice can only move down, down-right, or down-left, but none of these moves will allow her to reach Bob's position. Bob can only move up, up-right, or up-left, but none of these moves will allow him to reach Alice's position. Therefore, the game should end in a draw. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Alice".

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all potential cases, and thus the correctness is **False**.
