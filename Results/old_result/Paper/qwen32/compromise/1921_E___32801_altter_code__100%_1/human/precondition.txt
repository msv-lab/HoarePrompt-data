h and w are positive integers representing the number of rows and columns of the board respectively, where 1 ≤ h ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^9. x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b are integers representing the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips respectively, where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h and 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w. It is guaranteed that (x_a, y_a) ≠ (x_b, y_b). There are t test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
