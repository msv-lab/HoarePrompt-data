The given code snippet modifies the value of `x2` by subtracting `a` from it. Given the initial state and the constraints, we can determine the new value of `x2` after this operation.

Initial State:
- `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`
- `h` is a positive integer such that 1 <= h <= 10^6
- `w` is a positive integer such that 1 <= w <= 10^9
- `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `x_a`, `x_b` <= `h` and 1 <= `y_a`, `y_b` <= `w`; additionally, `x_a` != `x_b` or `y_a` != `y_b`
- `r` is a list of integers read from the input
- `n` is `r[0]`
- `m` is `r[1]`
- `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`
- `y1` is either `r[3] + 1` if `y2` > `y1` or `r[3] - 1` if `y2` <= `y1`
- `x2` is `r[4]`
- `y2` is `r[5]`
- `x2` is greater than `x1`
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd if `y2` > `y1` or even if `y2` <= `y1`
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`
- `a` is `y2 - 1` if `y1` >= `y2` otherwise `m - y2`
- `b` is `x2 - x1`

The code snippet:
```
x2 -= a
```

After executing the code snippet, `x2` is updated to `x2 - a`.

Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `h` is a positive integer such that 1 <= h <= 10^6, `w` is a positive integer such that 1 <= w <= 10^9, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `x_a`, `x_b` <= `h` and 1 <= `y_a`, `y_b` <= `w`; additionally, `x_a` != `x_b` or `y_a` != `y_b`, `r` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`, `y1` is either `r[3] + 1` if `y2` > `y1` or `r[3] - 1` if `y2` <= `y1`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd if `y2` > `y1` or even if `y2` <= `y1`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `a` is `y2 - 1` if `y1` >= `y2` otherwise `m - y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`**.
