Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each of the t test cases, `h` and `w` are positive integers such that 1 <= h <= 10^6 and 1 <= w <= 10^9; `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `x_a`, `x_b` <= `h` and 1 <= `y_a`, `y_b` <= `w`; additionally, `x_a` != `x_b` or `y_a` != `y_b`, ensuring the chips do not start in the same cell; `r` is a list of integers read from the input; `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2]`, `y1` is `r[3]`, `x2` is `r[4]`, `y2` is `r[5]`; `x2` is greater than `x1`; the difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd; `y1` is not equal to `y2`.**
