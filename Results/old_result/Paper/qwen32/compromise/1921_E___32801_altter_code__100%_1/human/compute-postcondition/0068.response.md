Postcondition: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `h` and `w` are positive integers such that 1 <= `h` <= 10^6 and 1 <= `w` <= 10^9; `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `x_a`, `x_b` <= `h` and 1 <= `y_a`, `y_b` <= `w`; `x_a` != `x_b` or `y_a` != `y_b`; `r` is a list of integers read from the input; `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + a`, `y1` is `r[3]`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[5]`; `x2` is greater than `x1` and `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`; `y1` is not equal to `y2`; `y1` is less than or equal to `y2`; `a` is `y1 - 1`; `b` is `x2 - x1`; `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`**
