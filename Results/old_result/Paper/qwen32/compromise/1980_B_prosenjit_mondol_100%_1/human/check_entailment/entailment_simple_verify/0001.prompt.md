You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n, f, and k are integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 100.

    #State: The output state consists of t lines, each corresponding to the result of the comparison for each test case. Each line will contain either 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variables n, f, k, a, x are not preserved across iterations and revert to their initial state at the beginning of each test case. The variable t remains unchanged as it represents the number of test cases.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided code to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Understanding:
1. **Input:**
   - Number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case:
     - \( n \): Number of cubes.
     - \( f \): Index of the favorite cube (1-indexed).
     - \( k \): Number of cubes to be removed (first \( k \) cubes after sorting).
     - List of integers representing the values on the cubes.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, determine whether the favorite cube will be removed in all cases, not removed in any case, or it may be either removed or left.

3. **Logic:**
   - Sort the cubes in non-increasing order.
   - Determine the position of the favorite cube in the sorted list.
   - Compare the position of the favorite cube with the \( k \)-th position in the sorted list to determine the output.

### Program Explanation:
The given program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads \( n \), \( f \), and \( k \) and adjusts \( f \) and \( k \) to be 0-indexed.
   - It reads the list of cube values.
   - It stores the value of the favorite cube.
   - It sorts the list in non-increasing order.
   - It compares the value of the favorite cube with the value at the \( k \)-th position in the sorted list to determine the output:
     - If the value at the \( k \)-th position is greater than the favorite cube's value, the favorite cube will not be removed ("NO").
     - If the value at the \( k \)-th position is less than the favorite cube's value, the favorite cube will be removed ("YES").
     - If the value at the \( k \)-th position is equal to the favorite cube's value, it checks if \( k \) is the last position or if the next position has a smaller value. If so, it prints "YES", otherwise "MAYBE".

### Correctness Check:
The program correctly implements the logic described above. It handles all possible scenarios:
- If the favorite cube's value is less than the \( k \)-th value in the sorted list, it correctly outputs "NO".
- If the favorite cube's value is greater than the \( k \)-th value in the sorted list, it correctly outputs "YES".
- If the favorite cube's value is equal to the \( k \)-th value in the sorted list, it correctly determines if the cube will be removed based on the subsequent values in the list.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct based on the problem description and handles all edge cases appropriately.
