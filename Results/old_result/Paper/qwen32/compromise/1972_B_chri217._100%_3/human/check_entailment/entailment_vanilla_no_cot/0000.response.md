Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins. The key insight is that the game's outcome depends on whether the number of facing-up coins is odd or even. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by playing optimally. Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position by playing optimally. The program implements this logic correctly in `func_2` by checking the parity of the count of 'U' in the string `s` for each test case.
