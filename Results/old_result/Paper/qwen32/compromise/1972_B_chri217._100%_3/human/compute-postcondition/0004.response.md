Output State: **The program returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the `n` and `s` values from each iteration of the loop.**

This means the output is a list of tuples, with each tuple consisting of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a string `s` containing only the characters "U" and "D".
