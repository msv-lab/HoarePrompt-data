#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of lists, where each inner list contains n integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) such that each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99. The outer list contains t inner lists (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), each representing a separate test case.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of lists. Each inner list contains integers between 0 and 99, inclusive, and the outer list contains between 1 and 1000 inner lists. The function returns `True` regardless of the input values.
