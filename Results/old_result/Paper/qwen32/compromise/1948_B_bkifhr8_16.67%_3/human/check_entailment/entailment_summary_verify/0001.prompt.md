You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of lists. Each inner list contains integers between 0 and 99, inclusive, and the outer list contains between 1 and 1000 inner lists. The function returns `True` regardless of the input values.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and then the array elements.

2. **Operation Implementation**:
   - The program iterates over the array to check if the current element is greater than the next element and if it is greater than or equal to 10.
   - If such a condition is met, it attempts to split the current element into its digits and insert them back into the array at the same position.
   - However, the logic for splitting and inserting digits is incorrect. The operation `a // 10` and `a % 10` will only split a two-digit number into its tens and units place, which is correct, but the loop only checks adjacent elements and does not handle cases where multiple splits are needed or where splits affect the order of elements further down the list.

3. **Checking Sorted Order**:
   - After attempting to perform the operations, the program checks if the array is sorted using the `func_1` function.
   - The `func_1` function correctly checks if the list is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints "Yes" or "No" based on whether the array is sorted after attempting to perform the operations.

### Issues in the Program:
- The main issue is that the program only checks adjacent elements and attempts to split numbers that are greater than the next element and greater than or equal to 10. This logic is insufficient because:
  - It does not handle cases where multiple splits are needed.
  - It does not handle cases where a split affects the order of elements further down the list.
  - It does not guarantee that the array will be sorted after a single pass.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program is not guaranteed to correctly determine if the array can be sorted using the described operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
