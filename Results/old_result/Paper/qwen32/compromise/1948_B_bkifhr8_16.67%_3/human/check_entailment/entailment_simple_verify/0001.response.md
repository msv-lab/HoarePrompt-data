### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated code.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if an array can be sorted in non-descending order by repeatedly splitting any element that is at least 10 into its constituent digits.
- The operations can be performed any number of times.

#### Program Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements.

2. **Operation Implementation**:
   - The program iterates through the array and checks if the current element is greater than the next element and if it is greater than or equal to 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the current element into its digits and inserts them back into the array at the same position.
   - The split operation is done using integer division `a // 10` and modulus `a % 10`.

3. **Checking Sorted Order**:
   - After attempting to perform the operations, the program checks if the array is sorted using the `func_1` function.
   - The `func_1` function correctly checks if the list is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotations indicate that the program processes each test case independently.
- Before the function call to `func_1`, the state of `lst` is a list of integers for a single test case.
- The `func_1` function correctly checks if the list is sorted.

#### Issues Identified:
- **Single Pass Limitation**: The program only makes one pass through the array to perform the split operation. This is insufficient because:
  - A single split might not resolve the order for all elements.
  - Further splits might be required after the initial pass.
- **Adjacent Element Check**: The program only checks adjacent elements. This means it might miss opportunities to split elements that could help sort the array when considered in combination with other elements.
- **No Iterative Approach**: The program does not iteratively apply the split operation until no more splits are needed or the array is sorted. This is crucial for ensuring that the array can be fully sorted.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- Given the limitations and issues identified, the program is not guaranteed to correctly determine if the array can be sorted using the described operations.
- The program might incorrectly identify arrays that can be sorted as unsortable due to its single-pass and adjacent-element-check approach.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle all cases where multiple splits are needed or where splits affect the order of elements further down the list. An iterative approach that repeatedly applies the split operation until no more splits are needed or the array is sorted is required to ensure correctness.
