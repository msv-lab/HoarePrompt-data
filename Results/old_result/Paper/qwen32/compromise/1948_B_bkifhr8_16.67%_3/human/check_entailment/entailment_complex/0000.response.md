### Reasoning:
The provided program aims to determine if it's possible to sort an array using the specified operation (splitting numbers greater than or equal to 10 into their digits). However, there are several issues with the current implementation:

1. **Incorrect Loop Logic**: The main loop only considers adjacent elements and only performs the operation if the previous element is greater than the current element and is greater than 10. This is not sufficient to ensure the array can be sorted. The correct approach would involve checking the entire array after each operation, not just adjacent elements.

2. **Infinite Loop Potential**: If there are multiple elements that need to be split, the current logic may not handle all necessary splits, leading to an incorrect conclusion.

3. **Function `func_1` Misuse**: The function `func_1` is supposed to check if the list is sorted, but the provided comment suggests that it always returns `True`, which is incorrect. The function does correctly check if the list is sorted, but the description in the comments is misleading.

4. **State of the Program**: The comment about the state of the program right before the function call is incorrect. The variable `lst` is not a list of lists; it is a single list representing a single test case, not the entire input.

5. **Handling of Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases, but the logic for sorting within each test case is flawed.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
