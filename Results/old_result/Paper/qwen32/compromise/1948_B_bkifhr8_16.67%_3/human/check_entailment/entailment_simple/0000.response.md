Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by iterating over each test case and applying the operation described in the problem statement to the array. However, there are some critical issues with the provided code that make it incorrect:

1. **Inadequate Handling of Operations**: The code only considers the possibility of splitting the element at the current position if it is greater than the next element and greater than 10. However, this approach is too simplistic and does not guarantee that the array will be sorted after a finite number of operations. For example, consider the array [12, 28, 5]. The code will split 12 into 1 and 2, resulting in [1, 2, 28, 5], but it will not handle the subsequent steps to sort the array properly.

2. **Limited Scope of Operations**: The code only checks the current element and the next element, and it only performs a single operation per iteration. This means that it may not handle cases where multiple splits are required to sort the array or where splits need to be performed on elements that are not adjacent to the current element being compared.

3. **Lack of Iterative Application**: The code only performs the operation once per pair of elements, but the problem statement allows for any number of operations. The code does not have a mechanism to repeatedly apply the operation until the array is sorted or it is determined that sorting is impossible.

4. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` checks if the list is sorted by comparing it to a sorted version of itself. This part of the code is correct, but it is not sufficient to ensure that the array can be sorted by the allowed operations.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the described operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
