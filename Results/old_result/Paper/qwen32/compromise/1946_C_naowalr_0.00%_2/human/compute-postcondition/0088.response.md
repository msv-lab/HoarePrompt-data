To determine what will be printed when the `print(L)` statement is executed, we need to carefully analyze the initial state provided:

- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists representing the adjacency list of a graph.
- `n` is at least 2.
- `k` is the second integer read from input.
- `t` is an integer greater than 0.
- `L` is explicitly set to 50000.
- `R` is explicitly set to 50001.
- `x` is explicitly set to 50000.
- `leftover` is the value returned by the function `dfs(1, 1)`.
- `z` is incremented by 1.
- `i` is set to `n - 2`.

From the initial state, we see that `L` is explicitly assigned the value 50000. None of the subsequent operations mentioned in the initial state affect the value of `L`. Therefore, when the `print(L)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `L`, which is 50000.

Output: **50000**
