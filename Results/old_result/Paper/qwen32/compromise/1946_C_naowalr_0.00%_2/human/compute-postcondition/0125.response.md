The value of `x` is updated to be the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` includes all nodes `b` that are directly connected to `a` as per the input; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `L` is either 1 or 50001; `R` is either 50001 or 100001; `x` is `(L + R) // 2`; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `z` is `z + 1`; `i` is -1; `numCuts` is 0. Regardless of whether `numCuts > k` or `(numCuts == k and leftover >= x)`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
