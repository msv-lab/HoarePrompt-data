To determine what will be printed by the `print(L)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and see if there is any explicit value assigned to `L`.

From the initial state provided:
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists representing an adjacency list for a graph.
- `n` is at least 2.
- `k` is the second integer read from input.
- `t` is an integer greater than 0.
- `L` and `R` are consecutive integers.
- `x` is the last calculated midpoint.
- `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`.
- `z` is `z + 1`.
- `i` is -1.
- `numCuts` is 0.

The only information provided about `L` is that it is one of two consecutive integers, but no specific value is given. Therefore, the most precise description we can provide is that `L` is one of two consecutive integers.

Given this information, the output of the `print(L)` statement would be:

Output: **L (where L is one of two consecutive integers)**
