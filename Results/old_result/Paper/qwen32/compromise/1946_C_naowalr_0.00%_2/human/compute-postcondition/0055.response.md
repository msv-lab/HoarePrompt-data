The given code snippet modifies the adjacency list `adj` by appending `a` to the list at index `b`. This means that the connection between `a` and `b` is now bidirectional, as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` contains `b` and the list at index `b` contains `a`; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input; `L` is the final integer value that satisfies the condition; `R` is `L + 1`; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is the last calculated midpoint; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration; `z` is incremented by 1; `i` is 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The adjacency list `adj` has been updated such that `a` is now included in the list at index `b`, making the connection between `a` and `b` bidirectional. All other variables retain their previous values.
