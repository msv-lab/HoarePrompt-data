Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, where each inner list contains the vertices adjacent to the vertex corresponding to its index; `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree; `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= `k` < `n`; `t` is an integer read from the standard input.
Code of the loop:
for z in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    L = 1
    R = int(100000.0 + 1)
    numCuts = 0
    while R - L > 1:
        x = (L + R) // 2
        numCuts = 0
        leftover = dfs(1, 1)
        if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
            L = x
        else:
            R = x
    print(L)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `adj` is a list where `adj[a]` contains `[b]` and `adj[b]` contains `[a]`; `n` is 2; `k` is 1; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is the first integer read from input; `b` is the second integer read from input; `L` is the final integer value that satisfies the condition; `R` is `L + 1`; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is the last calculated midpoint; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the nodes `b` that are directly connected to `a` in the graph; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `L` is 50000; `R` is 50001; `x` is 50000; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `z` is incremented by 1; `i` is `n-2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` includes all nodes `b` that are directly connected to `a` as per the input; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `L` and `R` are consecutive integers; `x` is the last calculated midpoint; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `z` is `z + 1`; `i` is -1; `numCuts` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
