To determine the new state after executing the given Python code, we focus on the variables that are explicitly modified or introduced by the code snippet.

Given Code:
```python
x = (L + R) // 2
```

From the Initial State:
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the nodes `b` that are directly connected to `a` in the graph.
- `n` is at least 2.
- `k` is the second integer read from input.
- `t` is an integer greater than 0.
- `x` is initially 50001.
- `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`.
- `z` is incremented by 1.
- `i` is `n-2`.
- `R` is 50002.

The variable `L` is not mentioned in the initial state, which implies that its value is unknown or not relevant to the current context. However, since `x` is being reassigned using `L` and `R`, and `R` is known to be 50002, we can express the new value of `x` in terms of `L`.

The new value of `x` will be `(L + 50002) // 2`.

Therefore, the updated Output State is:

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the nodes `b` that are directly connected to `a` in the graph; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `x` is `(L + 50002) // 2`; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `z` is incremented by 1; `i` is `n-2`; `R` is 50002.**
