The code appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Given the initial state, `adj[a]` initially contains `[b]`. After appending `b` to `adj[a]`, `adj[a]` will contain `[b, b]`.

The other variables (`adj[b]`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`adj` is a list where `adj[a]` contains `[b, b]` and `adj[b]` contains `[a, a]`; `n` is 2; `k` is 1; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `a` and `b` are the new integers read from input; `i` is 1.**
