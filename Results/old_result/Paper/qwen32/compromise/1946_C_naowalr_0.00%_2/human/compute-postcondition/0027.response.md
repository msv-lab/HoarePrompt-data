The given code snippet assigns the value of `x` to `R`. Based on the initial state, `x` is 50001, so `R` will now be 50001.

All other variables remain unchanged. Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`adj` is a list where `adj[a]` contains `[b]` and `adj[b]` contains `[a]`; `n` is 2; `k` is 1; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is the first integer read from input; `b` is the second integer read from input; `L` is 1; `R` is 50001; `numCuts` is 1; `x` is 50001; `leftover` is 0; `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and if `numCuts` equals `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`.**
