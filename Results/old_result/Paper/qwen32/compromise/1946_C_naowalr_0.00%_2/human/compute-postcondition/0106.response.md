The code snippet provided updates the value of the variable `R`. The new value of `R` is calculated as `int(100000.0 + 1)`, which results in `100001`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` includes all nodes `b` that are directly connected to `a` as per the input; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001; `x` is 50000; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `z` is `z + 1`; `i` is `-1`.**

In natural language, this means that the value of `R` has been updated to `100001`, while all other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
