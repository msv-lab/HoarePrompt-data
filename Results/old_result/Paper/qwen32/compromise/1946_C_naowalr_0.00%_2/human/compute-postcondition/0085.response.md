Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the nodes `b` that are directly connected to `a` in the graph; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `x` is `(L + 50002) // 2`; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `z` is incremented by 1; `i` is `n-2`; `R` is `(L + 50002) // 2`; `L` is less than 50001; `numCuts` is 0**.

In this output state, the value of `R` has been updated to be equal to `x`, which is `(L + 50002) // 2`. All other variables retain their initial values or states as described in the initial state.
