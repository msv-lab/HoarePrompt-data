### Reasoning:
The given problem involves determining the MEX of an array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally on an array `a`. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it.

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by counting the occurrences of each element in array `a` using a `Counter` from the `collections` module. It then iterates through the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive) to find the smallest integer that either does not appear in `a` or appears exactly once. This integer is printed as the MEX for each test case.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic:
- The program assumes that the smallest integer not in `a` or appearing exactly once will be the MEX after the optimal play by Alice and Bob. This is not necessarily true.
- Alice and Bob's optimal strategies involve more complex decisions based on the parity of the counts of elements and their positions, rather than simply finding the smallest integer not in `a` or appearing exactly once.

To correctly determine the MEX after optimal play, a more sophisticated approach is needed. The optimal strategy involves:
- Alice always trying to maximize the MEX by picking elements that help in achieving a higher MEX.
- Bob trying to minimize the MEX by picking elements that prevent Alice from achieving a higher MEX.

Given the current program's logic, it does not account for these strategic considerations and thus does not guarantee the correct MEX after optimal play.
