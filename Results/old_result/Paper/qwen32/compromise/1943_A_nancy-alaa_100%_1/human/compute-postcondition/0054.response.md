Given the initial state, we need to determine the value of the variable `i` when the `print(i)` statement is executed.

From the initial state, we know:
- `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is the new input integer.
- `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`.
- `first` is True.
- `i` is 1.

The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1 in the initial state. Therefore, when the `print(i)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `i`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
