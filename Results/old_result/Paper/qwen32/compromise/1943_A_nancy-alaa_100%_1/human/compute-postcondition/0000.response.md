In the given task, the for loop iterates over the range of an integer input, which is `t` in this case. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the range function with `int(input())`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the value of `t`.

Since `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\), to ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The other variables `n` and `a` are mentioned in the context of the loop body, which is omitted, and thus do not affect whether the loop will execute or not based solely on the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
