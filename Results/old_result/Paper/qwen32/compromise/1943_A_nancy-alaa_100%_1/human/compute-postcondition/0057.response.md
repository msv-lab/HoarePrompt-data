Let's analyze the given initial state and the `print` statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is a new input integer.
- `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`.
- `first` is a boolean set to `True`.
- `i` is an integer set to 1.
- If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1 in the initial state. There are no operations or conditions mentioned that alter the value of `i` before the `print` statement is executed. Therefore, the value of `i` remains 1.

### Output:
The `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
