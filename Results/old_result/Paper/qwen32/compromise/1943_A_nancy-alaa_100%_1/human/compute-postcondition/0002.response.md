The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `arr`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
