The code snippet sets the variable `first` to `False`. This change does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the new input integer; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is `False`; `i` is `n + 1`.**
