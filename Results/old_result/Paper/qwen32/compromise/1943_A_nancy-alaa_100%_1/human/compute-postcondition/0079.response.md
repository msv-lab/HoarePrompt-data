Given the initial state:
- `n` must be at least 0.
- `i` is not a key in the dictionary `mpp`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(i)
```

From the provided information, we know the value of `i` but not its exact value since it is not explicitly stated. However, we do know that `i` is not a key in the dictionary `mpp`. The value of `i` itself is not dependent on the dictionary `mpp` or `n` in the given context, so we can only describe it as a variable that is not a key in `mpp`.

Output: **i (where i is a variable that is not a key in the dictionary mpp)**
