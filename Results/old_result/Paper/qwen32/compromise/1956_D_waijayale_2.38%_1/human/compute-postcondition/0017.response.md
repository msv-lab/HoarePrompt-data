Functionality: **The function `recursive_maximize_sum` modifies a given array `a` by setting the elements within a specified range `[l, r]` to a uniform value if their sum is less than or equal to the square of the range's length. If the sum is greater, it recursively processes subarrays divided by the maximum element's position within the range. The function also records operations performed in the list `ops`.**
