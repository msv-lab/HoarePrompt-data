The provided code snippet calls a recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)`. This function call does not directly modify any of the variables `l`, `r`, `s`, `mx`, or `pos` in the given initial state. The function call might change the state within the function itself, but those changes are not reflected in the variables listed in the initial state.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with the function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` having been executed.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < n, where n is the length of the array `a`. `s` is the sum of the elements in the array `a` from index `l` to `r` inclusive, and `s` is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1). `mx` is the maximum value in the subarray `a[l:r + 1]`. `pos` is the index of `mx` in the array `a`. The current value of `pos` is not equal to `r` and not equal to `l`, and it remains the index of the maximum value in the subarray `a[l:r + 1]`. The function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been executed.**
