To determine the output state, we need to understand what the function `func_2(a)` does. Since the definition of `func_2(a)` is not provided, we can only assume that it returns three values: `s`, `m`, and `ops`. We will denote these returned values as they are, as their specific computations are not detailed.

Given:
- `a` is a list of integers provided by user input, where each integer is between 0 and 10^7.
- `n` is the length of the list `a`.

The code snippet:
```
s, m, ops = func_2(a)
```

This line of code calls `func_2(a)` and assigns its return values to `s`, `m`, and `ops`.

Since the function `func_2(a)` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact values of `s`, `m`, and `ops`. However, we can state that these variables now hold the values returned by `func_2(a)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, where each integer is between 0 and 10^7; `n` is the length of the list `a`; `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`.**
