To determine what will be printed by the `print(s, m)` statement, we need to understand the values of `s` and `m` which are returned by the function `func_2(a)`. However, the function `func_2` is not defined in the given initial state, so we need to make assumptions based on the typical behavior of such functions in similar contexts.

Given that `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the length of the list `a`, and `s`, `m`, and `ops` are returned by `func_2(a)`, we can infer that `func_2` likely computes some summary statistics or performs operations on the list `a`. Common operations could include calculating the sum, maximum, minimum, or some other derived value.

Since `s` and `m` are specifically mentioned in the `print` statement, we can hypothesize that `s` might represent the sum of the elements in the list `a` and `m` might represent the maximum value in the list `a`. However, without the exact definition of `func_2`, we can only provide a general description.

Let's assume the following:
- `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
- `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`.

Given this assumption, the output will be the sum of the elements in the list `a` and the maximum value in the list `a`.

Output: **s, m (where s is the sum of all elements in the list `a` and m is the maximum value in the list `a`)**
