You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, l, r, ops):
    if l == r:
        if a[l] != 0:
            ops.append((l, l))
            a[l] = 0
        return
    func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)
    if a[l] != r - l + 1:
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
        func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)

#Function 2:
def func_2(a):
    n = len(a)
    ops = []

    recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)
    return (sum(a), len(ops), ops)

#Function 3:
def recursive_maximize_sum(l, r):
    s = sum(a[l:r + 1])
    if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1):
        func_1(a, l, r, ops)
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
    else:
        mx = max(a[l:r + 1])
        pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l
        if pos != l:
            recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)
        if pos != r:
            recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)

#Function 4:
def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (s, m, ops) = func_2(a)
    print(s, m)
    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the input, calculates the sum `s` and the maximum `m` of the list `a`, prints `s` and `m`, and then prints pairs of indices (1-based) representing some operations. The list `a` and the integer `n` remain unchanged.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### 1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array of integers.
   - We can perform an operation a limited number of times (up to 500,000) to maximize the sum of the array.
   - The operation involves choosing a subarray and setting all elements of this subarray to the MEX (minimum excluded value) of the subarray.
   - We need to output the maximum possible sum and a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.

### 2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function seems to be a recursive function that modifies the array `a` in the range `[l, r]` by setting all elements to the MEX of the subarray. It also records the operations performed.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function initializes the process by calling `recursive_maximize_sum` and returns the final sum, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
   - **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`)**: This is a recursive function that divides the array into subarrays and recursively maximizes the sum of each subarray. It seems to check if the sum of the current subarray is less than the sum of its length squared, which would imply that the subarray can be improved by setting its elements to its length (the MEX of a sorted array from 0 to `r-l`).
   - **Function 4 (`func_3`)**: This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the result, and prints the result.

### 3. **Issues in the Program:**
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: The function calls `recursive_maximize_sum` without passing the array `a` and the list `ops`. This will result in a `NameError` because `a` and `ops` are not defined in the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.
   - **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`)**: The function does not correctly calculate the MEX of the subarray. It incorrectly assumes that setting the subarray to its length will always be optimal, which is not necessarily true based on the problem description.
   - **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`)**: The function does not correctly handle the operations list `ops`. It attempts to append operations to `ops` without passing it correctly.
   - **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`)**: The function does not correctly handle the base case when `l == r`. It should handle this case separately.

### 4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program contains several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem. The logic for calculating the MEX and performing the operations is flawed, and the program does not correctly handle the operations list.
