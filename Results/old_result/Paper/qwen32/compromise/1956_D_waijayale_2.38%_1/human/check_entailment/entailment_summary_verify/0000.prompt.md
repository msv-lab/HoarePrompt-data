You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, l, r, ops):
    if l == r:
        if a[l] != 0:
            ops.append((l, l))
            a[l] = 0
        return
    func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)
    if a[l] != r - l + 1:

        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
        func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)

#Function 2:
def func_2(a):
    n = len(a)
    ops = []

    recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)
    return (sum(a), len(ops), ops)

    s = sum(a[l:r + 1])
    if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1):
        func_1(a, l, r, ops)
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
    else:
        mx = max(a[l:r + 1])
        pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l
        if pos != l:
            recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)
        if pos != r:
            recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)

#Function 4:
def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (s, m, ops) = func_2(a)
    print(s, m)
    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the input, calculates the sum `s` and the maximum `m` of the list `a`, prints `s` and `m`, and then prints pairs of indices (1-based) representing some operations. The list `a` and the integer `n` remain unchanged.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code is incorrect due to several issues that prevent it from meeting the problem description's requirements.

1. The function `func_2` calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)`, but `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined within the scope of `func_2`. Instead, the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is defined separately, but it does not have access to the variable `a` and `ops` from `func_2`. This will result in a `NameError`.

2. The function `recursive_maximize_sum` modifies the list `a` and the list `ops` directly, but these modifications are not reflected in `func_2` because `a` and `ops` are not passed as parameters to `recursive_maximize_sum`.

3. The function `func_1` is supposed to perform operations to maximize the sum of the array, but it incorrectly sets `a[l]` to 0 when `l == r` and `a[l] != 0`. This is incorrect because the goal is to maximize the sum of the array, and setting elements to 0 will not help in achieving that.

4. The logic in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` is flawed. The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the MEX of the subarray and set the subarray to this MEX value, but it does not correctly compute the MEX. Instead, it sets the subarray to `r - l + 1` if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`. This is not the correct approach to maximize the sum of the array.

5. The function `recursive_maximize_sum` incorrectly checks the sum of the subarray and compares it to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. This comparison is not relevant to the problem, and the logic based on this comparison is incorrect.

6. The function `recursive_maximize_sum` does not correctly handle the case where the maximum value in the subarray is at the boundary (`pos == l` or `pos == r`). It should handle these cases properly to ensure that the entire array is processed correctly.

7. The function `func_3` is the main function that reads input and prints the result, but it relies on the incorrect logic in `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum`.

To fix these issues, the code needs to be rewritten to correctly compute the MEX of subarrays and set the subarrays to this MEX value to maximize the sum of the array. The logic for handling subarrays and computing the MEX needs to be corrected, and the functions need to properly pass and modify the array and operations list.
