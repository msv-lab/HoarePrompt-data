### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and its annotations to determine if the original assessment is correct.

#### **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
- The function is designed to recursively set elements in the range `[l, r]` to `r - l + 1` if they are not already set to that value.
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function call. It correctly states that if `l == r`, it sets `a[l]` to 0 if it is not already 0 and records the operation.
- If `l != r`, it recursively processes the subarray `[l + 1, r]` and then sets the elements in the range `[l, r]` to `r - l + 1` if `a[l]` is not already equal to `r - l + 1`. This part of the function seems to be logically correct based on the annotations.

#### **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
- The function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` with the initial range `[0, n - 1]`.
- **Issue**: The annotations mention that `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing `a` and `ops` as arguments. This would indeed cause a `NameError` because `a` and `ops` are not defined within the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.
- The annotations correctly state that the function returns the sum of the array, the length of `ops`, and `ops` itself.

#### **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`)**:
- The function is supposed to recursively maximize the sum of the array by dividing it into subarrays and applying the MEX operation.
- **Issue**: The annotations state that the function checks if the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. If true, it sets the subarray to `r - l + 1`. This logic is flawed because the MEX of a subarray is not necessarily `r - l + 1`. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, which could be less than `r - l + 1`.
- The annotations also mention that the function does not correctly handle the operations list `ops`. Since `ops` is not passed to `recursive_maximize_sum`, the operations are not recorded correctly.
- The annotations correctly state that the function should handle the base case when `l == r` separately, but the logic for this case is not explicitly detailed in the provided code.

#### **Function 4 (`func_3`)**:
- The function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the result, and prints the result.
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function call. It reads the input, processes it, and prints the sum and the operations.

### **Conclusion**:
- The original assessment correctly identifies several issues in the program:
  - The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing `a` and `ops`.
  - The logic for calculating the MEX is flawed.
  - The operations list `ops` is not correctly handled.
- These issues prevent the program from correctly solving the problem.

**Final: False**
