You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if infoA.balance != infoB.balance:
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
    return infoB.position - infoA.position

#Function 2:
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join((info.character for info in balance_info))
    print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. The function prints a rearranged version of the string `s` based on the cumulative balance and position of each character. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's break down the logic and compare it against the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Balance Calculation**: For each character in the input string, calculate the balance of the prefix before that character.
2. **Sorting**: Sort the characters based on their prefix balance in increasing order. If two characters have the same prefix balance, sort them in decreasing order of their positions.
3. **Result Construction**: Construct the final string from the sorted list of characters.

### Provided Program Breakdown:
1. **Balance Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the balance for each prefix by iterating through the string and updating the balance based on whether the current character is '(' or ')'.
2. **Sorting**: The program uses a custom sorting function `func_1` which sorts primarily by the balance and secondarily by the negative position (to achieve the decreasing order of positions when balances are the same). However, this custom function is not used directly in the sorting key. Instead, the lambda function `lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position)` is used, which effectively does the same thing.
3. **Result Construction**: The program constructs the final string by joining the characters from the sorted list.

### Class Definition:
The program references a class `BalanceInfo` which is not provided in the given code snippet. However, based on the usage, it is assumed that `BalanceInfo` is a class with attributes `balance`, `position`, and `character`.

### Verification:
- The balance calculation is correct.
- The sorting criteria match the problem description.
- The result construction is correct.

Since the program correctly implements the steps described in the problem, it is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
