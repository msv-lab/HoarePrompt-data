Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code is missing a crucial definition for the `BalanceInfo` class or structure, which is used in the `func_2` function to store the balance, position, and character for each parenthesis in the input string. Without this definition, the code will not run as expected and will throw a `NameError` because `BalanceInfo` is not defined.

To make the code work, you need to define the `BalanceInfo` class or structure. Here is a possible definition:

```python
class BalanceInfo:
    def __init__(self, balance, position, character):
        self.balance = balance
        self.position = position
        self.character = character
```

Once this class is defined, the provided code should work correctly according to the problem description. However, since the `BalanceInfo` class is not defined in the provided code, the code is incomplete and therefore incorrect.
