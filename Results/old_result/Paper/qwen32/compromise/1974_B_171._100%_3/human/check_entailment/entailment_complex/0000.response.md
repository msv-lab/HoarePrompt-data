### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to decode a string that was encoded based on a specific algorithm. The algorithm involves creating a mapping of each unique character in the original string to its symmetric counterpart in an alphabetically sorted list of those unique characters. The decoding process reverses this mapping.

Let's break down the program step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes each test case one by one.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string and the string itself.
   - It then calls `func_1` to decode the string.

3. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - It first creates a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string.
   - It constructs a dictionary (`char_map`) where each character maps to its symmetric counterpart in the sorted list.
   - It then constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding value from `char_map`.

### Issues in the Explanation and Code:

- **State Description Mismatch:**
  - The explanation states that `encoded` is a list of tuples, but in the actual code, `encoded` is a single string (the encoded string `b` for each test case).
  - The state description in the comments is incorrect and does not match the actual usage of `encoded`.

- **Correctness of the Logic:**
  - The logic to decode the string is correct. It accurately creates the mapping and uses it to decode the string.

### Conclusion:

Despite the mismatch in the state description and the actual usage of variables, the logic of the program is correct. The program correctly decodes the string as per the given problem description.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **True**
