Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. The initial state of `n` and `s` for each test case remains unchanged.**

This means that `t` has been assigned the value of the first line of the input, which is the number of test cases. The variables `n` and `s`, which represent the number of coins and their states respectively for each test case, have not yet been assigned values and will be read in subsequent lines of the code.
