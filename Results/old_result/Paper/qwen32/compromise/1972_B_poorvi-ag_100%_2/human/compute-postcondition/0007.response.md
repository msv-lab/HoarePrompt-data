Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` with characters "U" and "D". For each test case, it checks if the count of "U" in the string `s` is odd. If it is, the function outputs "yes"; otherwise, it outputs "no".**
