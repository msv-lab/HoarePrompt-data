You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, x, y) = map(int, data[index:index + 3])
    index += 3
    arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
results = func_1(test_cases)
print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        residue_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            r_x = -num % x
            r_y = num % y
            count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
            current_key = (num % x, num % y)
            residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
        results.append(count)
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list `a` of length `n`. For each test case, it computes a count based on specific residue conditions and returns a list of these counts. If the input list of test cases is empty, the function returns an empty list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
Polycarp considers a pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n) beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it calculates the number of beautiful pairs in the array \(a\). Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes each test case by extracting the values of \(n\), \(x\), \(y\), and the array \(a\).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes a count to zero and a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the residues.
   - It iterates through each number in the array \(a\).
     - For the current number `num`, it calculates:
       - \(r_x = -num \% x\)
       - \(r_y = num \% y\)
     - It checks if the pair \((r_x, r_y)\) exists in `residue_map`. If it does, it adds the count of this pair to the total count.
     - It then updates `residue_map` with the current number's residues \((num \% x, num \% y)\).

3. **Calculating Beautiful Pairs:**
   - The key part of the logic is the use of residues. For a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful:
     - \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) implies \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\) or equivalently \(a_i \% x \equiv -a_j \% x \pmod{x}\).
     - \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\) implies \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\).
   - Therefore, for each number `num`, we are looking for previous numbers that have residues \((-num \% x, num \% y)\) in the `residue_map`.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to count beautiful pairs using residues. Here's why:
- It correctly calculates the residues for each number and uses them to find previous numbers that would form a beautiful pair with the current number.
- The use of a dictionary to keep track of the residues allows the program to efficiently count the number of beautiful pairs in linear time for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided logic.

**Correctness: True**
