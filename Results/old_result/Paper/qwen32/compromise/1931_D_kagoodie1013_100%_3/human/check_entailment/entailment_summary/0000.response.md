### Reasoning:
The program aims to find the number of beautiful pairs in an array `a` for each test case, where a pair `(i, j)` is considered beautiful if:
1. `(a_i + a_j) % x == 0`
2. `(a_i - a_j) % y == 0`

The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the counts of pairs of residues `(num % x, num % y)` as it iterates through the array. For each number `num` in the array, it calculates the required residues `r_x` and `r_y` such that:
- `r_x = -num % x` (to match the condition `(a_i + a_j) % x == 0`)
- `r_y = num % y` (to match the condition `(a_i - a_j) % y == 0`)

It then checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` is already in the `residue_map` and adds the count of such pairs to the result. After that, it updates the `residue_map` with the current number's residues.

The logic is correct because:
- For each number, it calculates the required residues to form a beautiful pair with any previous number.
- It uses a dictionary to efficiently count how many times a specific pair of residues has occurred.
- The order of iteration ensures that each pair `(i, j)` is considered only once.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case as described in the problem statement.
