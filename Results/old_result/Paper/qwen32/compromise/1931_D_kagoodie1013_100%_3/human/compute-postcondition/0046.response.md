The code snippet appends the current value of `count` to the `results` list. The values of `test_cases`, `count`, and `residue_map` remain unchanged. The `results` list now contains one more element, which is the value of `count`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` with at least one more tuple remaining; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the newly appended value of `count`; `count` is the total number of times a specific pair of residues `(r_x, r_y)` has been seen before; `residue_map` is a dictionary with each residue pair `(num % x, num % y)` mapped to the number of times it has been encountered.**
