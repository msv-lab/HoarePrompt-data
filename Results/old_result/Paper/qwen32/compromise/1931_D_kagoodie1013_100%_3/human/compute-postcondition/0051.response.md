The code snippet calculates `r_x` as `-num % x`. Since `num` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed that `num` should be `n` based on the context provided in previous examples. Therefore, `r_x` is calculated as `-n % x`.

Given the initial state, `test_cases`, `results`, `count`, and `residue_map` remain unchanged except for the introduction of the new variable `r_x`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` with at least one more tuple remaining; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next tuple in `test_cases` such that `arr` has at least one element; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the newly appended value of `count`; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is an empty dictionary; `r_x` is `-n % x`.**
