The code snippet updates the `current_key` variable to be a tuple containing the remainder of `num` divided by `x` and the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.

Given the initial state, `num` is `arr[1]`. Therefore, the new value of `current_key` will be `(arr[1] % x, arr[1] % y)`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is incremented by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`; `residue_map` has the key `(first_element % x, first_element % y)` with its value incremented by 1; `r_x` is `-num % x`; `r_y` is `num % y`; `current_key` is `(arr[1] % x, arr[1] % y)`; `num` is `arr[1]`.**
