The provided code snippet contains a variable `num` which is not defined in the initial state. Since `num` is not specified, I will assume that `num` is a variable that should be part of the context, possibly from one of the tuples in `test_cases`. Given the context, it is reasonable to assume that `num` refers to `arr[count]` or another similar element from the current test case being processed. However, since `num` is not defined, I will treat it as a placeholder and describe the output state accordingly.

Given the code snippet:
```
r_x = -num % x
```

The variable `r_x` is calculated as `-num % x`. Since `num`, `x`, and `y` are part of the tuples in `test_cases`, and `count` is initialized to 0, we can assume that `num` is `arr[0]` from the first tuple in `test_cases`.

Let's denote the first tuple in `test_cases` as `(n, x, y, arr)`. Then `num` would be `arr[0]`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` (an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` (an integer such that 1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers, each integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9); `test_cases` must have at least one tuple where `arr` has at least one element; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is an empty dictionary; `r_x` is `-arr[0] % x`.**

In natural language: The variable `r_x` is calculated as `-arr[0] % x` from the first tuple in `test_cases`. All other variables retain their initial values.
