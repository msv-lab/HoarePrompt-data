The code snippet assigns the value of `num % y` to the variable `r_y`. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `test_cases`, `results`, `count`, and `r_x` remain unchanged. The only variable that gets updated is `r_y`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` with at least one more tuple remaining; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next tuple in `test_cases` such that `arr` has at least one element; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the newly appended value of `count`; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is an empty dictionary; `r_x` is `-n % x`; `r_y` is `num % y`.**
