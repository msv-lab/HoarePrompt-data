The provided Python code snippet simply initializes an empty dictionary named `residue_map`. This action does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same for all other variables, except `residue_map` which is now an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` with at least one more tuple remaining; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next tuple in `test_cases`; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the newly appended value of `count`; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is an empty dictionary.**
