The code snippet provided is `results.append(count)`. This line appends the current value of `count` to the `results` list. The other variables (`test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `residue_map`) are not affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state:
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` with at least one more tuple remaining.
- `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next tuple in `test_cases` such that `arr` has at least one element.
- `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the newly appended value of `count`.
- `count` is the accumulated sum of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each element in `arr`.
- `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key `(num % x, num % y)` has its value incremented by 1 for each occurrence of that residue pair in `arr`.

After executing `results.append(count)`, the `results` list will have an additional element, which is the current value of `count`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` with at least one more tuple remaining; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next tuple in `test_cases` such that `arr` has at least one element; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the newly appended value of `count`; `count` is the accumulated sum of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each element in `arr`; `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key `(num % x, num % y)` has its value incremented by 1 for each occurrence of that residue pair in `arr`.**
