Output State: **`test_cases` is an empty list; `results` is a list containing the final accumulated `count` values for each test case.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the `test_cases` list will be empty because the loop processes each test case one by one and removes them from the list. The `results` list will contain the final count for each test case, where each count represents the number of times a specific pair of residues `(r_x, r_y)` has been seen before for each array in the test cases.
