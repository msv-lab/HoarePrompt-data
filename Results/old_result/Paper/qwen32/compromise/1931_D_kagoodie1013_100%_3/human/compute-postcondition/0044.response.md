The code snippet increments the count in the `residue_map` dictionary for the key `current_key`. The value of `residue_map[current_key]` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` with `arr` having at least three elements; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `count` is `2 * residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`; `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` mapped to `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`; `r_x` is `-arr[2] % x`; `r_y` is `arr[2] % y`; `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`; `num` is `arr[2]`. The value of `residue_map[current_key]` is incremented by 1.**
