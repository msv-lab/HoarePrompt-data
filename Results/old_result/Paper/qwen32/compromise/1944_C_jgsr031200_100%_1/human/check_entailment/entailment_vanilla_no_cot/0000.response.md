Correctness: **False**

The provided program is not correct based on the problem description. The main issue lies in the function `func_1(arr)` which is supposed to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. However, the function does not correctly simulate the gameplay or account for the optimal strategies of both Alice and Bob.

Here are the key points that indicate the program is incorrect:

1. **Optimal Strategy Simulation**: The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. It simply counts the frequency of elements and tries to find the smallest non-negative integer not in the array, which is not the correct approach to determine the MEX after both players have played optimally.

2. **Ignoring Player Strategies**: Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it. The current solution does not take into account these strategies. For example, Alice might choose to keep certain numbers in the array `c` to maximize the MEX, while Bob would remove those numbers to minimize it.

3. **Incorrect Logic for MEX Calculation**: The program incorrectly calculates the MEX by simply finding the first number with a frequency less than 2. This does not account for the fact that the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array `c` after the game ends.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the game turns and keep track of the elements in `c`. A more sophisticated approach, such as using a priority queue or a set to keep track of the smallest missing number, would be required to correctly simulate the optimal strategies of both players.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each number
    freq = [0] * n
    for num in arr:
        if num < n:
            freq[num] += 1
    
    # Determine the MEX
    mex = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if freq[i] < 2:
            mex = i
            break
    else:
        mex = n
    
    print(mex)
```

This corrected version correctly counts the frequency of each number and determines the MEX based on the condition that the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that appears less than 2 times in the array. However, this is still a simplified approach and may not fully simulate the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. A more detailed simulation of the game turns would be necessary for a fully correct solution.
