### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to find the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally on the array `a`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input and Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` of size `n`.

2. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a frequency array `freq` of size `n+1` to zero.
   - It then iterates through `arr` and counts the occurrences of each element in `freq`.

3. **Determine the MEX**:
   - The program initializes a counter `cou` to zero.
   - It then iterates through the `freq` array from index `0` to `n`.
   - If the frequency of an element is `2` or more, it skips that element.
   - If the frequency of an element is `1`, it increments the counter `cou`.
   - If `cou` reaches `2` or the frequency of an element is `0`, it prints the current index `i` and breaks out of the loop.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Optimal Play**:
  - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it.
  - The optimal strategy for Alice would be to pick the smallest possible number that maximizes the MEX.
  - Bob, on the other hand, would pick the smallest possible number that minimizes the MEX.

- **MEX Calculation**:
  - If an element appears twice or more, it is irrelevant to the MEX calculation for the purpose of this problem since it does not affect the smallest missing non-negative integer.
  - The MEX is determined by the first number that either appears only once or does not appear at all.

- **Correctness of the Program**:
  - The program correctly counts the frequency of each number.
  - It then determines the smallest number that either appears only once or does not appear at all, which is indeed the MEX after optimal play by both Alice and Bob.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX after both players have played optimally. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
