Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`. Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` (which is initially empty), while Bob wants to minimize it. We need to determine the final MEX of `c` if both players play optimally.
2. **Game Rules**:
   - Alice starts first.
   - Alice picks an element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and then deletes it from `a`.
   - Bob picks an element from `a` and deletes it from `a`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
3. **MEX**: The smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.

### Key Observations:
1. **Turns and Elements**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns, so Alice will make `(n+1)//2` moves if `n` is odd, and `n//2` moves if `n` is even.
   - Bob will make `n//2` moves if `n` is odd, and `(n+1)//2` moves if `n` is even.
2. **Optimal Play**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, so she should try to add the smallest possible integers to `c` that are not yet present.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`, so he should try to prevent Alice from adding the smallest integers to `c`.

### Strategy:
- The MEX of `c` will be determined by the smallest integer that is not in `c` after all moves.
- Since Alice and Bob are playing optimally, the final MEX will be the smallest integer that appears at most once in the original array `a` (because Alice will try to add such integers to `c`).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program seems to be a correct implementation of the strategy described above. Here's a breakdown:
1. **Frequency Count**:
   - The program counts the frequency of each integer in the array `a` using a list `freq` of size `n+1`.
2. **Finding the MEX**:
   - It then iterates over the list `freq` to find the smallest integer that appears at most once in `a` (i.e., `freq[i] == 0` or `freq[i] == 1`).
   - The first such integer found is printed as the MEX.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy to find the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
