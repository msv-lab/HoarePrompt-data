### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in `c`. Both players play optimally, meaning Alice tries to maximize the MEX, and Bob tries to minimize it.

The provided program uses a frequency count approach to determine the MEX. Here is a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Frequency Count**:
   - The program initializes a list `freq` of size `n+1` to count the occurrences of each integer in the input array `arr`.
   - It then iterates through `arr` to update the frequency count.

2. **Finding the MEX**:
   - The program iterates through the `freq` list to find the smallest integer `i` such that `freq[i]` is either 0 or 1.
   - The first such integer is printed as the MEX.

### Evaluation Against the Problem Description:

- **Optimal Strategy**:
  - Alice will try to add the smallest integers to `c` that are not yet present or appear exactly once.
  - Bob will try to prevent Alice from adding such integers.
  - Given the rules, the MEX of `c` will be the smallest integer that appears at most once in the original array `a`.

- **Program Logic**:
  - The program correctly counts the frequency of each integer in the array.
  - It then finds the smallest integer that appears at most once, which aligns with the optimal strategy described.

### Function Summary Validation:

- The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`. It states that the function finds the smallest integer between 0 and `n` that either does not appear in `arr` or appears exactly once, which is consistent with the program's logic.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the strategy to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
