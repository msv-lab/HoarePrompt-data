To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `x` is the smallest element in `inp`.
- `y` is the second smallest element in `inp`.
- `ans` is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.
- `n` is unchanged (though `n` is not used in the print statement, it is mentioned in the initial state).
- `inp` is unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Explanation:
- `x` is the smallest element in the list `inp`.
- `y` is the second smallest element in the list `inp`.
- `ans` is calculated as the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

Given the above, the `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

### Output:
Since the exact list `inp` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated count of elements greater than both `x` and `y`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`)**
