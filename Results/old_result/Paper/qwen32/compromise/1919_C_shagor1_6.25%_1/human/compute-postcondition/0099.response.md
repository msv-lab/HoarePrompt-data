Output State: **`a` is the next element in `inp`, `n` retains its previous value, `y` is equal to `a`, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements.**

In simple terms, `y` now holds the same value as `a`, which is the next element in the list `inp`. The values of `a` and `n` remain unchanged, and `inp` still contains at least two integers.
