Postcondition: **`a` is the next element in `inp`, `n` retains its previous value, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, `x` is updated to the next element in `inp`, `y` and `ans` are recalculated based on the new value of `a`. If `a` is greater than `x`, `y` is updated to the next element in `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `y`, `x` and `ans` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
