The code snippet `x = a` changes the value of `x` to the value of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `x` was initially `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`, `ans` is `0`, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers from the input with at least one element, and `a` is less than or equal to `x`, the new value of `x` will be the value of `a`.

Output State: **`x` is `a`, `y` is `n + 1`, `ans` is `0`, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, and `a` is less than or equal to `x`.**
