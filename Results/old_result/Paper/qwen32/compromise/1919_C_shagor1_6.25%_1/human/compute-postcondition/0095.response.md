The only variable in the loop head is `a`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `inp`. If `inp` has at least one more element, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is the next element in `inp`. For the loop to execute one more time, `inp` must have at least one more element, and `a` should be updated to the next element in `inp`.

State: **`a` is the next element in `inp`, `n` retains its previous value, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements**
