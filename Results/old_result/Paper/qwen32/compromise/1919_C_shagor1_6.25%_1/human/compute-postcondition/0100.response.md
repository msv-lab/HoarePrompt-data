The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of the variable `ans` by 1. The other variables `a`, `n`, `y`, and `inp` remain unchanged. Since `ans` is incremented, we need to reflect this in the output state.

Output State: **`a` is the next element in `inp`, `n` retains its previous value, `y` is equal to `a`, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
