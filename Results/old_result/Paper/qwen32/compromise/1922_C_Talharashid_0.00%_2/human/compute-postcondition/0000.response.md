`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `n`, `a`, `m`, `x_i`, and `y_i` remain unchanged as they have not been assigned any values yet. The precondition regarding the ranges and constraints of these variables still holds.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ `a_1` < `a_2` < ... < `a_n` ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^5, and for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `x_i`, `y_i` ≤ `n` and `x_i` ≠ `y_i`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. Additionally, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely.**
