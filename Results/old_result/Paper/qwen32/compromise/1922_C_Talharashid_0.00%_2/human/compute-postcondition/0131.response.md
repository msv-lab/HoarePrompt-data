The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, and converts each component to an integer, storing the resulting list in the variable `lst`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is the first input integer of the last iteration minus 1, `end` is the second input integer of the last iteration minus 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum difference in the last iteration, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `m` is the same as the input integer, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `t` must be greater than `m + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers from the input.**
