Output State: **`start` is `len(lst) - 1`; `end` is 0; `inc` is 1; `s` is the accumulated sum of absolute differences as calculated by the loop; `mini` is the minimum difference found in the last iteration; `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` and values representing the accumulated `s` at each `start`.**

In this output state, the value of `end` has been changed from `len(lst) - 1` to `0`. All other variables remain unchanged with their initial values.
