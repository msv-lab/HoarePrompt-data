Output State: **`start` is `len(lst) - 3`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is either 0 or 1, `mini` is 11111111, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` and values representing the accumulated `s` at each `start`, `d2[start]` is `s`.**

Explanation: The value of `mini` is explicitly set to 11111111. All other variables retain their initial values as the code snippet does not modify them.
