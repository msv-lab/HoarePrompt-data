Output State: **`start` is the first integer from the new input minus 1, `end` is the second integer from the new input minus 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum difference found in the last iteration, `d1` remains unchanged, `d2` has entries for each `start` position from `len(lst) - 1` to `1`, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `t`, `n`, and `lst` remain unchanged, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`.**

Explanation: The variable `s1` is assigned the absolute difference between the elements of `d1` at indices `end` and `start`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
