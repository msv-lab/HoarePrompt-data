The code snippet `start -= 1` decrements the value of `start` by 1. Given the initial state, the value of `start` is the first integer from the input minus 1. After the decrement, `start` becomes the first integer from the input minus 2.

The values of other variables (`i`, `m`, `end`, `s`, `s1`, `s2`, `d1`, `d2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` is a non-negative integer, `start` is the first integer from the input minus 2, `end` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `s` is 0. If the first integer from the input is less than the second integer from the input, then `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**
