To determine what will be printed by the `print(min(s1, s2))` statement, let's break down the given information step-by-step:

1. **Initial State Descriptions:**
   - `start` is the first integer from the new input minus 1.
   - `end` is the second integer from the new input minus 1.
   - `inc` is -1.
   - `s` is 0.
   - `mini` is the minimum difference found in the last iteration.
   - `d1` remains unchanged.
   - `d2` has entries for each `start` position from `len(lst) - 1` to `1`.
   - `m` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `t`, `n`, and `lst` remain unchanged.

2. **Conditional Assignment of `s1` and `s2`:**
   - If `start` is less than `end`, then:
     - `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`
     - `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`
   - Otherwise (if `start` is greater than or equal to `end`):
     - `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`
     - `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`

3. **Output to be Printed:**
   - The `print(min(s1, s2))` statement will print the minimum of `s1` and `s2`.

Given the above, the values of `s1` and `s2` depend on the values of `d1`, `d2`, `start`, and `end`. Since the exact values of `d1`, `d2`, `start`, and `end` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print(min(s1, s2))` statement will be the minimum of the absolute differences calculated based on the values of `d1` and `d2` at the indices `start` and `end`.

Output: **min(s1, s2) (where s1 is abs(d1[end] - d1[start]) if start < end else abs(d2[end] - d2[start]), and s2 is abs(d2[start] - d2[end]) if start < end else abs(d1[start] - d1[end]))**
