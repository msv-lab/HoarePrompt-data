The code snippet `start += inc` increments the variable `start` by the value of `inc`. Given that `start` is initially 1 and `inc` is 1, `start` will be updated to 2.

No other variables are modified by this line of code, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`start` is 2, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[1]` set to `s` and `d1[2]` set to `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `m` is the same as the input integer, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `t` is greater than `m + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers from the input with more than one element, `mini` remains unchanged if `start - 1` is not greater than -1; otherwise, `mini` is updated to the minimum of `abs(lst[1] - lst[0])` and the previous value of `mini`, and `s` is incremented by 1 if `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`; otherwise, `s` is incremented by `abs(lst[1] - lst[2])`.**
