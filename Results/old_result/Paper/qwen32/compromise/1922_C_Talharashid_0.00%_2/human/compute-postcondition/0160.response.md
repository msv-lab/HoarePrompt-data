Output State: **`start` is 2, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[1]` set to `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `m` is the same as the input integer, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `t` is greater than `m + 1`, `n` is an input integer, and `lst` is a list of integers from the input with more than one element. If `mini` equals `abs(lst[1] - lst[2])`, then `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `s` is incremented by `abs(lst[1] - lst[2])`. In both cases, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[1] - lst[2])`, `abs(lst[1] - lst[0])`, and 11111111. If `start - 1` is greater than -1, `mini` is updated to the minimum of `abs(lst[1] - lst[2])` and `abs(lst[1] - lst[0])`. Otherwise, no change is made to `mini`.**

Explanation: The value of `start` is incremented by `inc`, which is 1, so `start` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
