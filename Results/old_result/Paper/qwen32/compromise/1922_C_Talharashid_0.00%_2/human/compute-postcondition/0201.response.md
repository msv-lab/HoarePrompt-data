Postcondition: **`start` is `len(lst) - 2`, `end` is `0`, `inc` is `-1`, `s` is either `2` if `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, or `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` otherwise. `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from `1` to `len(lst) - 1` and corresponding values of `0` if `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, or `s - 1` if `s` was updated, or `s` otherwise. `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and `d2[start]` is `s - 1` if `s` was updated, or `s` otherwise. `m` is the same as the input integer, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `t` must be greater than `m + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, and `mini` is the minimum of `mini` and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1 > -1`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged.**
