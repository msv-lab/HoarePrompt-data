To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and how it affects the variables `s1` and `s2`, and ultimately the `print` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `i` is 2.
2. `m` is a non-negative integer.
3. `start` is the first integer from the input minus 2.
4. `end` is the second integer from the input minus 2.
5. `s` is 0.
6. If `start` is less than `end`, then:
   - `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`
   - `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`
7. Otherwise (if `start` is not less than `end`), then:
   - `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`
   - `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`

### Analysis:
- The value of `i` does not affect the print statement.
- The value of `m` is not used in the print statement.
- `start` and `end` are derived from the first and second input integers minus 2.
- `s1` and `s2` depend on the values of `start` and `end`, and the elements of `d1` and `d2`.

### Determining `s1` and `s2`:
- If `start < end`, then `s1` is the absolute difference between the elements at `end` and `start` in `d1`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between the elements at `start` and `end` in `d2`.
- If `start >= end`, then `s1` is the absolute difference between the elements at `end` and `start` in `d2`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between the elements at `start` and `end` in `d1`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the minimum of `s1` and `s2`.

### Conclusion:
Since the values of `d1`, `d2`, `start`, and `end` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `s1` and `s2`. However, based on the given conditions, the print statement will output the minimum of `s1` and `s2` as calculated.

Output: **min(s1, s2) (where s1 and s2 are calculated based on the conditions provided)**
