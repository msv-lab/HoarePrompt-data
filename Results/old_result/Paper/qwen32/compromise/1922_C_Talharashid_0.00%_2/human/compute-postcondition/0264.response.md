Postcondition: **`i` is `m + 1`, `start` is `0`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `s` is `0`, `inc` is `1`, `mini` is `11111111`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int value of `0`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int value of `0`, `m`, `t`, and `n` are unchanged, `lst` is a list of integers with more than one element, and `start + 1` is less than `len(lst)`**
