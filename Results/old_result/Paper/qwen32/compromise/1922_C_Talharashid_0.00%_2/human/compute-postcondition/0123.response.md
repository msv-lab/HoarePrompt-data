The code snippet assigns the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` to the variable `s2`. This means `s2` is now equal to `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`start` is the first input integer minus 1, `end` is the second input integer minus 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum difference in the last iteration, `d1` is unchanged, `d2` contains accumulated `s` values, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`, `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**
