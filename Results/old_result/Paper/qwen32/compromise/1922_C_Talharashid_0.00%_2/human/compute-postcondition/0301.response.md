Output State: **`i` remains `m + 1`; `start` is `len(lst) - 1`; `end` is `0`; `inc` remains `1`; `d1` has keys from `1` to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding `s` values; `d2` remains a defaultdict with default int value of `0`; `mini` holds the minimum absolute difference calculated during the last iteration; `s` is the accumulated sum based on the conditions in the loop; `lst` remains unchanged; `m`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged.**

In simple terms, the value of `end` has been changed to `0`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
