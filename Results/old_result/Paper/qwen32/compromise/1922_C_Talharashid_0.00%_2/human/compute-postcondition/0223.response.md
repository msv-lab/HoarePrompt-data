The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between the values of `d1` at the `end` index and the `start` index, and assigns this value to the variable `s1`. The values of `start`, `end`, `d1`, and the conditions on `m`, `i`, `t`, `n`, and `lst` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is the first integer from input minus 1, `end` is the second integer from input minus 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum difference found in the last iteration, `d1` remains unchanged, `d2` has entries for each `start` position from `len(lst) - 1` to `1`, `m` must be greater than `0`, `i`, `t`, `n`, and `lst` remain unchanged, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`.**
