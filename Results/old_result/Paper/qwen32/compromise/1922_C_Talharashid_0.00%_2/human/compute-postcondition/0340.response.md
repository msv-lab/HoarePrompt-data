The code snippet `d2[start] = s` modifies the dictionary `d2` by assigning the value of `s` to the key `start`. Given the initial state, `start` is `-1`, so the dictionary `d2` will have a new key `-1` with the value of `s`.

Output State: **`i` remains `m + 1`; `start` is `-1`; `end` is `1`; `inc` is `-1`; `d1` has keys from `1` to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding `s` values; `lst` remains unchanged; `m`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged; `mini` retains its previous value; `s` retains its previous value; `d2` has a new key `-1` with the value `s`.**
