Output State: **`start` is `len(lst) - 2`, `end` is `0`, `inc` is `-1`, `s` is either `1` if `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, or `abs(lst[len(lst) - 1] - lst[len(lst) - 2])` otherwise, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from `1` to `len(lst) - 1` and corresponding values of `0` if `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, or `s` otherwise, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and `d2[start]` is `s`, `m` is the same as the input integer, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `t` must be greater than `m + 1`, `n` is an input integer, and `lst` is a list of integers from the input. `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` if the condition is met, otherwise `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `d2[start]` has been updated to `s`. All other variables retain their initial values.
