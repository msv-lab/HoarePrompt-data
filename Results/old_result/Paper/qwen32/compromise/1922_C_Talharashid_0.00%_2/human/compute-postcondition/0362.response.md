Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is a non-negative integer, `start` is the first integer from the input minus 1, `end` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `s` is 0, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`, `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`.**

In this output state, the value of `s2` has been updated to be the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
