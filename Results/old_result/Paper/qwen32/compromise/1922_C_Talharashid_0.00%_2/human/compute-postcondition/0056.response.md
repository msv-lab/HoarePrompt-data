Postcondition: **`start` is `len(lst) - 1`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the smaller of `11111111` and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` if `start + 1` is less than `len(lst)`. Otherwise, `mini` remains `11111111`. `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` and values representing the accumulated `s` at each `start`.**
