The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m`, and `t` is unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `m + 1`.

State: **`i` is `m + 1`, `start` and `end` are the values from the last iteration (but do not persist), `s` is `0`, `inc` is `-1`, `mini` is unchanged, `d1` and `d2` are unchanged, `m`, `t`, `n`, and `lst` are unchanged.**
