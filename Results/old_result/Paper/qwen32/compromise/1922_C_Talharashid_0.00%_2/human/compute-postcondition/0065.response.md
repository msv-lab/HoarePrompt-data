The code snippet provided increments the `start` variable by `inc`, which is -1. This means the value of `start` will decrease by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `start` is `len(lst) - 1`
- `end` is 0
- `inc` is -1
- `s` is either 0 or 1
- `mini` is the minimum of `11111111`, `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` if `start + 1` is less than `len(lst)`, and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1` is greater than -1.
- `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` and values representing the accumulated `s` at each `start`.
- `mini` is updated based on the condition provided.

After the execution of `start += inc`, the new value of `start` will be `len(lst) - 2`.

The other variables (`end`, `inc`, `s`, `mini`, and `d1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is `len(lst) - 2`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is either 0 or 1, `mini` is the minimum of `11111111`, `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` if `start + 1` is less than `len(lst)`, and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1` is greater than -1, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` and values representing the accumulated `s` at each `start`.**
