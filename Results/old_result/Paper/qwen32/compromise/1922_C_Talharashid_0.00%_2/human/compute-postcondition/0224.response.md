The code snippet assigns the value of the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` to the variable `s2`. The values of `start`, `end`, `d2`, and `s2` are affected by this operation. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the value of `s2` will be calculated as `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. The values of `start`, `end`, `d2`, `mini`, `d1`, `m`, `i`, `t`, `n`, and `lst` remain the same. The value of `s1` is also unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is the first integer from input minus 1, `end` is the second integer from input minus 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum difference found in the last iteration, `d1` remains unchanged, `d2` has entries for each `start` position from `len(lst) - 1` to `1`, `m` must be greater than `0`, `i`, `t`, `n`, and `lst` remain unchanged, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`, `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`.**
