The code calculates the absolute difference between the values of `d2` at indices `end` and `start`, and assigns this value to `s1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is the first input integer minus 1, `end` is the second input integer minus 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum difference in the last iteration, `d1` is unchanged, `d2` contains accumulated `s` values, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`.**
