The code snippet `s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` updates the value of `s` by adding the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `start` is `len(lst) - 2`
- `end` is `0`
- `inc` is `-1`
- `s` is either `1` if `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, or `abs(lst[len(lst) - 1] - lst[len(lst) - 2])` otherwise
- `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from `1` to `len(lst) - 1` and corresponding values of `0` if `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, or `s` otherwise
- `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and `d2[start]` is `s`
- `m` is the same as the input integer
- `i` is equal to `m + 1`
- `t` must be greater than `m + 1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `lst` is a list of integers from the input
- `mini` is the minimum of `mini` and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1 > -1`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged.

After executing the code snippet, `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.

Output State: **`start` is `len(lst) - 2`, `end` is `0`, `inc` is `-1`, `s` is `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from `1` to `len(lst) - 1` and corresponding values of `0` if `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, or `s` otherwise, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and `d2[start]` is `s`, `m` is the same as the input integer, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `t` must be greater than `m + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, and `mini` is the minimum of `mini` and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1 > -1`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged.**
