Output State: **`i` is `m + 1`, `start` is `0`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `s` is `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])`, `inc` is `1`, `mini` is the minimum of `11111111`, `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])`, and `abs(lst[0] - lst[-1])` if `start + 1` is less than `len(lst)` and `start - 1` is greater than `-1`, otherwise `mini` is the minimum of `11111111` and `abs(lst[0] - lst[-1])` if `start - 1` is greater than `-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int value of `0`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int value of `0`, `m`, `t`, and `n` are unchanged, and `lst` is a list of integers with more than one element. Additionally, `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `s` has been updated to `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
