You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, s is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and '1's) with length 2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5. The sum of lengths of all strings s over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

        print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop will have executed `n` times, and for each execution, it will have processed a binary string `s`. The variable `ans` will hold the accumulated score for the current binary string `s` after processing all its digits according to the rules specified in the loop. The variables `t` and `n` will remain unchanged from their initial values, as they are not modified within the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings.
- Each cyclic shift on a substring of length `r - l + 1` has a cost of `r - l + 1`.
- We need to find the minimum total cost to sort the string.

### Program Analysis:
The program provided does not seem to implement the logic described in the problem. It counts the number of '0's and '1's and calculates a value `ans` based on the counts, but this does not align with the problem's requirement of performing cyclic shifts to sort the string.

### Detailed Breakdown:
1. **Counting Zeros and Ones**:
   ```python
   zeroes = s.count(0)
   cnt = [0, 0]
   ans = 0
   for c in s:
       cnt[c] += 1
       if c == 0:
           ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
       else:
           ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
   ```
   This part of the code counts the number of '0's and '1's and calculates `ans` based on the counts, but it does not simulate the cyclic shifts or calculate the cost of those shifts.

2. **Output**:
   ```python
   print(ans)
   ```
   The `ans` value calculated does not represent the minimum total cost to sort the string as required by the problem.

### Example Test Case:
Let's consider the first example test case:
- Input: `10`
- Expected Output: `2` (since we need to perform a cyclic shift on the whole string which has a cost of 2).

The provided program would not output `2` for this input. Instead, it calculates `ans` based on the counts of '0's and '1's, which does not match the expected logic.

### Conclusion:
The program does not implement the required logic to calculate the minimum total cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.
