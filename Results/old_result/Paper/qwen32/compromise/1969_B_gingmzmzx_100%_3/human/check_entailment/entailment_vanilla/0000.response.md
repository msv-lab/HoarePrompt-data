Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s followed by all 1s) using the minimum cost of cyclic shifts. The cost of a cyclic shift operation on a substring is the length of that substring.

### Key Observations:

1. **Cyclic Shifts and Sorting**: To sort a binary string, you essentially need to move all 0s to the front and all 1s to the back. The minimum cost of doing this can be determined by counting the number of inversions, where an inversion is a pair of characters where a 1 appears before a 0.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost of fixing an inversion (a 1 followed by a 0) is the sum of the lengths of the substrings that can be cyclically shifted to correct the order. However, a simpler approach is to count the number of 1s that appear before each 0, as each such 1 needs to be moved past that 0.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Traverse the string from left to right.
   - Keep a count of the number of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - For each 0 encountered, add the number of 1s seen so far to the cost, as each of those 1s needs to be moved past this 0.
   - For each 1 encountered, simply increment the count of 1s.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)
```

- **Initialization**: The program initializes the count of zeroes and an array `cnt` to keep track of the counts of 0s and 1s encountered.
- **Traversal and Cost Calculation**:
  - For each character in the string:
    - It increments the count of the current character.
    - If the character is a 0, it adds 1 to the cost if there have been any 1s encountered so far.
    - If the character is a 1, it adds the number of zeroes encountered so far minus the count of zeroes up to this point to the cost. This is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the number of 1s that need to be moved past this 0.

### Issues in the Program

The cost calculation logic is flawed. Specifically, the part where the cost is calculated for a 1 is incorrect. The correct logic should be to add the number of 1s encountered so far to the cost when encountering a 0, which is already being done, but the logic for 1s is unnecessary and incorrect.

### Correct Implementation

A correct implementation would be:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        cnt_ones = 0
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == 0:
                ans += cnt_ones
            else:
                cnt_ones += 1
        print(ans)
```

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string as described. The logic for handling 1s is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
