The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `n`. Since `_` is just a throwaway variable used for iteration and does not affect the loop's continuation, the only variable we need to adjust is `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than 1. Since the loop iterates `n` times, at the start of the next iteration, `n` should be decremented by 1 to reflect that one iteration has already been completed.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the input string, `n` is greater than 1 and will be decremented by 1, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is [zeroes, len(s) - zeroes], `ans` is the total count of pairs (0, 1) and the contribution of each 1 to the total number of 0s that come after it.**

To be more precise, if `n` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `k-1` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the input string, `n` is `n-1`, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is [zeroes, len(s) - zeroes], `ans` is the total count of pairs (0, 1) and the contribution of each 1 to the total number of 0s that come after it.**
