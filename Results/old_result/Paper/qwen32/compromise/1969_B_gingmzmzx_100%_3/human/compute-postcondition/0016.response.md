The value of `ans` is updated by adding the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the original string and must have at least one element, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is either [1, 0] or [0, 1] with `cnt[c]` incremented by 1, `c` is the next element in the list `s`, `ans` is updated to `ans + zeroes - cnt[0]`.**
