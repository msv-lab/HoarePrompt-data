The given code snippet initializes a list `cnt` with two elements, both set to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `s`, `n`, or `zeroes`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the original string, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is [0, 0]**.
