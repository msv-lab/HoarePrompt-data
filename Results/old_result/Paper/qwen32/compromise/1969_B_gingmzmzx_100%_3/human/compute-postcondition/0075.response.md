Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, it accepts a binary string `s` with a length between 2 and 2 * 10^5, consisting only of '0's and '1's. The sum of the lengths of all strings `s` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The function returns the result for each test case based on the binary string `s`.**
