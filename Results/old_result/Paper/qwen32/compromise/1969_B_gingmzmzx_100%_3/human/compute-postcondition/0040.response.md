Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the input string and must have at least 2 elements, `n` is greater than 1, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is either [2, 0] if `c` was 0 or [0, 2] if `c` was 1 or [1, 1] if `c` was the opposite of the initial index with a value of 1, `c` is the next element in `s` after the previously processed element, `ans` is increased by `zeroes - cnt[0]`.**

In natural language: The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of `zeroes - cnt[0]` to its previous value. All other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `c`) retain their previous values.
