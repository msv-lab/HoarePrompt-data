To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 10000.
- `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of the set `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`.
- `I` and `R` are lambda functions for reading and processing input.
- `g` is initialized to 0.
- `v1` is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was '<'.
- `prev` is initialized to 0.
- `kp` is incremented by 1 each time `r` was '<'.
- `v2` is initialized to `n-1`.
- `r` is the input string from the last iteration.
- `i` is initialized to 1.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

We need to determine the values of `v1`, `i`, and `prev` at the point where this print statement is executed.

From the initial state:
- `i` is explicitly set to 1.
- `prev` is explicitly set to 0.
- `v1` is described as the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was '<'. Since no specific input `r` is given, we cannot determine the exact value of `v1` from the initial state alone. However, based on the precondition, `v1` is an index in the range `[0, n-1]`.

Given the lack of specific input values, we can only provide a general description of the output.

Output: **? [v1] 1 [v1] 0 (where v1 is the largest index i for which the input r was '<')**
