Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State Analysis:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
2. `n` is an integer read from the input such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\).
3. The sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of \(\{0, 1, ..., n-1\}\).
4. `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers.
5. `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it.
6. `i` is 4.
7. `v2` is 4.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

From the initial state, we know the value of `v2` is 4. However, there is no mention of `v1` in the initial state. This means `v1` must have been defined somewhere in the code that is not provided here. Since `v1` is not defined in the given initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. 

However, the question asks us to provide the most precise description possible based on the given information. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of `v1`.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output a formatted string starting with '?' followed by the values of `v1`, `v1`, `v2`, and `v2`. Given that `v2` is 4, but `v1` is unknown, the output will be:
Output: **? [v1] [v1] 4 4 (where v1 is the value of v1)**
