The code assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Given that `v2` is 5, `v1` will also be set to 5. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it, `i` is 5, `v2` is 5, `r` is the new string read from the input. If the new `r` is `<`, then `v1` is set to 4. `v1` is 5.**
