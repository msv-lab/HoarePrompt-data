The provided code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call does not affect any of the variables in the given initial state. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the standard output immediately. Since no variables are modified, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `i` is 2, `v2` is 2, `r` is the newly read input. If `r` equals '<', then `v1` is set to 1.**
