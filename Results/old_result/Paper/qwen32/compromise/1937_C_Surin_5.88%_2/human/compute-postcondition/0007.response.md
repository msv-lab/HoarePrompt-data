The given code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `v2`. However, there is no initial value provided for `i` in the initial state. Assuming `i` is defined somewhere before this snippet (as it's common in such scenarios), we'll proceed with the understanding that `i` holds some value.

Given the initial state, the only change is the assignment of `i` to `v2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is `i`**.
