The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `v2`. Given that `i` is 5, `v2` will now hold the value 5. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it, `i` is 5, `v2` is 5, `r` is the string read from the input. If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is set to 4**
