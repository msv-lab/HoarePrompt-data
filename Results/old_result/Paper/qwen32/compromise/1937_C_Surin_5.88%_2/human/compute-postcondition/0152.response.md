To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables evolve through each iteration.

### Loop Behavior Breakdown

1. **Outer Loop (`for kp in range(int(input()))`)**:
   - This loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided as input.
   - For each iteration of this loop, a new test case is processed.

2. **Inner Loop (`for i in range(1, n)`)**:
   - This loop is used to find the maximum element in the permutation array based on the comparison queries.
   - It initializes `g` to 0 and `v1` to 0.
   - It iterates through the indices from 1 to `n-1` and updates `v1` to the index `i` where the response to the query `? v1 v1 i i` is `'<'`.

3. **Second Inner Loop (`for i in range(1, n)`)**:
   - This loop finds the second largest element in the permutation array.
   - It initializes `prev` to 0.
   - It iterates through the indices from 1 to `n-1` and updates `prev` to the index `i` where the response to the query `? v1 i v1 prev` is `'>'`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - After both inner loops complete, the code prints `! prev v1`, indicating that `prev` is the second largest element and `v1` is the largest element in the permutation array.

### Final Output State

After all iterations of the outer loop (all test cases are processed), the state of the variables will be as follows:

- `kp`: This variable will be equal to `t`, the total number of test cases processed.
- `n`: This variable will hold the value of `n` from the last test case processed.
- `g`: This variable remains 0 throughout the execution of the loop.
- `v1`: This variable holds the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'<'` in the last test case.
- `prev`: This variable holds the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'>'` in the last test case.
- `i`: This variable will be `n` after the last inner loop completes.
- `v2`: This variable will be `n-1` after the last inner loop completes.
- `r`: This variable will hold the input string from the last iteration of the inner loop in the last test case.

### Final Output State in Specified Format

Output State: **kp is equal to t, n is the integer from the last test case, g is 0, v1 is the largest index i for which the input r was '<' in the last test case, prev is the largest index i for which the input r was '>' in the last test case, i is n, v2 is n-1, r is the input string from the last iteration of the inner loop in the last test case.**

In simpler terms, after processing all test cases, `kp` will reflect the total number of test cases, `n` will be the size of the permutation array from the last test case, `g` will remain 0, `v1` and `prev` will hold the indices of the largest and second largest elements respectively from the last test case, `i` will be equal to `n`, `v2` will be `n-1`, and `r` will contain the result of the last comparison query from the last test case.
