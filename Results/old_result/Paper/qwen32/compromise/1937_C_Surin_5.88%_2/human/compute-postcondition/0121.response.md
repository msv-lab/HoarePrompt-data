The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 3. The variable `n` does not change throughout the iterations, so it remains the same.

The other variables (`t`, `v2`, `r`, and `v1`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted based on the loop's iteration logic.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `i` is 3, `v2` is 2, `r` is the newly read input. If `r` equals '<', then `v1` is set to 1. Otherwise, `v1` remains unchanged.**
