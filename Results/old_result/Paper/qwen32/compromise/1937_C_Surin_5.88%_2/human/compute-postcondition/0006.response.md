To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Here's the given loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For this loop to execute, the range `(1, n)` must contain at least one value. This means `n` must be greater than 1.

Let's analyze the current state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³ (this variable is not directly related to the loop's execution).
- `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴ (this variable is directly related to the loop's execution).
- The sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1} (this variable is not directly related to the loop's execution).
- `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers (this variable is not directly related to the loop's execution).
- `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it (this variable is not directly related to the loop's execution).
- `g` is 0 (this variable is not directly related to the loop's execution).
- `v1` is 0 (this variable is not directly related to the loop's execution).

Given that `n` is already defined as an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute because `n` is greater than 1.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n`. The variable `i` is initialized automatically by the `range` function in the loop head, so we don't need to adjust its initial value manually.

Final State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0**

Since the state already ensures that `n` is greater than 1, no further adjustments are required for the loop to execute.
