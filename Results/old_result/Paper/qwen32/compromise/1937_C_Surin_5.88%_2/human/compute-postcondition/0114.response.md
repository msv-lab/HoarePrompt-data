The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it determines the upper limit of the loop.

The other variables (`t`, `v2`, `r`, and `v1`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `i` is 2, `v2` is 1, `r` is the newly read input. If `r` equals '<', then `v1` is set to 1.**
