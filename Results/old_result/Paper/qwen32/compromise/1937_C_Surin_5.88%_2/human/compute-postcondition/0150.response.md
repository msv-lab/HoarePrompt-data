To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's carefully analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is set to `n`.
- `v2` is set to `n-1`.
- `r` is the newly read input from the last iteration.
- `v1` is the largest index \(j\) for which the input `r` was `'<'`.
- `prev` is the largest index \(i\) for which the input `r` was `'>'`.

### Variables Involved in the Print Statement:
- `prev`: This variable holds the largest index \(i\) for which the input `r` was `'>'`.
- `v1`: This variable holds the largest index \(j\) for which the input `r` was `'<'`.

### Analysis:
Given the nature of the variables `prev` and `v1`, their values depend on the sequence of inputs `r` received in previous iterations. Since the exact sequence of inputs is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe their values in terms of the conditions they satisfy.

- `prev` is the largest index where the input was `'>'`.
- `v1` is the largest index where the input was `'<'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the values of `prev` and `v1` in the format `! prev v1`. Since the exact values of `prev` and `v1` depend on the input sequence, we describe them in terms of their definitions.

Output: **! [prev] [v1] (where prev is the largest index i for which the input r was '>', and v1 is the largest index j for which the input r was '<')**
