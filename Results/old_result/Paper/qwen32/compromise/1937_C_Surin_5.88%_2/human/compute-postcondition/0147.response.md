The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `prev`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n-2`. Therefore, `prev` will now hold the value `n-2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `i` is n-2, `v2` is n-1, `r` is the newly read input from the current iteration, `prev` is n-2, `v1` is the largest index j for which the input r was '<'.**
