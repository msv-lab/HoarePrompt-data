The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 10000, inclusive, for each test case. The sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10000. The lambda functions `I` and `R` are also part of the initial state but are not affected by this line of code.

After executing the line `n = int(input())`, the value of `n` changes to the integer read from the input. The value of `t` remains unchanged, as does the definition of the lambda functions `I` and `R`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10⁴, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it.**
