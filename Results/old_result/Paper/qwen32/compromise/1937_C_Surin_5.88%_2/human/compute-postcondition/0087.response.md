To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³
- `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴
- The sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}
- `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers
- `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is the largest index i for which the input `r` was '<'
- `prev` is 1 if `r` was '>', otherwise `prev` remains 0
- `kp` is incremented by 1 for each time `r` was '<'
- `v2` is n-1
- `r` is either '>' or '<'
- `i` is 1

Since `i` is the loop variable and `n` is the upper bound of the loop, we need to increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration to continue the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2 (assuming the loop is continuing from `i = 1`).

No other variables in the loop head need to be modified as they are not part of the loop control.
