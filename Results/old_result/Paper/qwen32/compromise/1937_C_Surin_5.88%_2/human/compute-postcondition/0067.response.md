The given code snippet includes a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the output device. However, this operation does not affect any of the variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, none of the variables `t`, `n`, `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}`, `I`, `R`, `g`, `v1`, `prev`, `kp`, `v2`, `r`, or `i` are modified by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i` if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise `v1` remains 0, `prev` is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'>'`, `kp` is incremented by 1 if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise `kp` remains unchanged, `v2` is `i`, `r` is the input string, `i` is incremented by 1**.
