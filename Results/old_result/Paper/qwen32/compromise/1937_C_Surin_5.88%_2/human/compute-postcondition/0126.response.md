The code assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Given that `v2` is 3, `v1` will now also be 3. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `i` is 3, `v2` is 3, `v1` is 3, `r` is the newly read input, and if `r` equals '<', then `v1` is 3 (previously 1 if `r` was '<').**
