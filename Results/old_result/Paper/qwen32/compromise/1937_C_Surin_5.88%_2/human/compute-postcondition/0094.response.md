To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and how the variables are defined and used.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`t`**: An integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
2. **`n`**: An integer read from the input between 2 and 10,000 inclusive.
3. **`p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}`**: A permutation of the set \(\{0, 1, ..., n-1\}\).
4. **`I`**: A lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers.
5. **`R`**: A lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it.
6. **`g`**: Initialized to 0.
7. **`v1`**: The largest index \(i\) for which the input `r` was '<'.
8. **`prev`**: Set to 2 if `r` was '>', otherwise it remains 0.
9. **`kp`**: Incremented by 1 each time `r` was '<'.
10. **`v2`**: Initialized to \(n-1\).
11. **`r`**: Either '>' or '<' (as read from the input).
12. **`i`**: Initialized to 3.

### Analysis of Variables in the Print Statement:

- **`v1`**: This is the largest index \(i\) where `r` was '<'. Since the exact input is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `v1`. However, we know it is an index in the range \([0, n-1]\).
- **`i`**: This is explicitly given as 3.
- **`prev`**: This is set to 2 if `r` was '>', otherwise it remains 0. Again, without knowing the exact input, we cannot determine the exact value of `prev`.

### Constructing the Output:

Given the above analysis, the output of the `print` statement will be formatted as follows:
- The string starts with `?`.
- Followed by the value of `v1`.
- Then the value of `i`, which is 3.
- Then again the value of `v1`.
- Finally, the value of `prev`.

Since `v1` and `prev` depend on the input, we can only describe them in terms of their definitions.

### Final Output:

Output: **? [v1] 3 [v1] [prev] (where v1 is the largest index i for which r was '<', and prev is 2 if r was '>', otherwise 0)**
