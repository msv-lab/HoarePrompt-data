To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: An integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
2. **n**: An integer read from the input, between 2 and 10000 inclusive.
3. **p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}**: A permutation of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}.
4. **I**: A lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers.
5. **R**: A lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it.
6. **g**: Initialized to 0.
7. **v1**: The largest index `i` for which the input `r` was '<'.
8. **prev**: The last index `i` for which the input `r` was '>'.
9. **kp**: Incremented by 1 for each time `r` was '<'.
10. **v2**: Set to `n-1`.
11. **r**: The input string from the last iteration.
12. **i**: Set to `n`.

### Key Variables for the Print Statement:
- **prev**: This variable holds the last index where the input character `r` was '>'.
- **v1**: This variable holds the largest index where the input character `r` was '<'.

### Analysis:
Given the initial state, the variables `prev` and `v1` are determined based on the input characters `<` and `>`. However, the exact values of `prev` and `v1` depend on the specific input sequence of `<` and `>` characters. Since the exact input sequence is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Output Description:
The `print` statement will output the string `!` followed by the values of `prev` and `v1`. These values are derived from the input sequence of `<` and `>` characters.

Therefore, the final output is described as follows:
Output: **! [prev] [v1] (where prev is the last index for which the input r was '>' and v1 is the largest index for which the input r was '<')**
