To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴.
- The sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}.
- `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers.
- `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is `i` if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise `v1` remains 0.
- `prev` is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'>'`.
- `kp` is incremented by 1 if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise `kp` remains unchanged.
- `v2` is `i` if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise `v2` remains unchanged.
- `r` is the input string.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has some value between 1 and `n-2` (since the loop will continue as long as `i < n`). For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` remains unchanged.
