The given code snippet only contains `sys.stdout.flush()`, which is used to flush the output buffer. This operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `v2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `i` is 1, `v2` is 1**.
