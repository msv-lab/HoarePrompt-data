The value of `v2` is updated to the current value of `i`. Since `i` is 2, `v2` now holds the value 2. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `r`, and `v1` if it was set) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `i` is 2, `v2` is 2, `r` is the newly read input. If `r` equals '<', then `v1` is set to 1.**
