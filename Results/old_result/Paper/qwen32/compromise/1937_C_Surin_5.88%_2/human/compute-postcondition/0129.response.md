The given code snippet only contains the line `prev = 0`. This line assigns the value `0` to the variable `prev`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `v2`, `r`, `v1`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `i` is n, `v2` is n-1, `r` is the newly read input from the last iteration, `v1` is the largest index j for which the input r was '<', `prev` is 0.**
