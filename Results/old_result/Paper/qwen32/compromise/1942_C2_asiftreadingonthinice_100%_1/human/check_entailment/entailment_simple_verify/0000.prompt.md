You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program attempts to solve the problem but contains logical errors and does not handle all edge cases correctly. Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tt`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y`, and then reads the list of vertices `a`.

2. **Sorting and Initial Calculation:**
   - The list of vertices `a` is sorted.
   - The initial answer `ans` is set to `x + y - 2`.

3. **Processing Gaps Between Vertices:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted list of vertices to find gaps between consecutive vertices.
   - If the gap is exactly 2, it increments the answer by 1.
   - If the gap is even, it calculates half of the gap and appends it to the list `tmp`.

4. **Handling the Circular Nature of the Polygon:**
   - The program checks the gap between the first and last vertices, considering the circular nature of the polygon.
   - If the gap is exactly 2, it increments the answer by 1.
   - If the gap is even, it calculates half of the gap and appends it to the list `tmp`.

5. **Sorting and Using Available Vertices:**
   - The list `tmp` is sorted.
   - The program then iterates through `tmp` and uses the available vertices `y` to form additional triangles.
   - If `y` is sufficient to fill the gap, it increments the answer by the gap value and reduces `y`.
   - If `y` is not sufficient, it breaks the loop.

6. **Final Adjustment:**
   - The program adds any remaining `y` to the answer.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Handling of Gaps:**
   - The program only considers gaps of exactly 2 and even gaps for forming additional triangles. However, it does not handle all possible configurations correctly, especially when the gaps are odd.

2. **Circular Nature:**
   - Although the program considers the circular nature of the polygon, it might not handle all edge cases correctly, such as when the vertices are distributed in a way that maximizes the number of triangles.

3. **General Logic:**
   - The logic for forming triangles and using the available vertices might not be optimal. For example, it does not consider the possibility of forming triangles by connecting vertices in a more strategic manner.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
6 3 1
1 3 5
```
- Here, `n = 6`, `x = 3`, and `y = 1`.
- The vertices chosen are `1`, `3`, and `5`.
- The gaps between the vertices are `2` (between `1` and `3`), `2` (between `3` and `5`), and `2` (between `5` and `1`).

The program will calculate the initial answer as `3 + 1 - 2 = 2`. It will then find three gaps of size `2`, but it will only increment the answer by `1` for the first gap and then use the additional vertex to form one more triangle, resulting in an answer of `4`.

However, the correct answer should be `5` because you can form the following triangles:
- Triangle with vertices `1`, `3`, and `5`.
- Triangle with vertices `1`, `3`, and `2`.
- Triangle with vertices `1`, `5`, and `6`.
- Triangle with vertices `3`, `5`, and `4`.
- Triangle with vertices `5`, `1`, and `2`.

Thus, the program does not handle this case correctly, and therefore, it is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all edge cases correctly, and there are test cases where it does not produce the correct output. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
