The only variables in the loop head are `ii` and `tt`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ii` has been incremented by 1, and the loop will continue as long as `ii` is less than `tt`. 

Given that `ii` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to increase `ii` by 1 again to reflect the start of the next iteration. The value of `tt` remains unchanged as it determines the upper limit of the loop.

State: **`ans` is increased by `y`, `ii` is incremented by 1, `tt` remains the same**.

To make it more precise in terms of variable states:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `ii` was some value, let's call it `x`. After the increment, `ii` became `x + 1`.
- For the next iteration, `ii` will be `x + 2`.
- `tt` remains unchanged.

State: **`ans` is increased by `y`, `ii` is `x + 2`, `tt` remains the same**.

Since we do not have the exact value of `ii` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize it as:
State: **`ans` is increased by `y`, `ii` is incremented by 1, `tt` remains the same**. 

However, to be more specific about the next iteration:
State: **`ans` is increased by `y`, `ii` is the value it had at the start of the previous iteration plus 2, `tt` remains the same**.

For simplicity, if we denote the value of `ii` at the start of the previous iteration as `ii_prev`, then at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`ans` is increased by `y`, `ii` is `ii_prev + 2`, `tt` remains the same**.

But sticking to the general form as per the instruction:
State: **`ans` is increased by `y`, `ii` is incremented by 1, `tt` remains the same**.
