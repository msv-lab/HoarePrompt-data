Postcondition: **`ans` is `x + y - 2`, `ii` is incremented by 1, `tt` remains the same, `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values provided by the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input with at least 2 elements, `tmp` contains one additional element which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if the difference between the `i`-th element and the `(i-1)`-th element of `a` is even, and `i` is 1. The difference between the `i`-th element and the `(i-1)`-th element of `a` is not equal to 2.**
