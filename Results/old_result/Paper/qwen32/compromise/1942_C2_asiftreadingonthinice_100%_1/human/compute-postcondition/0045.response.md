Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `tmp` is a sorted list containing at least one more element, and `i` is the next element in `tmp` after the previous `i`. If `y` was greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `ans` is increased by the value of `i` and `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)`. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
