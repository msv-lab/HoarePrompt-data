The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `tmp`. None of the other variables (`t`, `tt`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `ans`) are modified. Therefore, the output state retains the initial values for all these variables except for `tmp`, which is now an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers provided by the input, and `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, sorted in ascending order; `ans` is `x + y - 2`; `tmp` is an empty list.**
