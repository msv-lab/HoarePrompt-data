Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `ans` is `x + y - 1`, `tmp` is an empty list. Additionally, the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i - 1]` in the list `a` satisfy the condition `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, so `ans` becomes `x + y - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
