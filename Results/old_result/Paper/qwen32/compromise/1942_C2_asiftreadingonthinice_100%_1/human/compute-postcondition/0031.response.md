Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2, and `tmp` is a list containing the halves of the differences for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` that have an even difference but are not 2. If the difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `a` plus `n` is even, `tmp` also includes the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.**
