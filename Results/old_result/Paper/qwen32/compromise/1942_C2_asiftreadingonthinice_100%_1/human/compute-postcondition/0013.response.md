Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers provided by the input, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, sorted in ascending order and has at least 2 elements, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, and `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2. If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even, `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty list.**
