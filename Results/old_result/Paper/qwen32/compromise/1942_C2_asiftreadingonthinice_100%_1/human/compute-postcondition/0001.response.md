The only variables in the loop head are `ii` and `tt`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tt`. If `tt` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, but this does not directly affect the execution of the loop. The value of `tt` is the controlling factor.

For the loop to execute, `tt` must be greater than or equal to 1. The variable `ii` is the loop variable and does not need to be set before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range` function.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure `tt` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` must be greater than or equal to 1**
