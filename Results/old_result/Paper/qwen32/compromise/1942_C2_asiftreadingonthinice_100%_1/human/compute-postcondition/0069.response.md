The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of the variable `ans` by 1. The initial state specifies that `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 4. Since `ans` is not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it has a value before this operation. After the operation, the value of `ans` will be its previous value plus 1.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 4, `ans` is its previous value plus 1.**
