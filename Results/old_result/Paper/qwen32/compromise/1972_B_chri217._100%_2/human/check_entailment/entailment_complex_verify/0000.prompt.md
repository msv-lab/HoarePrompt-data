You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `case`, which is a tuple or list consisting of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". It returns 'YES' if the number of "U" characters in the string is even, and 'NO' if the number of "U" characters is odd.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program against the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves a circular arrangement of coins, where each coin is either facing up ('U') or facing down ('D'). Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins. The player who cannot make a move loses. The task is to determine if Alice (who goes first) will win if both players play optimally.

### Key Points

1. **Game Mechanics**:
   - A player can only remove a facing-up coin.
   - Flipping adjacent coins means if a coin is 'U', it becomes 'D', and vice versa.
   - The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins.

2. **Winning Strategy**:
   - The problem states that the game will end in a finite number of operations and one player will win.
   - The solution provided hinges on counting the number of facing-up coins ('U').

3. **Solution Logic**:
   - The number of facing-up coins determines the winner.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice wins ('YES').
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob wins ('NO').

### Program Analysis

The program consists of two functions:

- **func_1()**: Reads input and returns a list of test cases.
- **func_2(case)**: Determines the winner based on the number of facing-up coins.

### Code Review

1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - Reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins and the string representing the coins.
   - Stores each test case as a tuple `(n, s)` in a list `cases`.
   - Returns the list of test cases.

2. **Function `func_2(case)`**:
   - Counts the number of 'U' in the string `s`.
   - Returns 'YES' if the count is odd, otherwise returns 'NO'.

### Correctness Verification

The provided solution hinges on the observation that the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins determines the winner. This is because each move reduces the number of facing-up coins by one (since one 'U' is removed, and the adjacent coins might flip but do not affect the count of 'U' directly).

- **Odd Number of 'U'**: Alice can always force Bob into a position where Bob faces an even number of 'U', eventually making Bob unable to make a move.
- **Even Number of 'U'**: Bob can always force Alice into a position where Alice faces an odd number of 'U', eventually making Alice unable to make a move.

### Conclusion

The provided solution correctly implements the logic based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. It handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins, which is the optimal strategy as described in the problem statement. There are no edge cases that the program fails to handle.
