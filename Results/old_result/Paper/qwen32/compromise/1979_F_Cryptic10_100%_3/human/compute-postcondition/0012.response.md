Postcondition: **`t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers with at least 1 element, `ops` is a list. If `v2` is greater than 0, `ops` contains one tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `ops` contains two tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`, where `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)` and has been removed from `vx`. `v1` is the value removed from `vx`, and `v2` is a value returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` before the removal of `v1`.**
