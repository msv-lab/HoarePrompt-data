The code snippet `ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]` adds two tuples to the end of the `ops` list. The first tuple is `(v3, 0)` and the second tuple is `(v1, 0)`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000.
- `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to an integer value greater than 2 with `v1`, `v3` (if `v2` is less than or equal to 0), and `v3` removed, and `len(vx)` must be greater than 2.
- `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2` is greater than 0, or the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0.
- `p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx` (with `v1` and `v3` removed if `v2` is less than or equal to 0) and additional elements from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`.
- `p2` is a list containing elements from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`.
- `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`.
- `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)` and has been removed from `vx`.

After the code snippet is executed, `ops` will have two additional tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` appended to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to an integer value greater than 2 with `v1` and `v3` (if `v2` is less than or equal to 0) removed, `len(vx)` is greater than 2, `ops` is a list containing its original elements plus the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, `p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx` (with `v1` and `v3` removed if `v2` is less than or equal to 0) and additional elements from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`, `p2` is a list containing elements from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)` and has been removed from `vx`.**
