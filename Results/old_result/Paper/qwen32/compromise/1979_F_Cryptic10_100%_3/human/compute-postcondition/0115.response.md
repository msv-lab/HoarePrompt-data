To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to break down the expression step by step:

1. **Reverse of `p1`**: `p1[::-1]` reverses the list `p1`. If `p1` is a list, this will create a new list with the elements of `p1` in reverse order.

2. **Concatenation**: `p1[::-1] + p2` concatenates the reversed list `p1` with the list `p2`. This creates a new list that contains all elements of the reversed `p1` followed by all elements of `p2`.

3. **Mapping to Strings**: `map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)` applies the `str` function to each element of the concatenated list, converting each element to a string.

4. **Joining Strings**: `' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2))` joins all the string elements with a space `' '` as the separator, resulting in a single string.

5. **Formatting and Printing**: `'! %s' % ...` formats the joined string by placing it after the `'!'` and a space, and then prints the result.

Given the initial state, we don't have explicit values for `p1` and `p2`. Therefore, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

**Output Description**:
The print statement will output an exclamation mark `'!'` followed by a space and then the elements of the reversed list `p1` concatenated with the list `p2`, with each element separated by a space.

Output: **! [reversed p1 elements] [p2 elements] (where [reversed p1 elements] are the elements of p1 in reverse order and [p2 elements] are the elements of p2)**
