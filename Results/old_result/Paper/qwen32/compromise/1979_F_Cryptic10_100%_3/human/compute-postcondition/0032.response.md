The code snippet checks if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`. If it is, it appends `v1` to `p2`; otherwise, it appends `v1` to `p1`. 

Given that `p2` is initially an empty list and `p1` contains the elements of `vx`, which is a set of integers with 1 or 2 elements, the impact of the code will be to append `v1` to either `p1` or `p2` based on the condition.

Since the exact values of `v1` and `v2` are not provided, we can't determine the specific values of `p1` or `p2` after the operation. However, we can describe the state changes in a general way.

If `p1[-1]` (the last element of `p1`) is equal to `v2`, then `p2` will have `v1` appended to it, and `p1` will remain unchanged. If `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, then `p1` will have `v1` appended to it, and `p2` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers with 1 or 2 elements, `ops` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed and must contain at least one tuple, `p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx` with `v1` appended if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, or `p1` remains unchanged if `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`, `p2` is an empty list with `v1` appended if `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`, or `p2` remains unchanged if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`.**
