The code snippet defines a lambda function `q` that takes an integer `d` as an argument, prints a query formatted as `? d` to the standard output, and then reads a line of input from the standard input, splitting it into integers and mapping them to a map object. The function `q` does not explicitly return a value, but the result of the `map` operation is the result of the lambda function.

Output State: **The function `func()` does not take any input parameters. The input is handled through standard input as described in the problem statement: first an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, followed by t lines each containing a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of vertices in the graph for each test case. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The function must interact with the system by outputting queries and reading responses as specified in the problem statement to determine a Hamiltonian path for each test case. The lambda function `q` is defined to print a query and read a response.**

In simpler terms: The initial state remains unchanged except that the lambda function `q` is now defined. The function `func()` still does not take any input parameters and must handle input and output as specified. The lambda function `q` allows printing a query and reading a response.
