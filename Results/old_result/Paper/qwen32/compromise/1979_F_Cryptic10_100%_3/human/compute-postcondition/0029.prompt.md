Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input value, `ops` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers with at least 1 element, `ops` is a list. If `v2` is greater than 0, `ops` contains one tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `ops` contains two tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`, where `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)` and has been removed from `vx`. `v1` is the value removed from `vx`, and `v2` is a value returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` before the removal of `v1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers with at least 2 elements (after removing `v1`), `ops` is a list. If `v2` > 0, then `ops` includes the tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` is not greater than 0, then `vx` has an additional element `v3` removed, and `ops` includes two additional elements `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`. `v1` is `q(len(vx) - 2)[0]`, and `v2` is `q(len(vx) - 2)[1]`. If `v2` is not greater than 0, `v3` is the first element of the tuple returned by `q(0)`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000. If `v2` > 0, then `vx` is a set of integers with at least 2 elements (after removing `v1`), `ops` is a list that now includes the tuple `(v1, v2)`, and `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`. Otherwise, `vx` is a set of integers with at least 1 element (after removing `v1` and `v3`), `ops` is a list with two additional elements `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, and `v3` is the first value returned by `q(0)` and has been removed from `vx`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
