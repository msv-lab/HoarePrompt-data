Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any input parameters. It reads from standard input, where the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` lines each containing a single integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of vertices in the graph for each test case. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The function interacts with the system by outputting queries and reading responses to determine a Hamiltonian path for each test case.**
