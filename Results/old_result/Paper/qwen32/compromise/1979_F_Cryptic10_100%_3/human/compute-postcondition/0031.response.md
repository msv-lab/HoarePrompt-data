To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `(v1, v2) in ops[::-1]`.

This means that the loop will execute if `ops` is not empty, as `ops[::-1]` is a reversed version of the `ops` list. If `ops` contains at least one tuple, the loop will execute. 

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000.
- `vx` is a set of integers with 1 or 2 elements.
- `ops` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed.
- `p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx`.
- `p2` is an empty list.

The only variable in the loop head that we can adjust is `ops`. To ensure that the loop executes, `ops` must contain at least one tuple.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers with 1 or 2 elements, `ops` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed and must contain at least one tuple, `p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx`, `p2` is an empty list**.
