You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    4
    
    3 2 1 3

    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    buffer = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
        if n >= 3:
            q = [0 for j in range(n + 1)]
            for j in range(n):
                q[w[j]] += 1
            eta = []
            for j in range(n + 1):
                if q[j] > 0:
                    eta.append(j)
            eta_ln = len(eta)
            rho = q[eta[0]]
            if eta_ln == 1:
                print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
            else:
                res = q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6
                for j in range(1, eta_ln):
                    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
                    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
                    rho += q[eta[j]]
                print(res)
        else:
            print(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of ways to choose three integers from the list such that at least two of them are the same. If `n` is less than 3, it prints 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. The program focuses on counting combinations of sticks with the same length and does not correctly apply the triangle inequality theorem, which is essential for determining if three sticks can form a triangle.

The triangle inequality theorem states that for three sticks of lengths \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(a \leq b \leq c\)), they can form a triangle if and only if \(a + b > c\). The given program does not check this condition.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1 2 3 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- The sticks have lengths \(2^1 = 2\), \(2^2 = 4\), \(2^3 = 8\), and \(2^3 = 8\).
- Possible combinations of 3 sticks are: (2, 4, 8), (2, 4, 8), (2, 8, 8), (4, 8, 8).
- Only (2, 8, 8) and (4, 8, 8) satisfy the triangle inequality (since 2 + 8 > 8 and 4 + 8 > 8).

**Actual Output of Given Program:**
```
0
```

The program incorrectly calculates the number of ways to form a triangle, as it does not properly apply the triangle inequality theorem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
