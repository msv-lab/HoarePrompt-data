The code snippet `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `eta` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `eta` will contain the single element `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `buffer` is an empty list; `w` is a list of integers provided by the new input; if `n` >= 3, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. If `eta_ln` is equal to 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`. Otherwise, `rho` is the sum of `q[eta[j]]` for `j` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1`, and `eta_ln` is greater than 1. If `n` < 3, the state of the variables remains unchanged as described; `i` is `i + 1`; `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `j` in `w`; `eta` is a list containing the single element `j`; the current value of `q[j]` is greater than 0.**
