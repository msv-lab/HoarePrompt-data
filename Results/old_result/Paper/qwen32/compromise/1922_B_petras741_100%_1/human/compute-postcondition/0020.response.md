The code snippet appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Given that `j` is 4, `eta` will now contain the integer 4. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `buffer`, `w`, `q`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 3; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `buffer` is an empty list; `w` is a list of integers provided by the input; `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers; `eta` is a list containing the integer 4; `j` is 4**.
