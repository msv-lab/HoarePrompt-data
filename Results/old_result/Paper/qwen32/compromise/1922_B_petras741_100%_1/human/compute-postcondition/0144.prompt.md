Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; `buffer` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
    if n >= 3:
        q = [(0) for j in range(n + 1)]
        for j in range(n):
            q[w[j]] += 1
        eta = []
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if q[j] > 0:
                eta.append(j)
        eta_ln = len(eta)
        rho = q[eta[0]]
        if eta_ln == 1:
            print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
        else:
            res = q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6
            for j in range(1, eta_ln):
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
                rho += q[eta[j]]
            print(res)
    else:
        print(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; `buffer` is an empty list; `w` is a list of integers provided by the input. If `n` >= 3, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. If `eta_ln` is equal to 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`. Otherwise, `rho` is the sum of `q[eta[j]]` for `j` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1`, and `eta_ln` is greater than 1. If `n` < 3, the state of the variables remains unchanged as described in the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the newly input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; `buffer` is an empty list; `w` is a list of integers provided by the new input; `i` is `i + 1`. If `n` >= 3, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `j` in `w`; `eta` contains all indices `j` (from `0` to `n`) for which `q[j] > 0`; `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. If `eta_ln` equals 1, `rho` is assigned the value of `q[eta[0]]`. If `eta_ln` is greater than or equal to 2, `rho` is the sum of `q[eta[j]]` for all `j` from `0` to `eta_ln - 1` and `res` is the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` and `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for all `j` from `1` to `eta_ln - 1`. If `n` < 3, the state of the variables remains unchanged as described in the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the newly input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `buffer` is an empty list; `w` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input; `i` is an integer. If `n` >= 3, then `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`; `j` is updated to `n` if `eta_ln == 1` or `eta_ln - 1` otherwise; `eta` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n` for which `q[j]` is greater than 0; `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`; `rho` is `q[eta[0]]` if `eta_ln == 1`, otherwise `rho` is calculated as `q[eta[0]] + (eta_ln - 1) * q[eta[1]] + (eta_ln - 2) * q[eta[2]] + ... + 2 * q[eta[eta_ln - 2]] + q[eta[eta_ln - 1]]`. If `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `res` is the sum of the initial `res` and the contributions from each `q[eta[j]]` for `j` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1` as described. If `n` < 3, then `i` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
