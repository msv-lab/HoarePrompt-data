The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the loop statement `for j in range(n):`, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

So, for the next iteration, `j` should be 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the newly input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input, `i` is `i + 1`, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[0]]` is incremented by 1 and `q[w[1]]` is also incremented by 1, `j` is 2**
