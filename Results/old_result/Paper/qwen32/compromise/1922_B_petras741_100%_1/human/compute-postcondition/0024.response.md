Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 3; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `buffer` is an empty list; `w` is a list of integers provided by the input; `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers; `j` is 5. If `q[5]` is greater than 0, `eta` is a list containing the integers 4 and 5 if `q[4]` is also greater than 0, otherwise `eta` is a list containing the integer 5. If `q[5]` is not greater than 0, `eta` remains unchanged from its initial state (either an empty list or a list containing the integer 4).**
