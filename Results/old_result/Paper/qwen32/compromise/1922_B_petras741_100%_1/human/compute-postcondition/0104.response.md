The code snippet `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value at the index `w[j]` in the list `q` by 1. Given the initial state, the value of `j` is 1, so `q[w[1]]` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the newly input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input, `i` is `i + 1`, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[0]]` is incremented by 1 and `q[w[1]]` is also incremented by 1, `j` is 1**.
