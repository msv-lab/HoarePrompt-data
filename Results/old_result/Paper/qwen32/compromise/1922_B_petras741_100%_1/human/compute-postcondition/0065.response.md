Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `buffer` is an empty list; `w` is a list of integers provided by the new input; `i` is `i + 1`; `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `j` in `w`; if `n` >= 3 and `q[j] > 0`, `eta` is a list containing the single element `j`. If `n` < 3 or `q[j] <= 0`, `eta` remains an empty list.**
