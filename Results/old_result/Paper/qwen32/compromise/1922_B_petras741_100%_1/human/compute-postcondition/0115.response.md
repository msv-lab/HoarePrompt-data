Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `buffer` is an empty list; `w` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input; `i` is an integer; `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`; `j` is the previous value of `j` plus 1; `eta` is a list containing the integer 0 if `q[j]` is greater than 0, and now also includes the current value of `j` if `q[j]` was greater than 0.**
