Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; `buffer` is an empty list; `w` is a list of integers provided by the new input; if `n` >= 3, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. If `eta_ln` is equal to 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`. Otherwise, `rho` is the sum of `q[eta[j]]` for `j` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1`, and `eta_ln` is greater than 1. If `n` < 3, the state of the variables remains unchanged as described; `i` is `i + 1`; `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `j` in `w`; `eta` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n + 1):
    if q[j] > 0:
        eta.append(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `buffer` is an empty list; `w` is a list of integers provided by the new input; `i` is `i + 1`; `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `j` in `w`; if `n` >= 3 and `q[j] > 0`, `eta` is a list containing the single element `j`. If `n` < 3 or `q[j] <= 0`, `eta` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `buffer` is an empty list; `w` is a list of integers provided by the new input; `i` is `i + 1`; `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `j` in `w`. If `q[j] > 0`, `eta` contains the newly appended `j`. If `q[j] <= 0`, `eta` remains unchanged. `j` is `j + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `buffer` is an empty list; `w` is a list of integers provided by the new input; `i` is `i + 1`; `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `j` in `w`. If `q[j] > 0`, `eta` contains the newly appended `j`. If `q[j] <= 0`, `eta` remains unchanged; `j` is `j + 1`. If `q[j] > 0`, `eta` now includes the newly appended `j`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
