The code snippet `n = int(input())` will read an integer input and assign it to the variable `n`. This means the previous value of `n` is overwritten by the new input value. The values of `t`, `a`, and `buffer` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; `buffer` is an empty list**.
