Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` must be greater than 0, `t` is at least 1 and has been decremented by 1, `num` is 2, `i` is `k - 1` if `m` is 1 or greater, otherwise `i` remains `k - 1`, `c` is the first integer from the new input, `r` is the second integer from the new input, and `c` is not equal to `r`.**

The value of `num` has been incremented by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
