The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. Specifically, the loop will execute if `m` is at least 3 because the range starts from 3 (`range(3, m + 1)`).

Given the conditions:
- `m` is `n - num` which is not equal to 0 and not equal to 1.
- The loop will execute if `m` is at least 3.

Before the loop starts, `i` is -1, which is fine as it will be set to 3 on the first iteration of the loop. The value of `m` needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute, i.e., `m` must be at least 3.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `m` is at least 3. Given that `m = n - num`, we need to ensure that `n - num` is at least 3.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `t` is at least 0, `i` is -1, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s from each of the `k` iterations (i.e., `k + y` where `y` is the number of times `c != r`), `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements, where the first element is 1, the second element is 3, and the rest are 0**
