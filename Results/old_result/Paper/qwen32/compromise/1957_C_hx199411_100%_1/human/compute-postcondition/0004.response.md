Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n; `num` is 0.**

Natural language: The variable `num` has been assigned the value 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
