The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input, splits them, converts them to integers, and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. The variables `i` and `k` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the value of `i` remains `i + 1`, and `k` remains greater than `i + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` is greater than `i + 1`, `c` is the first integer from input, `r` is the second integer from input.**
