The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. This means the initial values of `c` and `r` are overwritten by the new input values. The values of `n`, `k`, `t`, `i`, and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `t` is at least 1 and has been decremented by 1, `i` is 0, `c` is the first integer from the new input, `r` is the second integer from the new input. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is 2. Otherwise, `num` is 4.**
