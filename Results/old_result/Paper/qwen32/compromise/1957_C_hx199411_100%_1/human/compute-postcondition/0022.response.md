To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to consider the loop's behavior and the values it accumulates based on the input conditions.

The loop runs `k` times, and in each iteration, it reads two integers `c` and `r` from the input. Depending on whether `c` equals `r`, it increments `num` by 1 or 2.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the final state:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1.
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
   - `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n.
   - `num` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs `k` times. In each iteration:
     - It reads two integers `c` and `r`.
     - If `c == r`, it increments `num` by 1.
     - Otherwise, it increments `num` by 2.

3. **Final State**:
   - After `k` iterations, `num` will be the sum of 1s and 2s based on the conditions encountered in each iteration.
   - `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

In natural language, the final output state is that the variable `num` will hold the total accumulated value after `k` iterations, where each iteration either adds 1 or 2 to `num` based on whether the two input integers `c` and `r` are equal or not. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the conditions encountered in each of the `k` iterations.**
