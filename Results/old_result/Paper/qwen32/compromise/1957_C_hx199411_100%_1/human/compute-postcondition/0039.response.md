To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the nature of the loop and how it modifies the `dp` array. The loop iterates from `i = 3` to `i = m`, updating the `dp` array based on the formula:

\[ dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \mod (10^9 + 7) \]

Given the initial values:
- `dp[1] = 1`
- `dp[2] = 3`

And the first three iterations:
- After 1st iteration (`i = 3`): `dp[3] = (dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) = (3 + 2 * 1 * 2) % (10^9 + 7) = 7`
- After 2nd iteration (`i = 4`): `dp[4] = (dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) = (7 + 3 * 3 * 2) % (10^9 + 7) = 25`
- After 3rd iteration (`i = 5`): `dp[5] = (dp[4] + 4 * dp[3] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) = (25 + 4 * 7 * 2) % (10^9 + 7) = 81`

The loop continues until `i = m`. Therefore, the final output state will be the state of the `dp` array after `i` has reached `m`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `m`, we can only describe the final state in a general form. The final state will be:

- `dp[1] = 1`
- `dp[2] = 3`
- `dp[3] = 7`
- `dp[4] = 25`
- `dp[5] = 81`
- ...
- `dp[m]` will be calculated based on the above formula until `i = m`.

The exact values of `dp[i]` for `i > 5` will depend on the value of `m`. However, the final output state after the loop finishes executing will be the `dp` array fully populated up to `dp[m]`.

Output State: **The `dp` array will be fully populated from `dp[1]` to `dp[m]` with each element calculated using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m` remain unchanged as per the initial state.**
