The given print statement is `print(1)`. This statement directly prints the integer `1` to the output. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m` do not affect the output of this specific print statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The print statement is `print(1)`, which means it will print the integer `1`.
2. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m` are provided in the initial state, but they are not used in the print statement.
3. Therefore, the output is simply the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
