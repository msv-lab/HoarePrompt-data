The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. Let's analyze the given initial state to ensure that we understand the context, even though it does not directly influence the output of the `print` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `n`: An input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
- `k`: An input integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq n\).
- `t`: It is mentioned as `t - 1`, but `t` is not defined in the initial state, so this part seems incomplete or irrelevant to the print statement.
- `num`: The sum of `k` increments, each being either 1 or 2.
- `m`: Defined as `n - num` and it is stated that `m` equals 0.
- `i`: Defined as `k - 1`.
- `c`: The last first integer from the input.
- `r`: The last second integer from the input.

### Analysis:
The `print(1)` statement in the code will output the integer `1` regardless of the values of the variables `n`, `k`, `t`, `num`, `m`, `i`, `c`, and `r`. These variables are not used in the `print` statement, so their values do not affect the output.

### Final Output:
Output: **1**
