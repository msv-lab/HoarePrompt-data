The code snippet provided is `num += 2`, which means the variable `num` is incremented by 2. The initial state does not mention the initial value of `num`, so we will denote its new value as `num` plus 2. The other variables `i`, `k`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` is greater than `i + 1`, `c` is the first integer from input, `r` is the second integer from input, `num` is `num + 2`**.
