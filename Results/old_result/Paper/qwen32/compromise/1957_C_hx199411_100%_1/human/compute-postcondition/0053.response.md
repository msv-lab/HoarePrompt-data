Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer such that `k` must be greater than 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `num` is either 1 or 2, `m` is `n - num`, `i` is 0, `c` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input, and `c` is equal to `r` if `num` is 1, otherwise `c` is not equal to `r`.**
