The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3, and `m` must still be at least 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `t` is at least 0, `i` is 3, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s from each of the `k` iterations (i.e., `k + y` where `y` is the number of times `c != r`), `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements, where the first element is 1, the second element is 3, the third element is 5, and the rest are 0.**
