The code snippet `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads two integers from the input, splits them by a space, and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r` respectively. This means the values of `c` and `r` will be updated based on the new input, and all other variables will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer such that `k` must be greater than 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `num` is either 1 or 2, `m` is `n - num`, `i` is 1, `c` is the first integer from the new input, `r` is the second integer from the new input**.
