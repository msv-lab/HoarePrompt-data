The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `k` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer such that `k` must be greater than 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `num` is either 1 or 2, `m` is `n - num`, `i` is 1, `c` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input, and `c` is equal to `r` if `num` is 1, otherwise `c` is not equal to `r`**
