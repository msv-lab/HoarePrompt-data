Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `c` and `r` are integers read from input, `num` is an integer between 2 and 4 inclusive, and `i` is incremented by 1 if `c` does not equal `r`. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `num` is either 3 or 4.**
