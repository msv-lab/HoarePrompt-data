To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables change with each iteration.

The loop iterates `k` times, and in each iteration, it reads two integers `c` and `r`. Depending on whether `c` equals `r`, it increments `num` by 1 or 2. The variable `i` is used as the loop index, decrementing from `k-1` to 0.

Given the initial state and the outputs after the first three iterations, we can infer the following:
- After 1 iteration, `num` is 1 if `c == r` and 2 if `c != r`.
- After 2 iterations, `num` is 2 if both pairs had `c == r`, 3 if one pair had `c == r` and the other `c != r`, and 4 if both pairs had `c != r`.
- After 3 iterations, `num` can be 3 if two pairs had `c == r` and the third had `c != r`, 4 if one pair had `c == r` and the other two had `c != r`, or 6 if all three pairs had `c != r`.

Following this pattern, after `k` iterations, `num` will be the sum of the increments from each iteration. Each iteration adds either 1 or 2 to `num`, depending on whether `c` equals `r`.

Therefore, the final output state after all `k` iterations will be:
- `n` remains the same.
- `k` remains the same.
- `t` remains the same (having been decremented by 1 initially).
- `i` will be `-1` after the loop completes, as it decrements from `k-1` to `0` and then exits the loop.
- `c` and `r` will be the values from the last iteration, but they are not relevant to the final state of `num`.
- `num` will be the sum of 1s and 2s from each of the `k` iterations.

Let's denote the number of times `c == r` as `x` and the number of times `c != r` as `y`. We know that `x + y = k`. Therefore, `num` will be `x + 2y`. Since `x + y = k`, we can rewrite `num` as `k + y`.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `t` is at least 1 and has been decremented by 1, `i` is -1, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s from each of the `k` iterations (i.e., `k + y` where `y` is the number of times `c != r`).**

In simpler terms, `num` is the total count of 1s and 2s added over `k` iterations based on whether `c` equals `r` or not.
