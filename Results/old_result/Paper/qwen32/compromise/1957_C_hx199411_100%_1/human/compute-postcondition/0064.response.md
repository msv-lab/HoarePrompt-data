To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and how the variables change with each iteration. The loop iterates `k` times, and in each iteration, it reads a pair of integers `c` and `r`. Depending on whether `c` equals `r`, it increments `num` by 1 or 2.

Let's summarize the changes:
- `num` starts at 0.
- For each iteration, if `c == r`, `num` is incremented by 1.
- For each iteration, if `c != r`, `num` is incremented by 2.
- The loop runs `k` times, so `num` will be incremented a total of `k` times, with each increment being either 1 or 2.

Given that `k` iterations have occurred, the final value of `num` will be the sum of `k` increments, each being either 1 or 2. The exact value of `num` can range from `k` (if all increments are 1) to `2k` (if all increments are 2).

The variable `m` is defined as `n - num`. Therefore, the final value of `m` will be `n` minus the final value of `num`.

The variables `c` and `r` are the last pair of integers read from the input, and they do not affect the final state other than contributing to the final value of `num`.

The final output state will be:
- `n` remains the same.
- `k` remains the same.
- `t` remains `t - 1`.
- `num` is the sum of `k` increments, each being either 1 or 2.
- `m` is `n - num`.
- `i` is `k - 1` (since the loop runs from 0 to `k-1`).
- `c` and `r` are the last pair of integers read from the input.

Thus, the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `t` is `t - 1`, `num` is the sum of `k` increments, each being either 1 or 2, `m` is `n - num`, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` is the last first integer from the input, `r` is the last second integer from the input.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `num` will be the total sum of the increments (each increment being 1 or 2 based on the condition `c == r`), `m` will be `n` minus this sum, and `i` will be `k - 1` indicating the loop has completed its `k` iterations.
