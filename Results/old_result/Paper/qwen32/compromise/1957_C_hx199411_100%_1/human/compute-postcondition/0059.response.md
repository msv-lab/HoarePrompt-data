The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `k`.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer such that `k` must be greater than 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `num` is either 2 or 3 or 3 or 4, `m` is `n - num`, `i` is 2, `c` is the first integer from the new input, `r` is the second integer from the new input. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 2 or 3. Otherwise, `num` is 3 or 4.**
