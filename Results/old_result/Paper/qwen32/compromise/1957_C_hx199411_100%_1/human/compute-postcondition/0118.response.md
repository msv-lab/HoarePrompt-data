The provided code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` based on the previous values of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`. Given the initial state, `i` is initially -1, but the code snippet suggests that `i` is used as an index into the `dp` list, implying that `i` should be a non-negative integer within the bounds of the list.

Since `i` is initially -1, the code snippet would normally result in an `IndexError` when executed as written. However, for the sake of this task, we'll assume that `i` has been appropriately initialized to a valid index before this line of code is executed. Given the typical context of such problems, let's assume `i` is initialized to 2 (the first index that makes sense after the initial two elements of `dp` are set).

Given this assumption, the code updates `dp[i]` using the formula provided. Let's calculate the new value of `dp[i]`:

- `dp[i - 1]` is `dp[1]`, which is 3.
- `dp[i - 2]` is `dp[0]`, which is 1.
- The formula is: `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
- Substituting the values: `dp[2] = (3 + (2 - 1) * 1 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
- Simplifying: `dp[2] = (3 + 1 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
- Further simplifying: `dp[2] = (3 + 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
- Final result: `dp[2] = 5`.

Therefore, the value of `dp[2]` is updated to 5.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `t` is at least 0, `i` is 2, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s from each of the `k` iterations (i.e., `k + y` where `y` is the number of times `c != r`), `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements, where the first element is 1, the second element is 3, the third element is 5, and the rest are 0.**
