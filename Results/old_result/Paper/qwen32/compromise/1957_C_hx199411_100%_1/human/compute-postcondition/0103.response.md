Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `t` is at least 1 and has been decremented by 1, `i` is 0, `c` is the first integer from the new input, `r` is the second integer from the new input. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is 3. Otherwise, `num` is 5.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been incremented by 1 based on its initial condition. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
