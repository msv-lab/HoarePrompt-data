Let's analyze the provided code to see if it correctly determines whether the shape formed by the `1`s in the grid is a square or a triangle based on the given problem description.

### Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid (`n`).
   - Then, it reads `n` lines of `n` characters each representing the grid.

2. **Logic for Determining Shape:**
   - The code initializes `a` to `0` and `b` to an empty string.
   - For each line in the grid, it counts the number of `1`s.
     - If there is exactly one `1` in the line, it sets `a` to `'TRIANGLE'`.
     - If there is more than one `1` in the line, it sets `b` to `'SQUARE'`.
   - After processing all lines, it checks if `a` is not `0`. If so, it prints `a` (which would be `'TRIANGLE'`). Otherwise, it prints `b` (which would be `'SQUARE'`).

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Triangle Check:**
  - The code only sets `a` to `'TRIANGLE'` if any row has exactly one `1`. However, this is not sufficient to confirm that the shape is a triangle. A triangle can have multiple rows with different numbers of `1`s, and it may not necessarily have a row with exactly one `1`.

- **Square Check:**
  - The code sets `b` to `'SQUARE'` if any row has more than one `1`. This is also not sufficient to confirm that the shape is a square. A square requires all rows to have the same number of `1`s, and these `1`s must be aligned in such a way that they form a square.

### Conclusion:
The logic in the provided code does not correctly identify whether the shape is a triangle or a square. It makes incorrect assumptions about the conditions required for a triangle and a square.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
