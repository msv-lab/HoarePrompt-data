### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Square**: 
   - Consists of `k` consecutive rows (`k > 1`).
   - Each row has `k` consecutive '1's.
   - All '1's are aligned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

2. **Triangle**:
   - Consists of `k` consecutive rows (`k > 1`).
   - The `i-th` row has `2*i - 1` consecutive '1's.
   - The central '1's are located in one column.
   - An upside-down triangle is also considered valid.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the grid itself.
- It initializes `a` to `0` and `b` to an empty string.
- It iterates through each row of the grid:
  - If a row contains exactly one '1', it sets `a` to "TRIANGLE".
  - If a row contains more than one '1', it sets `b` to "SQUARE".
- After processing all rows, it checks the value of `a`:
  - If `a` is not `0`, it prints "TRIANGLE".
  - Otherwise, it prints "SQUARE".

#### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not correctly identify the shapes based on the given criteria.
- It only checks the count of '1's in each row without considering their positions or the overall structure of the shape.
- For example, a square might have rows with different numbers of '1's if they are not aligned properly, but the program would still consider it a square.
- Similarly, a triangle might have rows with more than one '1' but not necessarily in the pattern required for a triangle.

#### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly determine whether the '1's form a triangle or a square based on the problem's criteria. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
