### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its function summary against the problem description and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if the '1's in an `n x n` grid form a triangle or a square.
- A triangle has `k` rows with `2*i - 1` '1's in the `i-th` row, centered.
- A square has `k` rows with `k` '1's in each row, aligned to the left.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = 0
        b = ''
        for j in range(n):
            s = input()
            if s.count('1') == 1:
                a = 'TRIANGLE'
            elif s.count('1') > 1:
                b = 'SQUARE'
        if a != 0:
            print(a)
        else:
            print(b)
```

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Triangle Cases**:
   - The program checks if a row contains exactly one '1' to determine if the shape is a triangle. This is incorrect because a triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, especially in the middle rows.
   - Example:
     ```
     00100
     01110
     11111
     ```
     The second row has three '1's, and the third row has five '1's. The program would incorrectly identify this as a square.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Square Cases**:
   - The program checks if a row contains more than one '1' to determine if the shape is a square. This is insufficient because a triangle can also have multiple '1's in some rows.
   - Example:
     ```
     0001000
     0011100
     0111110
     1111111
     ```
     The program would incorrectly identify this as a square because it sees more than one '1' in the second and subsequent rows.

3. **No Proper Logic for Shape Detection**:
   - The program lacks logic to check for the specific patterns of '1's that define a triangle or a square.
   - It only checks the count of '1's in each row, which is not enough to determine the shape accurately.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle due to the reasons mentioned above.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
