To determine what will be printed by the `print(b)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state:

1. `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
2. `i` is set to 2.
3. `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 10.
4. `grid` is an `n x n` list of strings where each string consists of `n` characters, each character being either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.
5. `a` is initialized to 0.
6. `b` is set to 'SQUARE' if the grid contains a square, otherwise `b` is an empty string.
7. `j` is set to `n-1`.
8. `s` is the last input string.

The variable `b` is the key here. According to the precondition, `b` is assigned 'SQUARE' if the grid contains a square, otherwise it remains an empty string. Since the problem states that the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square, and since `b` is only set to 'SQUARE' if there is a square, we need to consider the possibility of a square existing in the grid.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, `b` will be 'SQUARE' if the grid indeed contains a square, and it will be an empty string if the grid contains a triangle instead. However, since the problem does not specify which shape the grid contains, we must consider both possibilities based on the given information.

However, since the problem states that `b` is set to 'SQUARE' if the grid contains a square, and no other conditions are mentioned for setting `b` to something else, we can infer that if the grid contains a square, `b` will be 'SQUARE'.

Therefore, the most precise description we can provide based on the given information is that `b` will be 'SQUARE' if the grid contains a square.

Output: **SQUARE (if the grid contains a square)**
