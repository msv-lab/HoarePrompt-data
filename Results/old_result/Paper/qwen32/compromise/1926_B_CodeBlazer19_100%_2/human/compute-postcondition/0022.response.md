The given code snippet simply assigns the string `'TRIANGLE'` to the variable `a`. This assignment does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is that `a` now holds the value `'TRIANGLE'`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive; `i` is 0; `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10; the grid is an n x n list of strings where each string consists of n characters, each character being either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1; `a` is 'TRIANGLE'; `b` is 'SQUARE' if the count of '1's in `s` is greater than 1, otherwise `b` is an empty string; `j` is 2; `s` is the new input string.**
