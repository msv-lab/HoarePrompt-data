The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 10. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 2.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive; `i` is 2; `n` is the new input integer between 2 and 10; the grid is a new `n x n` list of strings where each string consists of `n` characters, each character being either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1; `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0; `b` is 'SQUARE' if `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise `b` is ''; `j` is 2; `s` is the string input by the user. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'. If `s` contains more than one '1', `b` is set to 'SQUARE'.**
