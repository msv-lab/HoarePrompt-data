Given the initial state, let's break down the variables and their values:

- `t`: An input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
- `i`: Set to 0.
- `n`: An input integer between 2 and 10.
- `grid`: An n x n list of strings where each string consists of n characters, each character being either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.
- `a`: Set to the string 'TRIANGLE'.
- `b`: Set to the string 'SQUARE'.
- `j`: Set to n - 1.
- `s`: The last input string.

The `print` statement in question is:
```python
print(a)
```

From the initial state, we know that `a` is explicitly set to the string 'TRIANGLE'.

Therefore, the output of the `print(a)` statement will be:
Output: **TRIANGLE**
