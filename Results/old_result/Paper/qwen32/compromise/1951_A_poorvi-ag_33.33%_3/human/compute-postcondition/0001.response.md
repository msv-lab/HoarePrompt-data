The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. This action does not affect the values of `start`, `end`, or `t`. Therefore, the output state remains the same for `start`, `end`, and `t`, with the addition of the newly initialized `results` list.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is an input integer; `results` is an empty list.**
