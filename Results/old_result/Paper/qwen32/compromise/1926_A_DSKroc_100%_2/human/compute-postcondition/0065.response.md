The code snippet `bc += 1` increments the value of `bc` by 1. Given that `bc` is initially either 0, 1, or 2, after incrementing, `bc` will be either 1, 2, or 3 respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ac` is either 0, 1, or 2; `bc` is either 1, 2, or 3; `t` remains unchanged; `q` is `q + 1`; `s` is a non-empty string; `i` is the next character in `s`.**
