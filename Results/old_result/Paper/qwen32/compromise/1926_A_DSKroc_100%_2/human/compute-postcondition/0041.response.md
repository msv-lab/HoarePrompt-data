The code snippet increments the variable `bc` by 1. The values of `t`, `s`, `q`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32; `s` is a non-empty string; `q` is incremented by 1; `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the previously processed character; `bc` is incremented by 1.**
