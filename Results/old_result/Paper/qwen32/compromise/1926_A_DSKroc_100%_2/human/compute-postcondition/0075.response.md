Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` distinct strings of length 5 consisting solely of the characters 'A' and 'B'. For each string, it determines whether the number of 'A's is greater than the number of 'B's and prints 'A' if true, otherwise it prints 'B'. After processing all test cases, the output consists of `t` lines, each indicating the result ('A' or 'B') for the corresponding test case.**
