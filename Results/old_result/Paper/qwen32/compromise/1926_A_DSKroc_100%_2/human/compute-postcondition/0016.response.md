The code snippet `ac += 1` increments the variable `ac` by 1. The other variables `t`, `s`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32; `s` is a non-empty string; `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the previously processed character; `ac` is incremented by 1.**
