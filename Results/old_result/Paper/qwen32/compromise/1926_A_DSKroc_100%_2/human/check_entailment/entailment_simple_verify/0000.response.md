### Reasoning:
The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal. However, let's re-evaluate the problem description and the program carefully.

The problem description states: "Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B}?" This implies that we need to determine which letter appears more frequently in the string. If the counts are equal, the problem description does not specify a preference for which letter to output. Therefore, the behavior of the program in the case of a tie (equal counts) is not explicitly incorrect according to the problem statement.

The program currently outputs 'B' when the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal. While this might not be the most intuitive choice, it is still a valid solution as long as the problem does not specify a different behavior for ties.

Given that the problem does not specify what to do in the case of a tie, the current implementation is acceptable. The original assessment incorrectly assumes that the program must handle ties in a specific way, which is not required by the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
