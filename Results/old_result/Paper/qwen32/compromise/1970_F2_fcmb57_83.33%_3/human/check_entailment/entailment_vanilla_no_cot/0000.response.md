Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

There are several issues in the provided code that make it incorrect based on the problem description:

1. **Assignment vs Comparison:**
   - In the catch action (`elif mo[1] == 'C':`), the code mistakenly uses `==` instead of `=`. The correct line should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]`.

2. **Throwing the Quaffle:**
   - In the throw action (`elif mo[1] == 'T':`), the code incorrectly checks if the player is in a red or blue goal using `if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:` and `if players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:`. This will not work because `players[mo[0]]` is a tuple representing the player's position, and `goals['R']` and `goals['B']` are lists of tuples. The correct way to check if a position is in a list of positions is to use a loop or a set.
   - Additionally, when a player scores in their own goal, the Quaffle should be placed at the middle of the field, but the code places it at the player's position if the player's team matches the goal's team.

3. **Elimination Handling:**
   - The code correctly prints the elimination event and removes the player from the `players` dictionary, but it does not handle the case where the Quaffle is being carried by the eliminated player. The Quaffle should remain on the cell where the player and the Bludger were. The code currently does not handle this scenario correctly.

4. **Final Score:**
   - The final score is printed with the red team's score first, followed by the blue team's score. However, the problem description specifies that the output should be in the format `FINAL SCORE: r b`, where `r` is the score of the red team and `b` is the score of the blue team. The current code correctly prints the final score in this format, but the logic for determining the scores needs to be corrected due to the issues mentioned above.

### Corrected Code Snippets:

Here are the corrected snippets for the issues mentioned:

1. **Catch Action:**
   ```python
   elif mo[1] == 'C':
       quidditch[1] = mo[0]
   ```

2. **Throw Action:**
   ```python
   elif mo[1] == 'T':
       quidditch[1] = ''
       player_pos = players[mo[0]]
       if player_pos in goals['R']:
           if mo[0][0] == 'B':
               pointsb += 1
               print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
               quidditch[0] = middle
           else:
               pointsr += 1
               print(i, 'RED GOAL')
               quidditch[0] = middle
       elif player_pos in goals['B']:
           if mo[0][0] == 'R':
               pointsr += 1
               print(i, 'RED GOAL')
               quidditch[0] = middle
           else:
               pointsb += 1
               print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
               quidditch[0] = middle
   ```

3. **Elimination Handling:**
   ```python
   if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
       players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
       if '.B' in players:
           for k, v in players.items():
               if k != '.B' and v == players['.B']:
                   print(i, k, 'ELIMINATED')
                   if quidditch[1] == k:
                       quidditch[1] = ''
                   del players[k]
                   break
   ```

By fixing these issues, the code should correctly simulate the game and produce the correct output.
