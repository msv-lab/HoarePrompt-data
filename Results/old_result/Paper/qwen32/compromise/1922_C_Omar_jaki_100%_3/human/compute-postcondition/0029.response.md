To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the given information and analyze the expression step-by-step:

### Initial State Breakdown
1. **List `b` Structure**: 
   - The list `b` contains a specific pattern: `[0, 0, v1, v1, 2*v1, v1+v2, v1+v2, 2*v1+v2, ..., sum(v1, ..., vk), sum(v1, ..., vk), 2*sum(v1, ..., vk)]`.
   - This means that for every pair of elements starting from the third element, the first element is a cumulative sum up to a certain point, and the second element is the same cumulative sum.
   - For example, if `v1 = 1` and `v2 = 2`, the list might look like `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6]`.

2. **Variables `c` and `d`**:
   - These are values returned by the function `r()`. No specific details about the function `r()` are provided, so we'll denote `c` and `d` as arbitrary integers.
   - The conditions `if c < d` and `if c >= d` do not alter `c` or `d`, meaning their values remain unchanged after these checks.

3. **Expression Analysis**:
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]`.
   - This expression calculates the difference between two elements in the list `b`. Specifically, it subtracts the element at index `(c - 1) * 2` from the element at index `(d - 1) * 2`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation
1. **Indices Calculation**:
   - The index for `b[(d - 1) * 2]` is `(d - 1) * 2`.
   - The index for `b[(c - 1) * 2]` is `(c - 1) * 2`.

2. **Element Values**:
   - Since the list `b` has pairs of identical elements starting from the third element, the value at index `(d - 1) * 2` will be the same as the value at index `(d - 1) * 2 + 1`.
   - Similarly, the value at index `(c - 1) * 2` will be the same as the value at index `(c - 1) * 2 + 1`.

3. **Difference Calculation**:
   - The difference `b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]` will be the difference between the cumulative sums at indices `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2`.

### Final Output
Given the structure of the list `b` and the indices calculated, the output will be the difference between the cumulative sums at the specified positions.

Output: **difference between the cumulative sums at indices `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2` in the list `b`**.
