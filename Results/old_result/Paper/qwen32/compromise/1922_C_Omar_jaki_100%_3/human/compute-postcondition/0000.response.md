The given code snippet defines a lambda function `r` that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer. This function is typically used to read multiple space-separated integers from a single line of input.

Given the initial state, the only change introduced by the code is the creation of the lambda function `r`. No other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, or the queries) are modified or assigned new values in this snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and for each of the `m` queries, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ n and x ≠ y; `r` is a lambda function that maps space-separated integers from input to a tuple of integers.**
