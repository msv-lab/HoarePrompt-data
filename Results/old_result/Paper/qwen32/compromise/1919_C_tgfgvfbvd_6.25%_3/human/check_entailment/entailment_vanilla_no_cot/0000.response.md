Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array into two subsequences as described in the problem statement. The logic used in the program does not accurately reflect the optimal strategy for minimizing the penalties `p(s)` and `p(t)`.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Initialization and Logic**: The program initializes `a` with the first element of the list and `b` with `0`. It then tries to find the first element greater than the first element to initialize `b`, but this approach does not ensure that `a` and `b` are the best starting points for minimizing penalties.

2. **Updating `a` and `b`**: The program updates `a` and `b` based on certain conditions, but these conditions do not guarantee that the penalties `p(s)` and `p(t)` are minimized. The program does not consider all possible ways to split the array into two subsequences.

3. **Counting Penalty**: The variable `c` is incremented when a condition is met, but it does not correctly represent the total penalty `p(s) + p(t)` for any split of the array.

A correct approach would involve considering different ways to split the array and calculating the penalties for each split, then choosing the split with the minimum total penalty. This could be done using dynamic programming or other optimization techniques, but the current program does not implement such a strategy.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
