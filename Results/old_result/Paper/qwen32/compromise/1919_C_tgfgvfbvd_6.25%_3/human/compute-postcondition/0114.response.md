Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `c` is `0`, and `y` is less than `n-1`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `(a - l[x] <= b - l[x])` holds true; otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` remains `l[x]` if `a` is equal to `l[x]`; otherwise, `a` is updated to `l[0]` and `b` is updated to `l[x]`. Additionally, either `l[x]` is not greater than `a` or `l[x]` is not greater than `b`.**
