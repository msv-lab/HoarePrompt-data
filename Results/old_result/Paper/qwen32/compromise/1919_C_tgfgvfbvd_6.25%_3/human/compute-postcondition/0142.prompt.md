Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is `l[0]`, `b` is `l[y]` where `y` is the first index such that `l[y] > l[y-1]` or `0` if no such index exists, `c` is `0`, and `y` is `n-1` if the loop did not break early or the value of `y` at which the loop broke.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
        if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
        c += 1
    elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
        if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    elif a >= l[x]:
        a = l[x]
    else:
        b = l[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, and `y` is less than `n-1`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is set to `1`, `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, otherwise `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is set to `0`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `(a - l[x] <= b - l[x])` holds true; otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` remains `l[x]` if `a` is equal to `l[x]`; otherwise, `a` is updated to `l[0]` and `b` is updated to `l[x]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is less than `n-1`, `x` is `y + 2`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is incremented by 1, and if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, `a` is set to `l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then if `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` remains unchanged if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`; otherwise, `a` is set to `l[x]`. Similarly, `b` remains unchanged if `b` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is set to `l[x]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is less than `n-1`, `x` is `y + 3`, `a` and `b` are updated based on the comparison with `l[x]`, and `c` is incremented by 1 if `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, `c` remains unchanged. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, `a` is set to `l[x]` if `a < l[x]`; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged, and `b` is set to `l[x]` if `a < l[x]`; otherwise, `b` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
