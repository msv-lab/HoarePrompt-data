Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first element of the list `l` unless `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b` and `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, in which case `a` is updated to `l[x]`. `b` is the first element `l[y]` where `l[y] > l[y-1]` or 0 if no such element exists, unless `l[x] < b` and either `a - l[x] > b - l[x]` or `l[x] >= a`, in which case `b` is updated to `l[x]`. `c` is 0, and `y` is 0.**
