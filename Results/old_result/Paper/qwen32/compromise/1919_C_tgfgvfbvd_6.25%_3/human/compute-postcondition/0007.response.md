To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for y in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variables involved in the loop head are `y` and `n`.

1. **Variable `n`:** The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because `range(1, n)` generates numbers starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute.

2. **Variable `y`:** The variable `y` is the loop variable and is initialized to 1 in the first iteration of the loop. Before the loop starts, `y` is set to 0 as per the given state. However, since `y` is reassigned in the loop header, its initial value before the loop does not affect the loop's execution. Therefore, we don't need to adjust `y` before the loop starts.

Given these observations, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `b` is 0, `c` is 0, `y` is 0**
