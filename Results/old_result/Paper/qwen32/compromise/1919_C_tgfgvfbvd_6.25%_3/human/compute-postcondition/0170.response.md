The value of `b` is updated to `l[x]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is `l[0]`, `b` is `l[x]`, `c` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `l` is the list of integers read from input, `y` is an index such that `y < n - 1`. The current value of `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, and `l[x] - a < l[x] - b`.**
