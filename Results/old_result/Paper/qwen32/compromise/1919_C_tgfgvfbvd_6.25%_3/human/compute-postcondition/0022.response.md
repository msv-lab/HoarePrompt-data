Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `b` is the first element `l[y]` where `l[y] > l[y-1]` or 0 if no such element exists, `c` is 0, `y` is 0, and `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`.**
