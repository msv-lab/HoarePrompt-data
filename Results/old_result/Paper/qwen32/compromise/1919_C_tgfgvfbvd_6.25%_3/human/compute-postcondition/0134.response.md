Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is less than `n-1`, `x` is `y + 3`, `a` is `l[x]`, `b` is unchanged, `c` is unchanged**

Natural Language: The value of `a` is updated to be the element at index `x` in the list `l`. All other variables retain their initial values.
