Output State: **`a` is either `l[0]` or `l[x+1]` if `l[x+1] > a and l[x+1] > b`, otherwise `a` is either `l[0]` or `l[x]`. `b` is `l[x]`. `c` is 2 if `l[x] > a and l[x] > b`, otherwise `c` is 1 if `l[x+1]` is greater than both `a` and `b`; otherwise, `c` is 0. `n` is the input integer, `l` is the list of integers read from input, `y` is an index such that `y < n - 1`, and `x` is `x + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `b` is now set to `l[x]`. The values of `a` and `c` may change based on the new value of `b` and the conditions provided. All other variables remain unchanged.
