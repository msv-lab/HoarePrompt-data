The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `l`. This operation changes the value of `l` but does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, or `y`.

Output State: **`a` is the smallest value in `l[y+1:n]` or the initial `a`, `b` is the second smallest value in `l[y+1:n]` or the initial `b`, `c` is the count of elements in `l[y+1:n]` that were greater than both `a` and `b`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is now a list of integers read from input, `y` is unchanged.**
