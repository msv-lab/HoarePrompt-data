To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the variables evolve through each iteration of the outer loop. Let's break down the process step-by-step:

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Outer Loop (`for _ in range(int(input()))`)**:
   - This loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, the following steps are executed.

2. **Inner Loop (`for y in range(1, n)`)**:
   - This loop finds the first index `y` where `l[y] > l[y-1]`.
   - If no such `y` is found, `y` remains `n-1` (since the loop doesn't break).

3. **Second Inner Loop (`for x in range(y + 1, n)`)**:
   - This loop iterates from `y+1` to `n-1` and updates `a`, `b`, and `c` based on the conditions provided:
     - If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, it checks whether `l[x] - a` or `l[x] - b` is larger to update `a` or `b` accordingly and increments `c`.
     - If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, it checks whether `a - l[x]` or `b - l[x]` is smaller to update `a` or `b` accordingly.
     - If `a >= l[x]`, it sets `a` to `l[x]`.
     - Otherwise, it sets `b` to `l[x]`.

4. **Final Output (`print(c)`)**:
   - After the second inner loop completes, the value of `c` is printed, which represents the count of elements in the sublist `l[y+1:n]` that were greater than both `a` and `b` at some point during the loop.

### Final Output State:
After all `t` test cases have been processed, the final output state will be a series of integers, each corresponding to the value of `c` for each test case. The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `y` will be reset at the start of each test case, so their final values after all iterations will depend on the specific test case being processed.

### Conclusion:
The final output state after all iterations of the loop will be a sequence of integers, each representing the count `c` for each test case. Since the problem statement asks for the output state in a specific format, we can summarize it as follows:

Output State: **A series of integers, each representing the count `c` for each test case.**

In natural language, this means that after processing all test cases, the program will output a list of integers where each integer corresponds to the count of elements in the respective sublist `l[y+1:n]` that were greater than both `a` and `b` at some point during the loop for each test case.
