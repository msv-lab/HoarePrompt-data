Output State: **`a` is `l[x]`, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its predecessor or 0 if no such element exists, `c` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `l` is the list of integers read from input, `y` is an index such that `y < n - 1`. Additionally, `a >= l[x]` and either `l[x]` is not less than `a` or `l[x]` is not less than `b`.**

Explanation: The value of `a` is updated to `l[x]`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition `a >= l[x]` is inherently satisfied since `a` is now equal to `l[x]`. The other conditions involving `b` and `c` remain as they were.
