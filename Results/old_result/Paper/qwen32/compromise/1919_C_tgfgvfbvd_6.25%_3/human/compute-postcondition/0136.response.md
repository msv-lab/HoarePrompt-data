Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is less than `n-1`, `x` is `y + 3`, `a` is either `l[x]` or unchanged, `b` is either `l[y + 3]` or unchanged, `c` is unchanged. Specifically, if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, then `a` is set to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is set to `l[y + 3]`.**
