To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement:

- `a` is the smallest element in the sublist `l[y+1:n]`.
- `b` is the largest element in the sublist `l[y+1:n]` that satisfies the given conditions (though the specific conditions are not detailed here, it's implied that there are some constraints on `b`).
- `c` is the count of elements in the sublist `l[y+1:n]` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

Given this, the print statement `print(c)` will output the value of `c`.

However, since the exact values of `l`, `y`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `c`. But based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the count of elements in the sublist `l[y+1:n]` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

Output: **c (where c is the count of elements in l[y+1:n] that are greater than both a and b)**
