Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is 0, `y` is 0, and the current value of `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`. If `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`.**
