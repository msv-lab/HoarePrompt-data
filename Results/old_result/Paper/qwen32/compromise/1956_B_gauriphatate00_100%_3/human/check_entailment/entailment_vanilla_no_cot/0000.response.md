Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally. The program simply counts the number of pairs in your hand and returns that count, which does not account for Nene's optimal play strategy.

Nene's optimal strategy involves maximizing her score and minimizing yours. This means she will try to avoid giving you points whenever possible. The program does not simulate the turns or take into account the dynamic nature of the game where the state of the table changes with each move.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to simulate the game, taking into account the optimal moves for both players, which is a more complex task than just counting pairs.
