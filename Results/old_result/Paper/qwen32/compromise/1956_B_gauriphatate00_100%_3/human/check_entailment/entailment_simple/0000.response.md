### Reasoning:

The provided program calculates the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally under the given conditions. Here's a detailed explanation of the program and the logic:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.

2. **Counting Card Occurrences:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `count_a` to count the occurrences of each card in your hand.

3. **Calculating Maximum Score:**
   - The program then iterates through each possible card number from `1` to `n`.
   - For each card number, it checks if it appears exactly twice in your hand (`count_a[num] == 2`).
   - If a card number appears exactly twice, it increments the `max_score` by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the `max_score` for each test case, which represents the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally.

### Analysis:

The logic of the program is based on the observation that you can score a point only if you place a card on the table that has already been placed there by either you or Nene. Since Nene plays optimally and aims to both maximize her score and minimize yours, the best strategy for you is to maximize the number of pairs of cards you have in your hand. 

If a card appears exactly twice in your hand, you can guarantee that you will get one point for that card (since Nene will not be able to place it before you do the second time). Therefore, the number of cards that appear exactly twice in your hand (`max_score`) is the maximum number of points you can score.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
