Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the conditions specified in the problem. Specifically:

1. The program does not ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type appear consecutively for any permutation of the scenarios.
2. The logic for deciding whether to assign 'F' or 'S' to the '?' characters is flawed. It incorrectly tries to balance the number of 'F' and 'S' based on the initial counts, but this does not guarantee the required condition for all permutations.
3. The program does not account for the constraints properly, especially the requirement to ensure the condition holds for all possible scenario permutations.

Here is a brief explanation of the issues in the program:

- The program categorizes scenarios into two lists, `sa` and `sb`, based on whether they have been assigned 'F' or 'S' initially. However, it does not ensure that the remaining '?' characters are filled in a way that satisfies the condition for all permutations.
- The program assigns 'F' or 'S' to '?' based on the initial counts of 'F' and 'S', but this does not guarantee that the condition for consecutive videos is met.
- The program does not use any backtracking or other methods to ensure that the condition is met for all possible permutations of the scenarios.

To solve the problem correctly, a more sophisticated approach is needed, possibly involving backtracking or dynamic programming to ensure that the condition is met for all permutations.
