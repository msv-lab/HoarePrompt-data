Let's go through the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem. We'll analyze the logic, the handling of the constraints, and the output.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program starts by reading the integer `n` which represents the number of scenarios.
   - It then reads `n` lines, each containing `n` characters representing the transition videos between scenarios. Characters can be 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (no transition to self).

2. **Counting Existing Funny and Scary Videos:**
   - It initializes two arrays `a` and `b` to count the number of funny and scary videos for each scenario.
   - It iterates through the input matrix and updates these counts based on whether the transition video is 'F' or 'S'.

3. **Identifying Scenarios with Only Funny or Only Scary Videos:**
   - It creates two lists `sa` and `sb` to store scenarios that have only funny or only scary videos, respectively.

4. **Deciding the Majority Type:**
   - It compares the lengths of `sa` and `sb` to decide the majority type of videos to assign to undecided transitions.
   - If there are more scenarios with only funny videos (`sa`), it assigns 'F' to most undecided transitions. Otherwise, it assigns 'S'.

5. **Assigning Remaining Videos:**
   - It fills in the remaining undecided transitions with the majority type, with some logic involving `n // 4 - 1`, which seems to be an attempt to distribute types evenly.
   - It prints the final matrix with all transitions decided.

### Issues and Flaws in the Program:

1. **Handling Undecided Transitions:**
   - The logic for deciding the majority type is flawed. It only considers scenarios with only funny or only scary videos, which is not a sufficient condition to determine the overall majority type across all transitions.
   - The assignment of 'F' or 'S' to undecided transitions is not guaranteed to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type appear in any permutation of scenarios.

2. **Logic for Consecutive Videos:**
   - The program does not check the constraints on consecutive videos after assigning types to undecided transitions. It simply assigns types based on the majority type of already decided videos, which does not guarantee the required constraint.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the number of scenarios `n` is small (e.g., `n = 2` or `n = 3`), where the constraints might be more restrictive.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not ensure that the constraint on consecutive videos of the same type is met for all permutations of scenarios. It only assigns types based on the majority type of already decided videos, which is not sufficient to guarantee the required constraint.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
