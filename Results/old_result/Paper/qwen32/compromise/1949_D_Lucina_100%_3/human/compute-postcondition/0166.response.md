The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `i` is equal to `n`. Since the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`, the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`nx` is a string, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 2**
