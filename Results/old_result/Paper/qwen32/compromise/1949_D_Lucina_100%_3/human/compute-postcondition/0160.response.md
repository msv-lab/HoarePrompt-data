The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, and `j` has reached its maximum value of `n` (assuming the loop has just finished executing for `j = n`).

To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to the next value in the range, which would be `j = 1` if we are starting the loop, but since we are transitioning from the end of the previous iteration where `j` was `n`, the loop would naturally terminate as `j` is out of the range.

However, if we are considering the state right before the loop starts again (assuming some reset or reinitialization), `j` should be set to 1.

State: **`nx` is a string, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 1**
