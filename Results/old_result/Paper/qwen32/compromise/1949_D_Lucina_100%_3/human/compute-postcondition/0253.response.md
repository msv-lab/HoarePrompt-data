The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the existing value of `nx`. 

Given the initial state, `nx` can either be the first character of `xx[1]` (if the character at position `j - 1` of `xx[1]` is not '?') or 'S' or 'F' (if the character at position `j - 1` of `xx[1]` is '?'). In any case, after the operation `nx += 'S'`, `nx` will have 'S' appended to it.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all `n` input strings, `i` is 1, `sa` is a list of indices where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list of indices where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. If `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0` for any `i` from 1 to `n`, then those indices are appended to `sb`. The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, `j` is 2, `nx` is either the first character of `xx[1]` followed by 'S', or 'SS', or 'FS'.**
