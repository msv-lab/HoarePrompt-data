To determine what is printed by the `print(nx)` statement, let's break down the given information and the steps involved in constructing the string `nx`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`n`**: An integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\).
2. **`a`**: A list of length \(n + 1\).
3. **`b`**: A list of length \(n + 1\).
4. **`xx`**: A list containing an empty string and all \(n\) input strings. Therefore, `xx` has \(n + 1\) elements.
5. **`i`**: Initialized to 1.
6. **`sa`**: A list of indices where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`.
7. **`sb`**: A list of indices where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. If both `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, those indices are also appended to `sb`.
8. **`j`**: Initialized to \(n + 1\).
9. **`nx`**: A string constructed based on specific rules for each `j` from 1 to \(n\).

### Construction of `nx`:
The string `nx` is constructed by appending characters from `xx[1]` or 'S'/'F' based on the rules described for each `j` from 1 to \(n\). However, the specific rules for constructing `nx` are not explicitly provided in the initial state description. Given the information, we can only describe the construction process in a generic manner.

### What is Printed:
Since the specific rules for constructing `nx` are not provided, we can describe `nx` in terms of its construction process and the inputs it depends on.

- `nx` starts as an empty string.
- For each `j` from 1 to \(n\), characters are appended to `nx` based on the values of `a[j]`, `b[j]`, and the contents of `xx[j]`.
- If `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, `nx` might append a character from `xx[j]` or 'S'.
- If `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, `nx` might append a character from `xx[j]` or 'F'.
- If both `a[j] == 0` and `b[j] == 0`, `nx` might append a character from `xx[j]` or 'F' (or another character based on the rules).

Given the lack of specific rules, the most precise description we can provide is that `nx` is a string constructed based on the values in `a`, `b`, and `xx` following the described rules.

### Final Output:
Output: **nx (where nx is a string constructed based on the values in `a`, `b`, and `xx` following the described rules)**
