The provided code snippet `b[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of the list `b` by 1. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the list `b` or the index `i`. Therefore, we can only update the state of `b[i]` to reflect the increment.

Output State: **`x` is a list, `j` is an index such that `j - 1` is a valid index in `x`, the element at index `j - 1` in `x` is 'S', and the element at index `j - 1` in `x` is not 'F'; `b[i]` is incremented by 1.**
