Postcondition: **`nx` is a string with an additional character appended to it. If `xx[i][1]` is not equal to '?', the appended character is `xx[i][1]`. Otherwise, the appended character is either 'F' or 'S', depending on whether `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`. `xx` remains a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the corresponding character in `xx[n]`. `sa` remains a list, `i` is an integer, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 2.**
