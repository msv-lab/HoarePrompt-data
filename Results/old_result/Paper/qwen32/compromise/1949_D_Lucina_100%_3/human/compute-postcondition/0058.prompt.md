Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[1]` is the total number of 'F' characters in `x` and `a[j]` is the cumulative number of 'F' characters up to position `j` in `x`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[1]` is the total number of 'S' characters in `x` and `b[j]` is the cumulative number of 'S' characters up to position `j` in `x`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and the input string `x`, `i` is 2, and `x` is the new input string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if x[j - 1] == 'F':
        a[i] += 1
        a[j] += 1
    elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
        b[i] += 1
        b[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[1]` is the total number of 'F' characters in `x` and `a[2]` is the cumulative number of 'F' characters up to position 2 in `x` increased by 1 if `x[j - 1]` is 'F', `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[1]` is the total number of 'S' characters in `x` and `b[2]` is the cumulative number of 'S' characters up to position 2 in `x` increased by 1 if `x[j - 1]` is 'S', `xx` is a list containing an empty string and the input string `x`, `i` is 2, and `x` is the new input string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[1]` is the total number of 'F' characters in `x` and `a[2]` is the cumulative number of 'F' characters up to position 2 in `x` increased by 2 if `x[j - 1]` is 'F', `a[3]` is the cumulative number of 'F' characters up to position 3 in `x` increased by 1 if `x[j - 1]` is 'F', `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[1]` is the total number of 'S' characters in `x` and `b[2]` is the cumulative number of 'S' characters up to position 2 in `x` increased by 1 if `x[j - 1]` is 'S', `b[3]` is incremented by 1 if `x[j - 1]` is 'S', `xx` is a list containing an empty string and the input string `x`, `i` is 2, `x` is the new input string, `j` is 3. If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', `a[2]` is incremented by 2 and `a[3]` by 1. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', `b[2]` and `b[3]` are incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[1]` is the total number of 'F' characters in `x`. If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', then `a[2]` is incremented by 3 and `a[3]` by 2, and `a[4]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `a[2]` and `a[3]` remain the cumulative number of 'F' characters up to positions 2 and 3 in `x`, respectively. `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[1]` is the total number of 'S' characters in `x`. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[2]` and `b[3]` are incremented by 1. Otherwise, `b[2]` and `b[3]` remain the cumulative number of 'S' characters up to positions 2 and 3 in `x`, respectively. `xx` is a list containing an empty string and the input string `x`. `i` is 2. `x` is the new input string. `j` is 4.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
