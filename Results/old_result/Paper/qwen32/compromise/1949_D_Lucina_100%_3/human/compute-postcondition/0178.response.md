The code appends the character `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. Given that `nx` was initially an empty string, after the operation, `nx` will contain the character `xx[i][j - 1]`. The other variables (`sa`, `i`, `n`, and the condition `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?') remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is a string containing the character `xx[i][j - 1]`, `xx` is a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the corresponding character in `xx[n]`, `sa` is a list, `i` is an integer, `n` is greater than 0, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'**.
