Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all `n` input strings, `i` is `n+1`, `sa` is a list of indices where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list of indices where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. If `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0` for any `i` from 1 to `n`, then those indices are appended to `sb`. The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, `j` is `k + 1`. If `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, `nx` is a string with 'S' appended to its previous value. Otherwise, `nx` is 'F'.**
