Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the cumulative sum of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for each `cnt >= 3` and `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for each `cnt >= 2` where `total_sum` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens` except the current `cnt` for each test case. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `n` and `nums` are reinitialized for each test case.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the output state is the total sum of all valid combinations for each test case, where `res` is calculated based on the frequency of each number in the list `nums`. The variable `t` (the number of test cases) remains the same, and for each test case, `n` (the number of integers in the list) and `nums` (the list of integers) are reset and processed independently.
