The only object in the loop head is `cnt`, which iterates over the values of the `num_of_lens` dictionary. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `cnt` to the next value in the dictionary.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an input integer
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least one integer
- `res` is calculated based on the value of `cnt` from the `num_of_lens` dictionary

Let's assume that in the previous iteration, `cnt` had a certain value, say `cnt_prev`. At the start of the next iteration, `cnt` should be the next value in the `num_of_lens` dictionary.

Since we do not have the specific values of `num_of_lens`, we can only describe the state in a general form. Let's denote the next value in the `num_of_lens` dictionary as `cnt_next`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least one integer, `cnt` is `cnt_next`, where `cnt_next` is the next value in the `num_of_lens` dictionary**
