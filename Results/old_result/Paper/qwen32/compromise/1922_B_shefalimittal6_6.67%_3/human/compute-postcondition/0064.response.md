The code snippet updates the value of `total_sum` by recalculating it as the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the current `cnt` value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is the initial value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, and an additional `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3; `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers from the input; `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the current `cnt` value.**
