Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least one integer, `cnt` is `cnt_next`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is further increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens` excluding those equal to `cnt`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.**
