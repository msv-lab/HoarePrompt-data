The only variable in the loop head is `x`, which is the loop variable that iterates over the elements in the list `nums`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state and how the loop progresses.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements.
- `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1, where `x` is the next element in the list `nums` to be processed.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` would have taken the value of the current element in `nums` and `num_of_lens[x]` would have been incremented. For the next iteration, `x` will take the value of the next element in `nums`.

Let's assume that in the previous iteration, `x` was equal to `nums[0]`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `x` should be equal to `nums[1]`.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 elements; `x` is `nums[1]`; `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1, where `x` is the next element in the list `nums` to be processed.** 

However, since we are only concerned with the state at the start of the next iteration, we do not need to mention the increment operation in the state description. Thus, the final state is:

State: **`nums` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 elements; `x` is `nums[1]`.**
