The code snippet `res += math.comb(cnt, 3)` increments the variable `res` by the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Assuming `cnt` is a specific value, the output state will reflect this change. The variables `nums`, `num_of_lens`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged. The value of `res` will be updated to its original value plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `nums` and each value is the count of that element in `nums`, `t` remains in its initial state, `n` remains in its initial state, `res` is the original value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`**.
