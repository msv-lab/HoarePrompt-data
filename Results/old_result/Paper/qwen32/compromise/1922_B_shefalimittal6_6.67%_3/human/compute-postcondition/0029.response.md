Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least one integer, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.**
