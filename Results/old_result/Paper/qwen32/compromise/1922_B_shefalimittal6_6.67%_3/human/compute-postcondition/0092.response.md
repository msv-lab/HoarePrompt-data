The code snippet calculates the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value stored in `cnt`. This sum is then assigned to the variable `total_sum`. The other variables (`nums`, `num_of_lens`, `t`, `n`, `res`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `nums` and each value is the count of that element in `nums`, `t` remains in its initial state, `n` remains in its initial state, `res` is the original value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is at least 3, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for `cnt`.**
