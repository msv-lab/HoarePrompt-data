The code snippet modifies the value of `res` by adding to it the product of `math.comb(cnt, 2)` and `total_sum`. The other variables remain unchanged as per the given initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least one integer, `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, then `res` is set to `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Otherwise, `res` remains 0. `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that is equal to `cnt`. `res` is now `res + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.**
