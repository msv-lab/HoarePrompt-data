The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `res`. The other variables `nums`, `num_of_lens`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers read from the input; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `nums` and each value is the count of that element in `nums`; `res` is 0; `t` remains in its initial state; `n` remains in its initial state.**
