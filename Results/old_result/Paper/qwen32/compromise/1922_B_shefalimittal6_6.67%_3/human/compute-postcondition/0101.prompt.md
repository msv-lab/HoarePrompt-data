Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nums` is a list of integers read from the input; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `nums` and each value is the count of that element in `nums`; `res` is 0; `t` remains in its initial state; `n` remains in its initial state.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
    if cnt >= 2:
        total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
        res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nums` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `nums` and each value is the count of that element in `nums`, `t` remains in its initial state, `n` remains in its initial state. If `cnt` is an integer with a value of at least 2, `res` is the original value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` that are not equal to `cnt`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. If `cnt` is at least 3, `res` is also increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)` as per the initial condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `nums` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `nums` and each value is the count of that element in `nums`, `t` remains in its initial state, `n` remains in its initial state, `res` is updated by adding `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is at least 2, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `nums` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `nums` and each value is the count of that element in `nums`, `t` remains in its initial state, `n` remains in its initial state. If `cnt` is at least 2, `res` is updated to `res + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the new `cnt`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
