The only object in the loop head is the variable `cnt`, which iterates over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`. To ensure the loop can execute, `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair. The values of `res`, `t`, `n`, and `nums` do not directly affect the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`res` is 0, `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers from the input**
