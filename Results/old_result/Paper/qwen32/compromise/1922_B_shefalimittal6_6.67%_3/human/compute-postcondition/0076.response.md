The code snippet increments the count of the next element `x` in the list `nums` within the dictionary `num_of_lens`. Given the initial state, the value of `num_of_lens[x]` will be updated based on its current value (or 0 if it doesn't exist yet).

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 elements; `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1, where `x` is the next element in the list `nums` to be processed.**

Natural language description: The list `nums` remains unchanged. The dictionary `num_of_lens` has its value for the key `x` (the next element in `nums`) incremented by 1. All other variables and their values are unchanged.
