Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 elements; `x` is `nums[1]`; `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language: The list `nums` remains unchanged, and `x` still holds the value of the second element of `nums`. The value associated with the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` is incremented by 1. If `x` was not already a key in `num_of_lens`, it is now added with a value of 1.
