Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least one integer. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, then `res` is set to `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.**
