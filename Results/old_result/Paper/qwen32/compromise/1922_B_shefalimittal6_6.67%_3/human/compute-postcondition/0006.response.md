The code snippet increments the count of `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. If `x` is not already a key in the dictionary, it initializes the count to 1. If `x` is already a key, it increments the count by 1.

Given the initial state, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, and `x` is an integer from the list `nums`. After executing the code, `num_of_lens` will have `x` as a key with its count updated accordingly.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value incremented by 1; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one integer.**
