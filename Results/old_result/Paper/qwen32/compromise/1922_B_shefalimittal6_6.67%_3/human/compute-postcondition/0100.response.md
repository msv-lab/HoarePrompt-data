Postcondition: **`nums` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `nums` and each value is the count of that element in `nums`, `t` remains in its initial state, `n` remains in its initial state. If `cnt` is at least 2, `res` is updated to `res + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the new `cnt`.**
