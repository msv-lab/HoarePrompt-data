The code snippet initializes an empty list called `pos`. This operation does not affect the values of `removals`, `negatives`, or `elements`. Therefore, the values of `removals` and `negatives` remain non-negative integers, and `elements` remains a list of integers. The precondition that either `removals` is not equal to 6 or `negatives` is not equal to 3 still holds.

Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is an empty list, and either `removals` is not equal to 6 or `negatives` is not equal to 3.**
