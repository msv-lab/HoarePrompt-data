Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `s1` is an input string; `s2` is the next input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2` or `a1 - a2 - 1` if the condition `s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'` is true; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`, which is equal to `hd` before it is potentially decreased. At the current index `i`, `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'**
