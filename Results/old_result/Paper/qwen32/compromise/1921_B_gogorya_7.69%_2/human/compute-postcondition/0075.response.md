Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 1, `s1` is the newly input string, `s2` is the next input string, `a1` is the count of '1's in the newly input `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in the newly input `s2`. At the current index `i`, `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'. `hd` (which is `a1 - a2`) is greater than 0, then `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 1`, otherwise `hd` remains `a1 - a2`. `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 1` and `_` is `n + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `res` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
