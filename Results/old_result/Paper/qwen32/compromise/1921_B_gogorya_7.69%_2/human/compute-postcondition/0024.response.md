Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 5; `s1` is an input string; `s2` is the next input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `i` is 5. If `hd` was greater than 0, then `hd` is now `hd - 1`. If `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'`, `res` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `hd` has been decremented by 1 if it was greater than 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `s1`, `s2`, `a1`, `a2`, `i`, and `res`) remain unchanged.
