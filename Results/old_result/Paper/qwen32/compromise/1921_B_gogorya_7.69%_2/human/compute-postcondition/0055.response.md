The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of the variables directly; it only controls the flow of the loop. Since the provided code snippet includes `continue` without any loop structure, it is effectively a no-op in this context, and the variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `hd` are described in terms of their conditions or changes. Since `continue` does not change these values, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `hd` is decreased by 1.**
