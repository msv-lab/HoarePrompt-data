The code snippet `n = int(input())` reassigns the value of `n` to the integer value of the new input provided. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the newly input integer; `s1` is the new input string; `s2` is the next input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is 0; `res` is abs(a1 - a2) + count_10; `_` is `n + 1`**.
