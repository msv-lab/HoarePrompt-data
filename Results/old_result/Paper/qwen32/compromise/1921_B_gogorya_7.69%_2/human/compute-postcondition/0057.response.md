Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `i + 2`; if `hd` is greater than 0, `hd` is decreased by 1; `res` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 (as per the initial state description) and then incremented by another 1 due to the current code, making it `i + 2`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the condition for `hd` remain unchanged as per the provided initial state.
