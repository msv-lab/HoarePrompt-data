The `continue` statement in the provided code snippet does not affect any variable values or conditions directly. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, none of the variable values or conditions change as a result of this statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 5; `s1` is an input string; `s2` is the next input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `i` is 5. If `hd` was greater than 0, then `hd` is now `hd - 1`. If `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'`, `res` is incremented by 1.**
