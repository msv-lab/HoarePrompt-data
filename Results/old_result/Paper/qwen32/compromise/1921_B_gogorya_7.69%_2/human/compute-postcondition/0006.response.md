The code snippet `a2 = s2.count('1')` counts the number of '1's in the string `s2` and assigns this count to the variable `a2`. The other variables, `t`, `n`, `s1`, and `a1`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s1` is an input string; `s2` is the next input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`.**
