### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum number of contiguous pieces a binary string needs to be cut into, such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

The approach taken by the provided code is as follows:
1. Initialize `count` to 1, assuming at least one piece is always needed.
2. Traverse the string and increment `count` whenever a transition from '0' to '1' or '1' to '0' is found. This is because each transition indicates a potential point where the string needs to be cut to ensure that '0's and '1's can be rearranged correctly.
3. Use a flag to check if there is at least one '0' followed by a '1'. If such a transition exists, decrement `count` by 1. This adjustment accounts for the fact that if the string starts with '0's and ends with '1's, the initial assumption of needing one piece (`count = 1`) is correct, and no additional piece is needed beyond the transitions counted.

Let's analyze the example cases provided in the problem statement:
- For "11010", the transitions are at positions 1->2 ('1' to '0') and 3->4 ('1' to '0'). Thus, `count` becomes 3. Since there is a '0' followed by a '1', the final `count` remains 3.
- For "00000000", there are no transitions, so `count` remains 1.
- For "1", there are no transitions, so `count` remains 1.
- For "10", there is one transition, so `count` becomes 2. Since there is a '0' following a '1', the final `count` remains 2.
- For "0001111", there is one transition, so `count` becomes 2. However, since there is no '0' following a '1', the final `count` is adjusted to 1.
- For "0110", there are two transitions, so `count` becomes 3. Since there is a '0' following a '1', the final `count` is adjusted to 2.

The logic in the code correctly handles these cases, ensuring that the minimum number of pieces required is calculated accurately.
