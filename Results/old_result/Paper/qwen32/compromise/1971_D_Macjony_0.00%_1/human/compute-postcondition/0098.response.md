Postcondition: **`t` is the same input integer, `s` is the same input string, `count` is the number of transitions between different characters in `s` minus 1 if `flag` is True, otherwise `count` remains unchanged, `flag` is True indicating there is at least one '01' transition in `s` if it was True initially, `j` is `len(s) - 1`, and `i` is the initially calculated value plus 1.**
