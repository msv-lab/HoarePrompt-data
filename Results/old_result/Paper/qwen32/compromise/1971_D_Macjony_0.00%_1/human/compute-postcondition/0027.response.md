Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is a string with a length greater than 5; `count` is either 2, 3, or 4; `flag` is True if `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False; `j` is 4 if `s[j] == s[j + 1]`, and `j` is 4 or 5 if `s[j] != s[j + 1]`.**
