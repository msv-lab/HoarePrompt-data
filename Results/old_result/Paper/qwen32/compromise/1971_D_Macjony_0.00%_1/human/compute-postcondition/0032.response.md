Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is the input string; `count` is the number of transitions between different characters in the string, minus 1 if `flag` is True; `flag` is True if there is at least one '01' sequence in the string, otherwise False; `j` is `len(s) - 1`.**
