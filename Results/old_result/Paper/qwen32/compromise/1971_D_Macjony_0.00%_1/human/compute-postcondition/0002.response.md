`s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which means it will hold the string input provided by the user. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was initially defined as an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is the string input provided by the user.**
