Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is a string with a length greater than 1; `count` is 2; `flag` is True if the character at position `j` in `s` is '0' and the character at position `j + 1` in `s` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False; `j` is 1 if `flag` becomes True, otherwise `j` remains 0.**
