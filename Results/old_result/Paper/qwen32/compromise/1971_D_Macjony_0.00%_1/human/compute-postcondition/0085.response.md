Postcondition: **`t` is the same input integer, `s` is a string of length at least 3, `count` is 3 if `s[j] != s[j + 1]`, otherwise `count` is 2, `flag` is True if `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'`, otherwise `flag` remains False, `j` is 2 if `flag` is False, and 3 if `flag` is True, `i` is the initially calculated value plus 1, and the character at index `j` of `s` is '1' if `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'`, otherwise it remains the character at index `j` of `s`.**
