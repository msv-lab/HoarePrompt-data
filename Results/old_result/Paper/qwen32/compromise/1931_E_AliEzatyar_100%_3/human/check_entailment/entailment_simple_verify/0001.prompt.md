You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program in the context of the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves a game where Anna and Sasha take turns manipulating a list of integers. Anna reverses the digits of an integer, and Sasha concatenates two integers. The game ends when only one integer remains. Sasha wins if this integer is not less than \(10^m\).

### Key Points of the Game
1. **Anna's Move**: Reverse the digits of an integer.
2. **Sasha's Move**: Concatenate two integers.
3. **Winning Condition**: Sasha wins if the final integer is \(\geq 10^m\).

### Strategy in the Game
- **Anna's Optimal Play**: Anna aims to minimize the final integer.
- **Sasha's Optimal Play**: Sasha aims to maximize the final integer.

### Key Observations
1. **Reversing Digits**: Reversing a number can lead to leading zeros being removed, which can make the number smaller.
2. **Concatenation**: Sasha can concatenate numbers in any order to maximize the final number.

### Analysis of the Program
The provided program seems to focus on the number of trailing zeros in the numbers. Specifically:
- It calculates the total number of digits in the list.
- It counts the number of trailing zeros for each number and stores these counts in a list.
- It sorts these counts in descending order.
- It sums every other count starting from the largest (presumably to account for Sasha's moves).
- It checks if the difference between the total number of digits and the sum of selected trailing zeros is at least \(m + 1\).

### Flaws in the Program
1. **Trailing Zeros Misuse**: The program incorrectly assumes that the number of trailing zeros in a number affects the final result in a way that leads to Sasha winning. Reversing a number does not necessarily make it smaller based on the number of trailing zeros alone.
2. **Concatenation Strategy**: The program does not account for the optimal way Sasha can concatenate numbers to maximize the final result.
3. **Simplification Overlooked**: The program does not consider the actual values of the numbers after Anna's moves and Sasha's concatenations.

### Correctness Evaluation
Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect because it does not accurately model the game dynamics and the optimal strategies for both players.

### Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner based on the given rules and optimal play strategies for both Anna and Sasha.
