The value of `counter` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `counter` is 1 if the current element `num[i]` is '0', otherwise `counter` remains 0. After the increment, `counter` will be 2 if it was initially 1, or 1 if it was initially 0. The values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`num` is a list of test cases with at least one element, `counter` is 2 if `num[i]` was '0' otherwise `counter` is 1, `i` is `i - 1`**.
