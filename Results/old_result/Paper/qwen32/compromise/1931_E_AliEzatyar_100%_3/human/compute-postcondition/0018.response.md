Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num`, which is expected to be a list of test cases. Each test case consists of a list containing two integers `n` and `m`, followed by a list of `n` integers. However, the function does not utilize these test cases in any meaningful way. Instead, it iterates over the elements of `num` from the end to the beginning, counting how many '0' strings it encounters consecutively before encountering a non-'0' value or reaching the start of the list. Regardless of the input values, the function always returns the integer 3.**
