Output State: **`num` is a list of test cases with at least one element. If `num[i]` was '0', then `counter` is 3, otherwise `counter` is 2. `i` is `i + 1`. If `num[i]` was not '0', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The `counter` variable is incremented by 1. If `num[i]` was '0', `counter` was initially 2, so it becomes 3. If `num[i]` was not '0', `counter` was initially 1, so it becomes 2. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
