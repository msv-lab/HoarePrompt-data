The code snippet reads a line of input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings, which are assigned to the variable `data`. This operation does not change the values of `n` or `a`. The variable `input` is a function and remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of cards you and Nene each receive, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line.**
