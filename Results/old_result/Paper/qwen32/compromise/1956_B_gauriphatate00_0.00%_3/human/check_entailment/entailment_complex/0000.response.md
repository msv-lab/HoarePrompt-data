Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally, given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. The core of the solution lies in the function `func_1`, which calculates the minimum between the number of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand and half the number of cards each player receives (`n // 2`). This makes sense because for each integer that appears twice, there is a potential point to be scored if Nene plays optimally to avoid giving you points. However, you can only score points for half of the turns at most, hence the `min(pairs, n // 2)` calculation.

The function `func_2` is responsible for reading the input, processing each test case using `func_1`, and printing the results. It correctly reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of cards and the list of integers representing the cards in your hand, then calls `func_1` to compute the result and stores it. Finally, it prints all the results.

However, there is a mistake in the description of what `func_2` does. The description states that the function computes and prints the number of unique integers that appear exactly once in the list, which is incorrect. Instead, `func_2` computes and prints the result of `func_1` for each test case, which is the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally.

Given the provided example and the logic of the functions, the program appears to be correctly solving the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
