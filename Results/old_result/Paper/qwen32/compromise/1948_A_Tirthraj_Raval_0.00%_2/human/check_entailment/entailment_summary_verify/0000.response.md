### Reasoning:

The original assessment is **incorrect**. The provided program actually constructs the string correctly for even values of `n`. Let's analyze the code in detail to understand why.

The function summary correctly describes the program's behavior:
- If `n` is odd, the program prints "NO".
- If `n` is even, the program prints "YES" followed by a string of length `n` consisting of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters, starting with 'A'.

Let's break down the logic for the even case:
- The loop `for i in range(n // 2)` runs `n // 2` times.
- Inside the loop, `pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])` appends either 'A' or 'B' based on whether `i` is even or odd.
- `pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])` appends the opposite character of the one just added. The expression `i % 2 ^ 1` correctly alternates between 0 and 1, ensuring that the characters alternate between 'A' and 'B'.

Let's verify this with an example:
For `n = 4`:
- `i = 0`: `pattern.append('AB'[0 % 2])` → `pattern.append('A')`
- `i = 0`: `pattern.append('AB'[0 % 2 ^ 1])` → `pattern.append('B')`
- `i = 1`: `pattern.append('AB'[1 % 2])` → `pattern.append('B')`
- `i = 1`: `pattern.append('AB'[1 % 2 ^ 1])` → `pattern.append('A')`

This results in the pattern `['A', 'B', 'B', 'A']`, which is "ABBA". However, this is not the only correct pattern. The pattern "ABAB" is also correct.

The original assessment incorrectly states that the pattern "ABBA" is wrong because it doesn't have exactly 4 special characters. However, "ABBA" does have exactly 4 special characters, at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 (considering 1-based indexing).

Thus, the program is indeed correct for both the odd and even cases as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
