Reasoning: 
The program correctly follows the problem statement and the execution summary. Here's the breakdown:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
3. It checks if `n` is odd. If it is, the program correctly outputs "NO" because an odd number of special characters cannot be formed in a string where each special character is defined as being equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
4. If `n` is even, the program outputs "YES" and constructs a string of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters, starting with 'A'. This construction guarantees that every character in the string will be a special character, as each character will be equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

The example output provided in the problem description is correctly reproduced by the program, which further confirms its correctness.

Correctness: **True**
