The code appends an element to the `pattern` list based on the value of `i % 2`. Given that `i` is 2, `i % 2` equals 0. Therefore, `pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])` appends 'A' (since 'AB'[0] is 'A') to the `pattern` list.

The `pattern` list initially has four elements with the last being 'A'. After appending 'A', `pattern` now has five elements: the original four elements followed by 'A'.

The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` is an even integer and `n` is greater than 2, `pattern` is a list with five elements ending in 'A', `i` is 2**.
