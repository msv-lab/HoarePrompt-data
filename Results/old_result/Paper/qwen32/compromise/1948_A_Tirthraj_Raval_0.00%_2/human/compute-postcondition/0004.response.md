The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes the variables `t` and `n`, but these variables are not used within the provided code snippet. Therefore, the values of `t` and `n` do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, and `n` is an odd integer.
2. The code snippet provided is `print('NO')`.
3. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'` without referencing `t` or `n`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `t` or `n`, the output will always be `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
