The code appends the character at the index `i % 2` of the string `'AB'` to the list `pattern`. Given that `i` is 2, `i % 2` equals 0. Therefore, the character at index 0 of `'AB'` is `'A'`, and it is appended to `pattern`. 

The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The `pattern` list, however, is updated to include the newly appended character.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 49, `n` must be at least 5, `i` is 2, `pattern` is ['A', 'B', 'B', 'A', 'A']**
