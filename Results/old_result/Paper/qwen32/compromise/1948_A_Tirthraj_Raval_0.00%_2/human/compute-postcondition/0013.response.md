The code appends an element to the `pattern` list based on the value of `i % 2 ^ 1`. Given that `i` is 1, we calculate `i % 2 ^ 1` as follows:

- `i % 2` is `1 % 2`, which equals `1`.
- `1 ^ 1` equals `0` (since `^` is the bitwise XOR operator).

Therefore, `'AB'[0]` is `'A'`, and `'A'` is appended to the `pattern` list. The `pattern` list, which initially had three elements ending with `'B'`, now has four elements, with the last element being `'A'`.

No other variables are affected by this code execution.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` is an even integer and `n` is at least 2, `pattern` is a list with four elements, the last of which is 'A', `i` is 1**.
