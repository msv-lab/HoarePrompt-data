In the given task, the for loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. The loop head only involves the variable `i`, which will take on the value of each element in the `results` list during each iteration.

To ensure that the loop executes, the `results` list must contain at least one element. The state of `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts, as it will be assigned the value of the first element in the `results` list during the first iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `results` has at least one element. The value of `i` does not need to be set beforehand since it is determined by the loop.

State: **`results` is a list of `t` elements, where `t` must be at least 1, each element being either `'no'` or `'yes'`**
