The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. The variables `t`, `x`, `y`, and `result` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 1. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `result` do not affect whether the loop will execute, so they remain as specified.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers x and y such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `result` is an empty list**.
