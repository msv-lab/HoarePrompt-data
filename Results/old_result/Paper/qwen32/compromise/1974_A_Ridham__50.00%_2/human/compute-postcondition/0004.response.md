The given code snippet uses the `join` method to concatenate the string representations of each integer in the `result` list, with each integer separated by a newline character (`\n`). 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **`map(str, result)`**: This applies the `str` function to each element in the `result` list, converting each integer to a string.
2. **`'\n'.join(...)`**: This joins all the string elements from the previous step into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).

Since the exact values in the `result` list are not provided, we can't specify the exact numerical output. However, based on the structure of the code, we can describe the output format.

**Output:**
The `print` statement will output each integer from the `result` list on a new line.

Output: **Each integer from the `result` list on a new line (where `result` is a list of integers representing the number of screens required for each test case)**
