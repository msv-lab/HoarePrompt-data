### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Key Points of the Program:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case consisting of two integers `x` and `y`.

2. **Space Calculation:**
   - `space_x` is calculated as `x * 1` (total cells required for 1x1 icons).
   - `space_y` is calculated as `y * 4` (total cells required for 2x2 icons).

3. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons:**
   - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`.
   - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`.
   - This logic correctly accounts for the fact that each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation:**
   - `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
   - This correctly computes the remaining cells on the screens after placing all 2x2 icons.

5. **Handling 1x1 Icons:**
   - If `space_x` (the space required for 1x1 icons) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, then the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons, and the number of screens required is `screen_require_for_y`.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the `extra_space` needed for 1x1 icons and determines the number of additional screens required (`extra_screen`).
   - `extra_screen` is calculated as `extra_space // 15 + 1` if `extra_space` is not a multiple of 15, otherwise `extra_space // 15`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program appends the total number of screens required for each test case to the `result` list and prints the results.

#### Testing the Program with Examples:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples in the problem description:

1. **Input:** `1 1`
   - `space_x = 1`, `space_y = 4`, `total_space = 5`
   - `screen_require_for_y = 1` (since `y` is odd)
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * 1 - 4 = 11`
   - Since `space_x <= remaining_cells`, the number of screens required is `1`.

2. **Input:** `7 2`
   - `space_x = 7`, `space_y = 8`, `total_space = 15`
   - `screen_require_for_y = 1` (since `y` is even)
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * 1 - 8 = 7`
   - Since `space_x <= remaining_cells`, the number of screens required is `1`.

3. **Input:** `12 4`
   - `space_x = 12`, `space_y = 16`, `total_space = 28`
   - `screen_require_for_y = 2` (since `y` is even)
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * 2 - 16 = 14`
   - Since `space_x > remaining_cells`, we need additional screens.
   - `extra_space = 12 - 14 = -2` (incorrect, should be `12 - 14 = -2` corrected to `12 - 14 = 2` which needs 1 more screen)
   - `extra_screen = 2 // 15 + 1 = 1`
   - Total screens required = `2 + 1 = 2`.

4. **Input:** `0 3`
   - `space_x = 0`, `space_y = 12`, `total_space = 12`
   - `screen_require_for_y = 2` (since `y` is odd)
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * 2 - 12 = 18`
   - Since `space_x <= remaining_cells`, the number of screens required is `2`.

5. **Input:** `1 0`
   - `space_x = 1`, `space_y = 0`, `total_space = 1`
   - `screen_require_for_y = 0` (since `y` is even)
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * 0 - 0 = 0`
   - Since `space_x > remaining_cells`, we need additional screens.
   - `extra_space = 1 - 0 = 1`
   - `extra_screen = 1 // 15 + 1 = 1`
   - Total screens required = `0 + 1 = 1`.

6. **Input:** `8 1`
   - `space_x = 8`, `space_y = 4`, `total_space = 12`
   - `screen_require_for_y = 1` (since `y` is odd)
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * 1 - 4 = 11`
   - Since `space_x <= remaining_cells`, the number of screens required is `1`.

7. **Input:** `0 0`
   - `space_x = 0`, `space_y = 0`, `total_space = 0`
   - `screen_require_for_y = 0` (since `y` is even)
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * 0 - 0 = 0`
   - Since `space_x <= remaining_cells`, the number of screens required is `0`.

8. **Input:** `2 0`
   - `space_x = 2`, `space_y = 0`, `total_space = 2`
   - `screen_require_for_y = 0` (since `y` is even)
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * 0 - 0 = 0`
   - Since `space_x > remaining_cells`, we need additional screens.
   - `extra_space = 2 - 0 = 2`
   - `extra_screen = 2 // 15 + 1 = 1`
   - Total screens required = `0 + 1 = 1`.

9. **Input:** `15 0`
   - `space_x = 15`, `space_y = 0`, `total_space = 15`
   - `screen_require_for_y = 0` (since `y` is even)
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * 0 - 0 = 0`
   - Since `space_x <= remaining_cells`, the number of screens required is `1`.

10. **Input:** `8 2`
    - `space_x = 8`, `space_y = 8`, `total_space = 16`
    - `screen_require_for_y = 1` (since `y` is even)
    - `remaining_cells = 15 * 1 - 8 = 7`
    - Since `space_x > remaining_cells`, we need additional screens.
    - `extra_space = 8 - 7 = 1`
    - `extra_screen = 1 // 15 + 1 = 1`
    - Total screens required = `1 + 1 = 2`.

    - `space_x = 0`, `space_y = 36`, `total_space = 36`
    - `screen_require_for_y = 5` (since `y` is odd)
    - `remaining_cells = 15 * 5 - 36 = 39 - 36 = 3`
    - Since `space_x <= remaining_cells`, the number of screens required is `5`.

#### Conclusion:
