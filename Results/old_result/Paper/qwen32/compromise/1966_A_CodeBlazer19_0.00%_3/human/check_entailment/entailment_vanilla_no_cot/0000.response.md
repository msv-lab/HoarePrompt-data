Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It always outputs `k - 1` for each test case, regardless of the input values. The correct approach involves analyzing the frequency of each card number and determining the minimum number of cards that can remain after performing the allowed operations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        from collections import Counter
        count = Counter(l)
        result = 0
        for freq in count.values():
            result += freq % k
        if result == 0:
            result = k
        print(result)

func()
```

This program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each card number and then calculates the minimum number of cards that can remain by summing up the remainders when each count is divided by `k`. If the result is `0`, it means all cards can be completely exchanged, so the minimum number of cards left is `k - 1` (since the last exchange will leave `k - 1` cards).
