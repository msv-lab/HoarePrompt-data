Reasoning:  
The provided function does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function simply outputs `k - 1` for each test case, regardless of the input values `n`, `k`, and the list `c`. This is incorrect because the minimum number of cards you can end up with depends on the frequency of each card number in the list `c`. 

Here's a brief outline of the correct approach:
1. Count the frequency of each card number in the list `c`.
2. For each unique card number, determine how many cards can be removed by repeatedly applying the operation (i.e., exchanging `k` cards for `k-1` cards).
3. Sum up the remaining cards after performing the operations for all unique card numbers.

The provided function does not perform these steps and instead gives a constant output of `k - 1` for every test case, which is not generally correct.

Correctness: **False**
