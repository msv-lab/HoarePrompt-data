In the provided for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `t`, which is used to determine the number of iterations. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The underscore `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we do not plan to use within the loop body.

Since the loop's execution depends solely on the value of `t`, we need to ensure `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The other variable `t` (which is an input integer) does not need to be adjusted in terms of its definition but rather its value.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0**
