### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the primary issue with the provided program: the incorrect input parsing in `func_1()`. The function reads the input as a list of integers using `input().split()`, which is inappropriate for a binary string input. Instead, the input should be read as a string and then processed character by character.

The logic for calculating the cost to make the binary string sorted is correct. The program counts the number of 1s encountered (`n`) and calculates the cost to move each 1 to the end of the string whenever a 0 is encountered after some 1s.

However, the original assessment concludes that the program is incorrect due to the input parsing issue, which is accurate. Therefore, the program, as it stands, is indeed incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
