You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

    #State: s is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, representing a binary string; n is the total number of 1s encountered in the list; ans is the accumulated cost calculated as explained.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the accumulated cost calculated based on the number of 1s in the list s and other unspecified factors)

    #State: `func_1()` has been called `t` times.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's analyze the code and the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts with a minimum cost. The cost of a cyclic shift is defined as the length of the substring being shifted.

### Code Analysis
The provided code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function seems to be processing a single test case. It reads a binary string, counts the number of '1's, and calculates a cost based on the positions of '0's and '1's.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

### Issues in the Code
1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1()` reads the input using `input().split()`, which expects space-separated values. However, the problem statement specifies that the input is a binary string without spaces. This will cause an error when the input is read.
2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**: The logic within `func_1()` does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string. The current logic simply counts the number of '1's and calculates a cost based on the positions of '0's and '1's, which does not account for the actual cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.

### Example to Demonstrate the Issue
Consider the test case:
```
1
101011
```
The correct minimum cost to sort this string is 5, as described in the problem statement. However, the provided code will not produce this result. Instead, it will likely produce an incorrect cost due to the flawed logic.

### Conclusion
The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case and does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
