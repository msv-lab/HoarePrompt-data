You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i is either 0 or 1. There is at least one 1 in each test case's list a.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: t lines, each line containing the count of '0's in the substring of arr between the first and last '1's for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string of `n` characters ('0's and '1's) with at least one '1'. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of '0's between the first and last '1' in the string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to move chips to form a contiguous block with the minimum number of operations. Each operation consists of moving a chip to the nearest free cell to its left.

### Key Observations

1. **Identify the leftmost and rightmost chips**: The minimum number of moves required to form a contiguous block is determined by the distance between the leftmost and rightmost chips and the free cells in between.
2. **Count the free cells between the leftmost and rightmost chips**: The number of operations needed is equal to the number of free cells (`0`s) between the leftmost and rightmost chips.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the program to see if it aligns with the above observations.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the configuration of the ribbon as a string of `0`s and `1`s.

2. **Finding the Leftmost and Rightmost Chips**:
   - `x = arr.find('1')`: This finds the index of the first `1` (leftmost chip).
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')`: This finds the index of the first `1` from the end (rightmost chip). Since the string is reversed, we need to adjust this index to the original string by using `n - y - 1`.

3. **Counting Free Cells Between the Chips**:
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]`: This slice is supposed to capture the substring from the leftmost chip to the rightmost chip. However, `n - y` is incorrect here because `y` is already adjusted for the reversed string. The correct slice should be `arr[x:n - y - 1]` or simply `arr[x:n - y]` if we consider the reversed string's index directly.
   - `print(z.count('0'))`: This counts the number of free cells (`0`s) in the substring, which is the minimum number of operations required.

### Issues in the Program

- **Incorrect Slice Calculation**: The slice `arr[x:n - y]` is incorrect. The correct slice should be `arr[x:n - y - 1]` to account for the reversed index adjustment, or the program should directly use the reversed index without adjusting it.
- **No Adjustment for Reversed Index**: The program does not correctly adjust the reversed index `y` to the original string's index.

### Corrected Program

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y - 1]  # Corrected slice
        print(z.count('0'))

# or alternatively

def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = n - arr[::-1].find('1') - 1  # Correctly adjusted reversed index
        z = arr[x:y + 1]
        print(z.count('0'))
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect due to the incorrect calculation of the slice to count the free cells between the leftmost and rightmost chips.
