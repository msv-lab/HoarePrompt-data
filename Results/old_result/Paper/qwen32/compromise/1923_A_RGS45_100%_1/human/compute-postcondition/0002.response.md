To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the given code:

1. **Initialization**: The initial state includes an integer `t` (which determines the number of iterations), an integer `n` (the length of the list `a`), and a list `a` containing `n` integers, each either 0 or 1. There is at least one 1 in `a`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
    - For each iteration (`for _ in range(t)`):
        - `n` is read from the input (though it's not changing the initial `n` in the context of the problem, it's used to read the next input).
        - `arr` is created by reading a line of input, removing spaces, and joining the characters into a string.
        - `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`.
        - `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` (which corresponds to the last occurrence of '1' in the original `arr`).
        - `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from `x` to `n - y - 1`.
        - The number of '0's in `z` is printed.

3. **Output Calculation**:
    - For each iteration, the code outputs the number of '0's in the substring `z` of `arr` that lies between the first and last '1's in `arr`.

**Output State**: Since the loop runs `t` times, and for each iteration, it prints a value, the output state will consist of `t` lines, each containing the count of '0's in the specified substring for that iteration. The state of `t`, `n`, and `a` remains unchanged in terms of their initial values, but the output is a series of counts of '0's.

Output State: **t lines, each line containing the count of '0's in the substring of arr between the first and last '1's for each iteration.**
