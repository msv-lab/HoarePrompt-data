The code snippet provided only reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Therefore, the value of `t` will be updated based on the input. The other variables (`n`, `a`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` is either 0 or 1. There is at least one 1 in each test case's list `a`.**
