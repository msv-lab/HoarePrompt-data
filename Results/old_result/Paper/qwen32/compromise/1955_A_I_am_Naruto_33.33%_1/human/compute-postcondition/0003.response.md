Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost based on the given criteria. The cost is determined by either `a * n` or `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`, whichever is smaller, unless `n` is 1, in which case the cost is simply `a`. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the calculated minimum cost for each one.**
