### Reasoning:
The given Python program correctly determines whether the three digits in each test case form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or neither ("NONE") based on the provided conditions.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading the Number of Test Cases:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `q` which represents the number of test cases.
   - This is done using `q = int(input())`.

2. **Iterating Through Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - This is achieved using `(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program then checks if the digits form a "STAIR" with the condition `a < b < c`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "STAIR".
   - Next, it checks if the digits form a "PEAK" with the condition `a < b > c`.
   - If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK".
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints "NONE".

4. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the correct response for each test case as per the given conditions.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:** `1 2 3`
  - `a < b < c` is true (1 < 2 < 3), so the output is "STAIR".
- **Test Case 2:** `3 2 1`
  - Neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` is true, so the output is "NONE".
- **Test Case 3:** `1 5 3`
  - `a < b > c` is true (1 < 5 > 3), so the output is "PEAK".
- **Test Case 4:** `3 4 1`
  - `a < b > c` is true (3 < 4 > 1), so the output is "PEAK".
- **Test Case 5:** `0 0 0`
  - Neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` is true, so the output is "NONE".
- **Test Case 6:** `4 1 7`
  - Neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` is true, so the output is "NONE".
- **Test Case 7:** `4 5 7`
  - `a < b < c` is true (4 < 5 < 7), so the output is "STAIR".

The program correctly matches the expected output for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it accurately checks the conditions and outputs the correct results based on the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
