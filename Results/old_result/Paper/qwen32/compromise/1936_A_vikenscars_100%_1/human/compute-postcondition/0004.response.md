In the given task, the for loop is defined as `for i in range(n):`. The loop will execute if `n` is a positive integer. According to the initial state provided, `n` is already described as a positive integer between 2 and 10^4, so `n` does not need to be adjusted.

The variables `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` are also provided in the initial state and are set to `n-1`. These variables are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. The loop head only involves the variable `i` and the range `n`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state to ensure the loop will execute, as `n` is already a positive integer.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation sequence, where 2 <= n <= 10^4; `max_item_idx` is n-1; `pair_idx` is n-1**
