The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `max_item_idx`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation sequence, where `2 <= n <= 10^4`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation sequence, where 2 <= n <= 10^4; `max_item_idx` is 0**.
