### Reasoning:

The provided solution seems to have some logical issues and does not correctly implement the game rules described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Function Call and Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to count trailing zeros in a single number, not in the entire list of test cases.
   - The main loop processes each test case by iterating through the array of numbers, but the function `func_1` is called incorrectly since it's being passed the entire array instead of individual numbers.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `total_digits` and `zeros`**:
   - `total_digits` is correctly calculated as the sum of the lengths of all numbers in the array.
   - However, `zeros` is supposed to collect the number of trailing zeros for each number in the array, but the function `func_1` is incorrectly used, and the results are not correctly aggregated.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner**:
   - The logic for determining the winner is based on the difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero`, but the calculation of `subtract_zero` is incorrect. It should consider the optimal moves of both players, which is not captured in the provided code.
   - The condition `if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:` is not an accurate way to determine the winner based on the game rules.

4. **Typographical Error**:
   - The string `'Sashah'` is used instead of `'Sasha'` in the output, which is a typo.

### Correctness:

Given the above issues, the provided code does not correctly implement the game logic and does not determine the winner accurately based on the rules provided.

**Correctness: False**
