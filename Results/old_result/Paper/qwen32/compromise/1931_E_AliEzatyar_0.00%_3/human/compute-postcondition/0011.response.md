The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the list `num`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `num`. The loop iterates backward from the last index of `num` to 0.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i - 1`, meaning `i` has already been decremented. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1.

Since the loop decrements `i` in each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `i` incremented by 1 from its current value. The list `num` remains unchanged.

Therefore, if `i` was `i - 1` at the end of the last iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i`.

State: **`num` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `i` is `i`**
