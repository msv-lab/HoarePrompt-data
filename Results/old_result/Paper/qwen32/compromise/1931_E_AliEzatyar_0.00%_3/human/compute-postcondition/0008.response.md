The code snippet increments the `counter` variable by 1. The `num` list and the value of `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `i` is `i - 1`, and `counter` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`num` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `i` is `i - 1`, `counter` is incremented by 1**.
