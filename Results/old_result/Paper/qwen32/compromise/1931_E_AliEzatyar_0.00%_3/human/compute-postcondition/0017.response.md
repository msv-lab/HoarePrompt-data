Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `num`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case consists of a list containing two integers `n` and `m`, followed by a list of `n` integers. The function returns the number of trailing '0's in the factorial of the last integer `m` from the last test case in the list.**
