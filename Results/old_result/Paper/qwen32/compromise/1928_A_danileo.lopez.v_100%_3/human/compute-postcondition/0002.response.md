To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand the logic of the loop and how it processes each test case. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The number of test cases, `t`, is read from the input.
2. For each test case, two integers `a` and `b` are read, representing the dimensions of a rectangle.
3. The code checks if either `a` or `b` is even:
   - If `a` is even, it divides `a` into two equal parts (`a1` and `a2`). If these parts are not equal to `b`, it prints 'Yes' and moves to the next test case.
   - If `b` is even, it divides `b` into two equal parts (`b1` and `b2`). If these parts are not equal to `a`, it prints 'Yes' and moves to the next test case.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints 'No'.
4. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it directly prints 'No'.

The loop iterates `t` times, processing each test case independently. The output of the loop is a series of 'Yes' or 'No' responses, one for each test case.

Since the loop processes each test case independently and does not maintain any state across iterations, the only output state we can describe is the series of 'Yes' or 'No' responses. However, since we need to describe the final state in terms of the variables and their values, we can state that after all iterations, the loop will have processed all test cases and will not have any remaining iterations (`_` will have cycled through all values from 0 to `t-1`).

Therefore, the output state can be described as the completion of all iterations with no remaining test cases to process.

Output State: **All test cases processed with no remaining iterations.**
