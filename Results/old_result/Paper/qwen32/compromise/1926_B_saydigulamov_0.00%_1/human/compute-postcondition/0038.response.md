Postcondition: **The loop runs for a total number of times specified by the initial integer input. After all iterations, `b` will be the last string input by the user. `k` will contain the counts of '1's from each string `b` that contained '1' during the loop iterations. If the count of '1's in the first element of `k` is equal to the count of '1's in the second element of `k`, then the program will execute the if part. Otherwise, there is no else part to execute.**
