Postcondition: **`a` is greater than 0, `b` is the last string input by the user, and `k` is a list containing the counts of '1's from all input strings `b` that contained '1'. If the first and second elements of `k` are equal, then the first and second counts of '1's in the respective input strings are the same.**
