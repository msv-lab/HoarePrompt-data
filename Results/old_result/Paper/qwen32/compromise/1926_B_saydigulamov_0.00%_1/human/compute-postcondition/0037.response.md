To determine the output of the print statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state provided:

1. The loop runs for a total number of times specified by the initial integer input.
2. After all iterations, `b` will be the last string input by the user.
3. `k` will contain the counts of '1's from each string `b` that contained '1' during the loop iterations.
4. At this point, the count of '1's in the first element of `k` is equal to the count of '1's in the second element of `k`.

Given these points, `k` is a list that holds the counts of '1's from each string `b` that contained '1's. The precondition further specifies that the first and second elements of `k` have the same count of '1's.

Let's denote:
- `k[0]` as the count of '1's in the first string `b` that contained '1's.
- `k[1]` as the count of '1's in the second string `b` that contained '1's.

Since `k[0]` and `k[1]` are equal, we can denote this count as `n`. Therefore, `k` can be represented as `[n, n]`.

Given this information, the print statement `print(k)` will output the list `[n, n]`.

Since we do not have the exact value of `n` (the count of '1's), we can only describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **[n, n] (where n is the count of '1's in the first and second strings that contained '1's)**
