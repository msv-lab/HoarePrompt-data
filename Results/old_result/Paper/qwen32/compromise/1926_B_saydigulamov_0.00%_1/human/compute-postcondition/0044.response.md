The code appends the count of the character '1' in the string `b` to the list `k`. Since `b` is a new string input by the user that contains the character '1', the count of '1' in `b` is a specific number. The variables `i` and `a` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is 3, `a` remains the same, `b` is a new string input by the user that contains the character '1', and `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in `b`.**
