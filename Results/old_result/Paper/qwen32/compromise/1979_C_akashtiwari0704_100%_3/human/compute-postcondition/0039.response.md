Postcondition: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` is now `prod // a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `a` before the update, `sumo` is the sum of all `a[i]` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `i` is `bets - 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the program continues to execute without further changes. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing all elements of `a` separated by spaces.**
