The code snippet `prod = lcm(a)` updates the value of `prod` to be the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 2, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of all updated elements in `a`, `i` is `bets - 1`.**
