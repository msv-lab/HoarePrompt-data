The code snippet provided modifies the variable `g` by multiplying it with `l[i]` and then dividing the result by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `g` and `l[i]`. This operation effectively updates `g` to be the least common multiple (LCM) of its current value and `l[i]`.

Given the initial state, the value of `g` was `l[i]` (where `i` was initially 0). After the code execution, `i` is 1, so `g` is updated to be the LCM of `l[0]` and `l[1]`.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 1, `g` is the least common multiple of `l[0]` and `l[1]`, `l` is a list with at least two elements, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` is now `prod // a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `a` before the update, `sumo` is the sum of all `a[i]` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `i` is 1**.
