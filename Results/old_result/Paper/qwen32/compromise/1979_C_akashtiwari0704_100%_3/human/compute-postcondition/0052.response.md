The code snippet `bets = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `bets`. None of the other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 1, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` is now `prod // a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `a` before the update, `sumo` is the sum of all `a[i]` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `i` is `bets - 1`.**
