The code snippet appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the `ans` string.

Given the initial state:
- `bets` must be greater than 0.
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `T` is 1.
- `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`.
- `l` is a list with at least one element.
- `a` is a list where each element is updated to `prod // a[i]`.
- `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `a`.
- `sumo` is the sum of all updated elements in `a`.
- `sumo` is less than `prod`.
- `ans` is a string that includes the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space.
- `i` is `bets`.

The only change here is the modification to the `ans` variable. The value of `ans` is updated to include `str(a[i]) + ' '`.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 1, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `a` is a list where each element is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of all updated elements in `a`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string that includes the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space, `i` is `bets`, and `ans` now includes `str(a[i]) + ' '` appended to its previous value.**
