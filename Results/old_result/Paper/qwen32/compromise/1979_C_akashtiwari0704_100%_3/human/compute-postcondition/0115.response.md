The code appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the variable `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `ans` will now include the string representation of `a[0]` followed by a space, then the string representation of `a[1]` followed by another space. The variables `bets` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`bets` is an integer such that `bets > 0`, `i` is 1, `ans` includes the string representation of `a[0]` followed by a space and then the string representation of `a[1]` followed by a space.**
