The code snippet appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the `ans` string. This does not affect any other variables except `ans`.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 1, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `a` is a list where each element is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of all updated elements in `a`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string that includes the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space.**
