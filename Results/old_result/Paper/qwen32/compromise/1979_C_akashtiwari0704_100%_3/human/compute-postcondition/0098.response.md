The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` adds the integer value of `a[i]` to `sumo`. Given the initial state, `i` is `bets - 1`, so `a[i]` is `a[bets - 1]`, which is `prod // a[bets - 1]`. Therefore, `sumo` will be updated to its current value plus `prod // a[bets - 1]`.

Output State: **`bets` is an integer such that `bets > 0`, `t` is an input integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `T` is 2, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index `bets - 1` is `prod // a[bets - 1]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `a`, `sumo` is `sumo + (prod // a[bets - 1])`, `i` is `bets - 1`.**
