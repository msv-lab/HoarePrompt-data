Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `nodes`, which is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighboring nodes, and `start`, which is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, where n is the total number of nodes in the tree. The function returns a list of nodes in the order they are visited starting from the `start` node, performing a traversal of the tree (the specific traversal method is not specified in the provided information).**
