Postcondition: **`nodes` is a defaultdict where the default value for each key is an empty list; `start` is an integer such that 1 <= `start` <= 5; `n` is 5; `t` is 3; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `leaves` is an empty deque; `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`, and there exists at least one element in `moves` that is an odd number.**
