You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is the medium version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on trees.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with a stone on
exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists of picking
an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the stone there
(thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after which he
alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player that
cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who wins
each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding
The game is played on a tree with `n` nodes, and in each round, a stone is placed on one node. Players alternate turns moving the stone to an adjacent, inactive node. The player who cannot make a move loses. The task is to determine the winner of the game if both players play optimally.

### Key Observations
1. **Game Theory Insight**: The outcome of the game depends on the parity (odd or even) of the maximum distance from the starting node to any leaf node in the tree. If this distance is odd, Ron (who starts the game) wins; if it's even, Hermione wins.
2. **Tree Representation**: The tree is represented using an adjacency list (`nodes`).

### Solution Explanation
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the distances from a given starting node to all leaf nodes in the tree.
   - It recursively traverses the tree, collecting distances from the starting node to each leaf node.
   - The distances are stored in a list and returned.
   
2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and determines the winner for the given starting node.
   - It uses `func_1` to get all distances from the starting node to the leaf nodes.
   - It checks if any of these distances are odd. If so, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

### Correctness Analysis
- **Tree Construction**: The tree is correctly constructed using the adjacency list representation.
- **Distance Calculation**: The `func_1` function correctly calculates the distances from the starting node to all leaf nodes.
- **Win Condition**: The game's outcome is correctly determined based on the parity of the maximum distance from the starting node to any leaf node.

### Conclusion
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. Thus, the solution is correct.
