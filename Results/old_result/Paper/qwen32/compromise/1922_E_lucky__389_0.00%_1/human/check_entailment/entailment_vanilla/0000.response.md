To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze it step by step in the context of the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to construct an array of integers such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. An increasing subsequence can be formed by selecting elements from the array in non-decreasing order without changing their order in the array.

### Program Analysis:
The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads an integer `X`, which is the required number of increasing subsequences. The program then attempts to construct an array that meets this requirement.

#### Steps in the Program:
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes a list `subseq_lens` to store lengths of certain subsequences and a variable `mx` to keep track of the maximum length encountered.
2. **Decomposition of X**: The program tries to decompose `X - 1` into a sum of numbers of the form `2^i - 1`. This is done by finding the largest `i` such that `2^(i+1) <= X+1`. The value `2^i - 1` is then subtracted from `X`, and `i` is added to `subseq_lens`.
3. **Array Construction**: The program constructs the array `ansv` based on the values in `subseq_lens`. The array is initialized with the sequence `[0, 1, 2, ..., mx-1]`. Then, it appends the values from `subseq_lens` starting from the second element.
4. **Output**: The program prints the length of the constructed array and the array itself.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Decomposition**: The program attempts to decompose `X - 1` into a sum of numbers of the form `2^i - 1`, but this does not guarantee that the constructed array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The logic for decomposing `X` is flawed and does not correctly map to the problem of constructing the required array.
2. **Inadequate Array Construction**: The array construction logic is not robust and does not guarantee that the array will have the required number of increasing subsequences. The program simply appends values from `subseq_lens` to the array, which does not necessarily create the required number of subsequences.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the decomposition logic and the array construction logic, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible values of `X`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
