To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop condition: `i` and `x`.

The loop condition is:
```
while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
```

### Analysis:
- **`i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
- **`x`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `x` must be at least 3.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the condition `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1` must be true.

### Calculation:
- Current value of `i` is 2.
- The next value of `i` for the next iteration would be 3 (assuming `i` is incremented by 1 inside the loop body).

So, we need to check the condition with `i` being 3:
- `2 ** (3 + 1) = 2 ** 4 = 16`

For the loop to execute one more time, `16` must be less than or equal to `x + 1`:
- `16 <= x + 1`
- `15 <= x`

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `x` must be at least 15. The value of `i` should be 2 at the end of the current iteration to allow it to be incremented to 3 for the next iteration.

State: **`x` must be at least 15; `i` is 2**
