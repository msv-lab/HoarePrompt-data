The code snippet `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The initial state specifies that `i` is increased by 1, but the specific value of `i` before this operation is not provided. Therefore, we can only say that `i` is now increased by 2 from its original value. The variable `x` is mentioned in the initial state but not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`i` is increased by 2 and `x` must be such that `2` (unchanged)**.
