The variable `i` is assigned the value `0`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^18 - 1, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^18 - 1, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 0**
