Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^18 - 1, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the integer `i`, `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and 0, `i` is the largest integer such that `2^i` is less than or equal to `x`, and `i` is not equal to 0**

In natural language: The list `subseq_lens` now contains the integer `i`, which is the largest integer such that `2^i` is less than or equal to `x`. All other variables retain their previous values.
