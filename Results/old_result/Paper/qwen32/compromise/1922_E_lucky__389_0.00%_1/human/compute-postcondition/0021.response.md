The value of `i` is set to 0. The other variables `t`, `x`, `subseq_lens`, and `mx` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= `x` <= 10^18 - 1, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, and `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and 0; `i` is 0.**
