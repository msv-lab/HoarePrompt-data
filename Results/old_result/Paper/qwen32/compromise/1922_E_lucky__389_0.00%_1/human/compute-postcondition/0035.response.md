Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `x` is an integer reduced by 2 if `i` is not 0, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `i` if `i` is not 0, and `i` is 0 if the if condition is met, leading to a break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is reduced by 2 and `mx` is updated accordingly.**
