To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop:

The `while` loop condition is:
```
(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m
```

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is 3
- `y` is 3
- `n` is at least 15

Let's evaluate the current state against the loop condition:

1. `(x + y) * x <= n`
   - Substituting the values: `(3 + 3) * 3 = 6 * 3 = 18`
   - Since `n` is at least 15, `18 <= n` is not necessarily true unless `n` is at least 18.

2. `(x + y) * y <= m`
   - Substituting the values: `(3 + 3) * 3 = 6 * 3 = 18`
   - This condition depends on the value of `m`.

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be true. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 18 and provide no specific constraints on `m` other than it should satisfy `(x + y) * y <= m`, which translates to `18 <= m`.

Thus, the state needs to be modified as follows:
State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 3, `n` must be at least 18, and `m` must be at least 18**
