To determine the output state, we need to consider the given initial state and the effect of calling `func_1()` a third time.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where `0 <= t <= 10^4` (after decrementing by 1 from the previous value).
- `func_1()` has been called twice.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
func_1()
```

This means `func_1()` will be called one more time, making it a total of three calls to `func_1()`.

Since the behavior of `func_1()` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact changes to any variables within the function. However, we know that `func_1()` has been invoked three times now.

Therefore, the only change in the state is that `func_1()` has been called an additional time.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where `0 <= t <= 10^4` (after decrementing by 1 from the previous value); `func_1()` has been called three times.**
