The value of `y` is incremented by 1. Initially, `y` is 1, so after the operation, `y` becomes 2. The other variables (`x`, `n`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 2, `n` is at least 12, and if the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, then `cnt` is the initial `cnt` plus `min(n // 12, m // 4)`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged.**
