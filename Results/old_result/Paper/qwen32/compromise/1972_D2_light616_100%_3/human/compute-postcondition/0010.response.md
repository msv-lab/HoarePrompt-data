To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop statement:

```
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will continue as long as both `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true.

Given the current state:
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `m` must be at least 2.
- `x` is 1.
- `y` is 2.
- The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1.
- `cnt` is `min(n // 2, m // 2)`.

Let's evaluate the conditions:
1. `(x + y) * x <= n` translates to `(1 + 2) * 1 <= n` or `3 <= n`.
2. `(x + y) * y <= m` translates to `(1 + 2) * 2 <= m` or `6 <= m`.

Since `n` must be at least 2, and for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 3. Similarly, since `m` must be at least 2, and for the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 6.

Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 3 and `m` to be at least 6. The values of `x` and `y` do not need to be adjusted because they satisfy the conditions given the new values of `n` and `m`.

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `m` must be at least 6, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, and the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1**.
