To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to ensure that both conditions in the loop's header are satisfied:

1. \((x + y) * x \leq n\)
2. \((x + y) * y \leq m\)

Given the current state:
- `x` is 3
- `y` is 1
- `cnt` is defined as the sum of `min(n // ((3 + y) * 3), m // ((3 + y) * y))` for all `y` from 2 to the original `y` where `gcd(3, y) == 1`
- `n` must be at least 9

Let's evaluate the conditions:

1. \((x + y) * x = (3 + 1) * 3 = 4 * 3 = 12\)
   - This must be less than or equal to `n`.
   - Since `n` must be at least 9, we need to ensure `n` is at least 12.

2. \((x + y) * y = (3 + 1) * 1 = 4 * 1 = 4\)
   - This must be less than or equal to `m`.
   - There is no restriction on `m` given in the problem, so we can assume `m` is at least 4 to satisfy this condition.

Thus, the only variable that needs adjustment is `n` to ensure that the first condition is met.

State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 1, `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((3 + y) * 3), m // ((3 + y) * y))` for all `y` from 2 to the original `y` where `gcd(3, y) == 1`, and `n` must be at least 12**
