For the given task, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the state of the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head contains the variable `_` and the variable `t`.

The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1, because the `range(t)` function will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 up to (but not including) `t`. If `t` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.

Given that `t` is already defined as an input integer representing the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`, it seems that `t` is already in a valid state to ensure the loop executes at least once. However, we should explicitly state that `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in Python loops when the loop variable is not needed. Its value is automatically set by the `range(t)` function during each iteration, so there's no need to adjust its state before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure `t` is at least 1. Since the problem statement specifies that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, we can conclude that `t` is already in a valid state.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`**
