The value of `y` is incremented by 1. Given that `y` was initially 3, it is now 4. The other variables (`x`, `n`, `m`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged. The condition about the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` being 1 and its effect on `cnt` is not directly impacted by the increment of `y`.

Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 4, `n` is at least 10, `m` is at least 15. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, then `cnt` is incremented by at least 1.**
