Output State: **`x` is 3, `y` is the largest value such that `(3 + y) * 3 <= n` and `(3 + y) * y <= m`, `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((3 + y) * 3), m // ((3 + y) * y))` for all `y` from 2 to `y` where `gcd(3, y) == 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `y` and `cnt` depend on the new value of `x` and the conditions provided, but they remain as described in the initial state with the updated `x` value.
