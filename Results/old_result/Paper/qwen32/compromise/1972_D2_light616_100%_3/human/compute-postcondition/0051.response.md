Output State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 4, `n` is at least 18, `m` is at least 18. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, then `cnt` is increased by at least 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `y` has been incremented by 1, making `y` equal to 4. All other variables remain unchanged, including the conditions related to `n`, `m`, and `cnt`.
