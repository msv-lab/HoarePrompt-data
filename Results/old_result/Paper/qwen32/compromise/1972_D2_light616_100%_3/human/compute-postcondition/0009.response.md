Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, then processes each of these `t` test cases by calling `func_1()` for each one. It does not accept any parameters and does not explicitly return any value, but it implicitly returns the results of processing each test case through `func_1()`.**
