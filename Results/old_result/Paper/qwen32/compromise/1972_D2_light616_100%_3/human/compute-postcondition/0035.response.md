To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the given conditions and how the loop progresses.

### Initial State Recap:
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 1
- `y_final` is the largest integer such that `(1 + y_final) * y_final > m`
- `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // (1 + y), m // ((1 + y) * y))` for all `y` from 2 to `y_final`
- `n` must be at least 9

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.

### Iteration Details:
1. **First Iteration** (`y = 2`):
   - `(x + y) * x = 6` which should be `<= n`
   - `(x + y) * y = 6` which should be `<= m`
   - `gcd(2, 2) = 2` so `cnt` does not change.

2. **Second Iteration** (`y = 3`):
   - `(x + y) * x = 15` which should be `<= n`
   - `(x + y) * y = 18` which should be `<= m`
   - `gcd(2, 3) = 1` so `cnt` increases by `min(n // 15, m // 18)`.

3. **Third Iteration** (`y = 4`):
   - `(x + y) * x = 24` which should be `<= n`
   - `(x + y) * y = 32` which should be `<= m`
   - `gcd(2, 4) = 2` so `cnt` does not change.

### Determining `y_final`:
`y_final` is the largest integer such that `(1 + y_final) * y_final > m`.

### Continuing the Loop:
Let's assume `m` is large enough to allow further iterations. We'll check the next possible value for `y`.

4. **Fourth Iteration** (`y = 5`):
   - `(x + y) * x = 35` which should be `<= n`
   - `(x + y) * y = 40` which should be `<= m`
   - `gcd(2, 5) = 1` so `cnt` increases by `min(n // 35, m // 40)`.

We continue this process until the loop condition fails.

### Final State:
Given the constraints and the pattern, the loop will stop when `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`. Since `x` is fixed at 2, `y` will increment until one of these conditions is met.

Assuming `n` and `m` are sufficiently large to allow several iterations, let's consider the final state where `y` has reached its maximum value before the loop terminates.

### Conclusion:
The loop will terminate when `y` reaches a value such that either `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`. Given the pattern and the constraints, the final state will be:

- `x` remains 2.
- `y` will be the last value that satisfies the loop condition.
- `cnt` will be incremented by the sum of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for each valid `y` where `gcd(x, y) == 1`.

Given the provided outputs and the pattern, the final state can be described as:

Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is the largest value such that `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`, `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all `y` from 2 to `y` where `gcd(x, y) == 1`.**

In simpler terms, `y` will be the largest integer that keeps the loop running, and `cnt` will reflect the sum of the valid increments based on the GCD condition.
