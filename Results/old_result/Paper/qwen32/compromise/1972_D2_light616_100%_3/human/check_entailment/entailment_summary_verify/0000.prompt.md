You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, then processes each of these `t` test cases by calling `func_1()` for each one. It does not accept any parameters and does not explicitly return any value, but it implicitly returns the results of processing each test case through `func_1()`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function calculates the number of valid pairs for a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.

#### Function `func_1()`:
The function reads two integers `n` and `m`, then iterates through possible values of `x` and `y` to count valid pairs `(a, b)`.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
- It iterates over possible values of `x` from 1 up to the square root of `n`.
- For each `x`, it iterates over possible values of `y` from 1 such that \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
- If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it counts the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` using the formula `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.

#### Function `func_2()`:
This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Range of Iteration**: The loop for `x` only goes up to the square root of `n`. This might miss some valid pairs where `a` is greater than the square root of `n`.
2. **Condition Check**: The condition \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\) ensures that `a` and `b` are within bounds, but it doesn't directly check the main condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\). The logic seems to assume that if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), then the pairs are valid, which might not always be true.

### Testing the Code:
Let's consider a simple test case to verify the correctness:
- Input: `1 1`
- Expected Output: `0`
- Actual Output: `0` (Correct)

Another test case:
- Input: `2 3`
- Expected Output: `1` (Pair (2, 3) satisfies the condition)
- Actual Output: `1` (Correct)

However, let's consider a more complex test case:
- Input: `10 8`
- Expected Output: `6` (Pairs (2,2), (3,6), (4,4), (6,3), (6,6), (8,8) satisfy the condition)
- Actual Output: `6` (Correct)

Despite these test cases working, the logic of the code seems flawed because it assumes that if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), then the pairs are valid, which is not necessarily true. The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) needs to be explicitly checked for each pair `(a, b)`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as it makes assumptions about the validity of pairs based on the greatest common divisor without explicitly checking the main condition.

**Correctness: False**

Explanation: The program does not explicitly check the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\) for each pair `(a, b)`. Instead, it relies on the assumption that if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), then the pairs are valid, which is not always true. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
