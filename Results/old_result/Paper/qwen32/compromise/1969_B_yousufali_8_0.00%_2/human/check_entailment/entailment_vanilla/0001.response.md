Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem statement to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s followed by all 1s) by performing cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

### Key Observations:
1. **Cost Calculation**: The cost to move a 1 to the right of a 0 is the length of the substring that includes the 1 and all preceding 0s.
2. **Strategy**: Whenever we encounter a 0 after one or more 1s, we need to shift the substring containing these 1s and the 0 to the right of the 0s. The cost of each such shift is the number of 1s before the 0 plus one (the 0 itself).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of two functions:
- `func_1()`: This function reads a binary string, counts the number of 1s encountered, and calculates the cost whenever a 0 is encountered after one or more 1s.
- `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1()` is incorrectly using `input().split()`, which splits the input based on whitespace. For a binary string, we should just read the string directly using `input()` and then process it.
2. **Conversion to List of Integers**: The function `func_1()` converts the input string to a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This is incorrect for a single string input. It should be `list(input())` to convert the string into a list of characters.
3. **Logic for Cost Calculation**: The logic for calculating the cost is correct. When a 0 is encountered after one or more 1s, the cost is incremented by the number of 1s seen so far plus one.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    s = list(input().strip())  # Read the binary string and convert to list of characters
    n = 0  # Counter for number of 1s
    ans = 0  # Total cost
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':  # If the character is '1'
            n += 1
        elif s[i] == '0' and n != 0:  # If the character is '0' and there were 1s before it
            ans += n + 1  # Add the cost of moving these 1s to the right
    print(ans)

def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())  # Read the number of test cases
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()  # Process each test case

# Call the main function to handle input and output
func_2()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to improper input handling and conversion. After correcting these issues, the logic for calculating the cost is correct.

**Correctness: False**
