Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The `func_1()` function is incorrectly reading the input. It uses `input().split()`, which assumes that the input string `s` has spaces between each character, which is not the case. The input string `s` is a binary string without spaces.

2. **Logic Error**: The logic implemented in `func_1()` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the string. The approach seems to be counting the number of '1's encountered before a '0' and adding `n + 1` to the answer, which does not align with the problem's requirements for calculating the cost of cyclic shifts.

3. **Output**: The program prints the answer for each test case, which is correct, but the calculation of the answer is incorrect.

To solve the problem correctly, one must find the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. This involves more complex logic, possibly involving dynamic programming or a greedy approach, to determine the optimal sequence of shifts. The current implementation does not address these aspects correctly.
