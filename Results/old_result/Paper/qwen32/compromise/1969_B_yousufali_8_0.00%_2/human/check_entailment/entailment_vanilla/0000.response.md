Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires determining the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length \( r - l + 1 \) is \( r - l + 1 \).

### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to handle the logic for a single test case.
   - It reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers.
   - It initializes `n` to count the number of `1`s encountered and `ans` to accumulate the total cost.
   - It iterates through the string `s`:
     - If it encounters a `1`, it increments `n`.
     - If it encounters a `0` and `n` is not zero (indicating that there have been `1`s before this `0`), it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints the accumulated cost `ans`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis

Let's examine if the logic in `func_1` correctly computes the minimum cost to sort the binary string.

The logic in `func_1` is based on the following observation: every time a `0` is encountered after one or more `1`s, it signifies that a cyclic shift is needed to move the `1`s before the `0` to the right. The cost of such a shift is `n + 1`, where `n` is the number of `1`s encountered before the `0`.

However, this logic does not correctly account for the minimum cost to sort the string. The correct approach involves:

- Counting the number of `1`s and `0`s.
- Calculating the cost based on the relative positions of `1`s and `0`s, which involves more complex logic than simply adding `n + 1` for each `0` after a `1`.

The provided program does not implement this complex logic and thus does not correctly compute the minimum cost for sorting the string.

### Conclusion

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimum cost to sort the binary string.

**Correctness: False**
