Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's analyze why:

The problem requires us to cyclically shift substrings of a binary string in such a way that the total cost (sum of lengths of the substrings shifted) is minimized to sort the string in non-descending order. The provided program does not implement this logic correctly.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` expects a list of integers as input, which is not appropriate for the problem. The problem specifies that the input is a binary string, not a list of integers.
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.

2. **Logic for Calculating Cost**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to calculate the cost based on the number of '1's encountered before '0's. This logic does not correctly account for the cost of cyclic shifts required to sort the string.
   - The provided logic does not consider the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to sort the string. It simply adds the number of '1's plus one each time a '0' is encountered after '1's, which is not an accurate or optimal way to calculate the cost.

### Example where the program does not work correctly:

Consider the input string `101011`:

- The provided program would process this string as follows:
  - It encounters the first '1', increments `n` to 1.
  - It encounters the second character '0', adds `n + 1` (which is 2) to `ans`.
  - It encounters the third character '1', increments `n` to 2.
  - It encounters the fourth character '0', adds `n + 1` (which is 3) to `ans`.
  - It encounters the fifth character '1', increments `n` to 3.
  - It encounters the sixth character '1', increments `n` to 4.
  - The final value of `ans` would be 2 + 3 = 5, which is incorrect.

- The correct minimum cost to sort `101011` is 5, but the steps and logic used by the program are not optimal and do not correctly calculate this cost.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
