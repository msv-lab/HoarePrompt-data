Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is the loop variable; `string` is an input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `x` is the first character of `string`; `count` is greater than 0; if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then `done` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, or if `count2` equals `count` and `count` is greater than 1, or if `count` is equal to 1 and `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is set to 1 and `done` remains `False`.**
