The provided Python code snippet contains a `print(1)` statement. This statement will print the integer `1` regardless of the values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `count`, `count2`, `done`, `j`) mentioned in the initial state. The value `1` is explicitly provided in the `print` function and does not depend on any of the other variables.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **1**
