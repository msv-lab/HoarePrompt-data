Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be set beforehand, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `string`, `done` is `False`. If the length of `string` is 1, then `s` contains exactly one character and `n` equals 1.**
