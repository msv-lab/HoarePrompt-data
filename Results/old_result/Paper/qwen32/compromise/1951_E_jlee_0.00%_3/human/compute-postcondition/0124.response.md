To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(string[:j], string[j:])`, we need to understand the context and the variables involved:

- `string` is the input string with length `n`.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `j` is the loop variable, which is incremented in each iteration of the loop.
- The loop continues until `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` or `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1.

The loop variable `j` is incremented until one of the conditions in the loop is met. Specifically:
1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, the loop breaks.
2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` (the first character of `string`) and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to `j`.

Given these conditions, the value of `j` will be the first index where the character does not match its corresponding character from the end of the string, or the first index where the character is not equal to the first character of the string and `count` is less than 1.

The `print` statement then prints two parts of the string:
- `string[:j]`: This is the substring from the start of the string up to (but not including) the index `j`.
- `string[j:]`: This is the substring from the index `j` to the end of the string.

Since we do not have the specific input string or the exact value of `j`, we can only describe the output in terms of `j`.

Output: **string[:j], string[j:] (where j is the first index where s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j] or s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1)**
