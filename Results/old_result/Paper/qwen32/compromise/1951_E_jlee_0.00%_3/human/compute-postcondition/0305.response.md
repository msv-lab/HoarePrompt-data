Postcondition: **`done` is False, `j` is (n + 1) // 2 - 1, `count` and `count2` reflect the state after the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `string` is the user input, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `string`, and `x` is the first character of `string`. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the conditions remain unchanged.**
