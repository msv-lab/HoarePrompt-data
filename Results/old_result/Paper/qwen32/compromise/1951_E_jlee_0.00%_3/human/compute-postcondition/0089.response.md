Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine the output of the `print` statement.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `i` is a loop variable.
3. `string` is an input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1.
4. `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
5. `n` is the length of `string`.
6. `x` is the first character of `string`.
7. `count2` is 0 unless `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, in which case `count2` is set to 1.
8. `j` is the current value of the loop variable incremented by 1.
9. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` remains `False`.
10. `count` is `j` if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('YES')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The value `'YES'` is explicitly provided in the code and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print('YES')` statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
