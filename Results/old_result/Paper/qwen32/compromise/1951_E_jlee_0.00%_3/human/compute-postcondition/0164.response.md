Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `string` is the new input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is the length of the new `string`; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `done` is `False`; `count` and `count2` are integers based on the loop conditions; `j` is the loop variable iterating from 0 to `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. If `n` is 1, the conditions remain the same as described in the precondition. Otherwise, the conditions remain the same as described in the precondition with no additional changes. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `string`, the conditions remain as specified.**
