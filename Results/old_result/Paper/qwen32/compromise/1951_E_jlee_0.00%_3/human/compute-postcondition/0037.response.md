Given the initial state, we have:

- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is the loop variable (though it is not used in the provided print statement).
- `string` is an input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `string`.
- `done` is `False`.
- `x` is the first character of `string`.
- `count` is 0.
- `count2` is 0.
- `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` (this condition seems to be related to a loop or a specific check but is not directly used in the print statement).

The provided print statement is:
```python
print(1)
```

This statement simply prints the integer `1`. None of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state affect the value being printed by this statement. Therefore, the output is straightforward.

Output: **1**
