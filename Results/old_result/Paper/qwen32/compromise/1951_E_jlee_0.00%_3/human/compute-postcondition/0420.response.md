Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `done`: A boolean variable that is set to `True` if the character at position `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at position `n - 1 - j` in `s` or if `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`. Otherwise, `done` remains `False`.
   - `j`: An integer set to 1.
   - `count`: An integer that is set to 1 if `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
   - `count2`: An integer that is set to 1 if `count > 1` and `s[j] == x`; otherwise, it is set to `count2 + 1` if `s[j] == x` and `count > 0`; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
   - `i`: An integer that is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `string`: A string input by the user.
   - `s`: A list of characters from `string`.
   - `n`: The length of `s` (must be at least 1).
   - `x`: The first character of `string`.

2. **Additional Conditions:**
   - If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the conditions remain unchanged.
   - If `s.count(x) == n` or `s.count(x) == n - 1`, the conditions remain unchanged.
   - If `n` is odd and the middle character of `s` is not equal to `x`, the conditions remain unchanged.
   - The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `done` is set to `True`.

### Given Code Snippet:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

### Analysis:
- `string[:j]` will print the substring of `string` from the beginning up to (but not including) the character at index `j`.
- `string[j:]` will print the substring of `string` from the character at index `j` to the end of the string.

### Step-by-Step Execution:
1. `j` is initialized to 1.
2. `string[:j]` will therefore be the substring from the beginning up to (but not including) the character at index 1.
3. `string[j:]` will be the substring from the character at index 1 to the end of the string.

### Example:
Let's assume `string` is `"example"`:
- `s` will be `['e', 'x', 'a', 'm', 'p', 'l', 'e']`.
- `n` will be 7.
- `x` will be `'e'`.

Given `j = 1`:
- `string[:j]` will be `"e"`.
- `string[j:]` will be `"xample"`.

### Output:
Output: **e xample**
