Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is the loop variable; `string` is an input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `x` is the first character of `string`; `count2` is 0 unless `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, in which case `count2` is set to 1; `done` is `True`; `j` is the current value of the loop variable incremented by 1; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
