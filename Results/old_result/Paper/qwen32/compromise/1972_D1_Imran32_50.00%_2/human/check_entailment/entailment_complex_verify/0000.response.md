### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided code. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Function Naming and Parameters:**
   - The function `func_1()` does not reflect the problem it is intended to solve. It should be named more descriptively, and it should take `n` and `m` as parameters, not `n` and `k`.

2. **Incorrect Variable Usage:**
   - The variable `k` is used instead of `m` in the input parsing. This is a clear error since the problem statement specifies `m` as the second input parameter.

3. **Logic Error:**
   - The logic inside the loop does not correctly address the problem's requirements. The code computes a value `ans` based on a formula that does not check whether `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Instead, it performs a different computation involving the square root of `n` and sums of `(n + i) // (i * i)`.

4. **Example Test Case:**
   - The provided test case `1 2 3` should yield an output of `3` based on the valid pairs `(1, 1)`, `(2, 1)`, and `(2, 2)`. The given code does not produce this output, further confirming the logical error.

### Annotations Analysis:
- The annotations describe the state of the program before and after the function call but do not address the logical errors present in the code. They simply restate what the code is doing without validating it against the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. It contains logical errors and does not produce the expected output for the given test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
