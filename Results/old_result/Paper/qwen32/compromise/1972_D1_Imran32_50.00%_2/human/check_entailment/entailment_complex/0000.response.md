Reasoning:  
The provided Python program is intended to solve a different problem than the one described in the problem statement. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the annotated program does not implement this logic. Instead, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (note that \(k\) is used instead of \(m\)), initializes `ans` to \(n\), and then iterates from 2 up to the square root of \(n\) plus one, adding \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `ans` for each \(i\). Finally, it prints the computed `ans`.

This logic does not match the problem's requirements. Specifically, it does not involve calculating the greatest common divisor (gcd) or checking the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for any pairs \((a, b)\).

Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
