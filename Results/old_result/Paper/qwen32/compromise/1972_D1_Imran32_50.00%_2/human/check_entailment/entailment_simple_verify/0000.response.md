### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis:**
   The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
   - \(1 \le a \le n\)
   - \(1 \le b \le m\)
   - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Code Analysis:**
   The provided code does not implement the logic described in the problem statement. Instead, it appears to be attempting to solve a different problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of the code and its annotations:

   ```python
   import math

   t = int(input())
   for _ in range(t):
       func_1()

   def func_1():
       n, k = map(int, input().split())  # `k` should be `m` as per the problem statement
       ans = n
       root = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1
       for i in range(2, root + 1):
           cnt = i * i
           ans += (n + i) // cnt
       print(ans)
   ```

   **Annotations:**
   - The state of the program right before the function call indicates that `t` is the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers.
   - Inside `func_1`, `n` and `k` are read from input, where `k` should be `m`.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n` and then incremented by the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for \(i\) in the range from 2 to \(\sqrt{n} + 1\).
   - The final result `ans` is printed.

3. **Verification Against Problem Requirements:**
   - The code does not correctly implement the condition that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The variable `k` is used instead of `m`, which is incorrect.
   - The logic inside the loop does not check the required condition for valid pairs \((a, b)\).

4. **Example Test Case:**
   For the test case:
   ```
   1
   2 3
   ```
   - Expected Output: `3` (pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\)).
   - The provided code will not produce this output because it does not correctly check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The logic and the variable names do not align with the problem requirements.

**Final: False**
