To determine if the given program correctly solves the problem, let's analyze each function and their roles in the overall solution.

### Function Analysis:

1. **func_1(a):**
   - This function generates all subarray sums of the array `a` and returns them sorted.
   - It iterates through each starting point of the subarray and then iterates through each ending point, calculating the sum of the subarray and appending it to the list `cts`.

2. **func_2(cts):**
   - This function takes a list of subarray sums (`cts`) and returns a new list (`odds`) where each element appears an odd number of times.
   - It iterates through `cts`, and if an element is already in `odds`, it removes it (indicating it has appeared an even number of times). If not, it adds it (indicating it has appeared an odd number of times).

3. **func_3(odds, n):**
   - This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the list of subarray sums that appear an odd number of times (`odds`).
   - It initializes an array `a` of size `n` with zeros and fills it by calculating the differences between consecutive elements in `odds`. Since the array is a palindrome, it assigns the same value to symmetric positions.

4. **func_4(bigList, smallList):**
   - This function finds the missing subarray sum by comparing two lists: `bigList` (which should contain all subarray sums) and `smallList` (which contains all but one subarray sum).
   - It removes common elements from the end of both lists until they differ, and returns the last differing element from `bigList`.

### Overall Solution Analysis:

- The program aims to reconstruct a palindrome array `a` from the given subarray sums.
- The key insight is that the missing subarray sum will be the only one that appears an odd number of times among all possible subarray sums.
- By generating all possible subarray sums, identifying the ones that appear an odd number of times, and reconstructing the array from these, the program attempts to find a valid palindrome.

### Issues and Corrections:

- The program does not explicitly generate all possible subarray sums to compare with the given sums. Instead, it relies on the fact that the missing sum will be the only one appearing an odd number of times.
- The approach of using `func_2` to filter out sums that appear an even number of times is correct under the assumption that the input guarantees a unique solution.
- However, the implementation of `func_4` is unnecessary since the missing sum can be directly inferred from the odd-counted sums.

### Conclusion:

Given the assumptions and the problem constraints, the program seems to correctly identify and use the odd-counted sums to reconstruct the palindrome array. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
