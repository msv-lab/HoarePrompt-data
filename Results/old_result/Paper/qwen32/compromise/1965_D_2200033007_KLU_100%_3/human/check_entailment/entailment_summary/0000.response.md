### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the code and the functions to see if they correctly solve the problem described.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to recover a palindrome array `a` from given sums of all but one of its subarrays. The key points are:
- `a` is a palindrome.
- We have sums of all subarrays except one.
- We need to find the missing subarray sum and reconstruct `a`.

#### Analysis of the Provided Functions:

1. **func_1(a)**:
   - This function generates all subarray sums of a given array `a`.
   - It iterates through each element and calculates the cumulative sum from that element to the end.
   - It then sorts these sums.
   - **Issue**: The function is correctly implemented for generating subarray sums, but it doesn't seem to be used correctly in the main logic since the output of `func_1` is not directly compared with `subarraySums`.

2. **func_2(cts)**:
   - This function removes consecutive duplicates from a list.
   - It iterates through the list and adds elements to a new list unless the current element is the same as the last added element.
   - **Issue**: The function is used to filter out consecutive duplicates, which is useful, but it's unclear how this helps in finding the missing subarray sum.

3. **func_3(odds, n)**:
   - This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from a list of unique subarray sums.
   - It initializes an array `a` of size `n` with zeros.
   - It iterates through the list `odds` and assigns values to `a` based on the difference between consecutive elements.
   - **Issue**: The function is supposed to reconstruct the array, but the provided output hint suggests it always returns `[2, -2, 5, -2, 0]` regardless of the input, which is incorrect.

4. **func_4(bigList, smallList)**:
   - This function compares two lists and removes matching elements from the end of `bigList` that are also present in `smallList`.
   - It returns the last remaining element of `bigList`.
   - **Issue**: This function seems to be used to find the missing subarray sum, but the logic is not clear and might not be correct.

#### Main Logic Issues:
- The main logic involves sorting `subarraySums` and using `func_2` to filter out consecutive duplicates.
- Depending on the length of the filtered list `odds`, different paths are taken to find the missing subarray sum.
- The final reconstruction of the array `a` relies on `func_3`, which has a fixed output that is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with `func_3` always returning the same incorrect output and the lack of clear logic for finding the missing subarray sum, the overall program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
