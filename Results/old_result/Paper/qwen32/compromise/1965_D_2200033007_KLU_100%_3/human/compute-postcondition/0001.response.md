The `pop()` method removes the last element from the list `bigList`. Since `smallList` is a subset of the elements at the end of `bigList` and must have at least one element, removing the last element from `bigList` could affect whether `smallList` remains a subset of the end of `bigList`.

Given the initial conditions, after executing `bigList.pop()`, the last element of `bigList` is removed. If the last element of `bigList` was also the last element of `smallList`, then `smallList` will no longer be a subset of the end of `bigList` in the same order. However, since the problem does not specify that `smallList` should remain a subset after the operation, we only need to reflect the change in `bigList`.

Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last element removed, `smallList` is a list of integers (unchanged)**.
