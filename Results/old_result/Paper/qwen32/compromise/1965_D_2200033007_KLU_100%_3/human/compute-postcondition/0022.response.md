Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing the sums of certain subarrays of the palindrome array `a` and must contain at least three integers; `x` is the third element in the `odds` list. If `idx == n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is equal to `odds[1]`. Otherwise, `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are both equal to `(x - prev) // 2`. `prev` is now equal to `x`. `idx` is decreased by 1. `a[n - 1 - idx]` is updated to `(x - prev) // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `a[n - 1 - idx]` is updated to `(x - prev) // 2`. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
