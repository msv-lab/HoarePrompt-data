The code appends the value of `sm` to the list `cts`. Given that `sm` is `2 * a[j]` and `j` is 3, the value being appended to `cts` is `2 * a[3]`.

Output State: **`a` remains the same, `cts` will be `[a[0], a[0] + a[1], a[0] + a[1] + a[2], ..., sum(a), a[1], a[1] + a[2], ..., sum(a) - a[0], a[3], 2 * a[3]]`, `sm` is `2 * a[3]`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `len(a)` must be greater than 2**.
