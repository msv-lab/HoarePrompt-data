#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list `a` of positive integers, representing a palindrome, and returns a sorted list of all cumulative sums starting from each element in `a` to the end of the list.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns a new list with all consecutive duplicate integers removed.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of integers `odds` and an integer `n`, and returns a specific list `[2, -2, 5, -2, 0]` regardless of the input values, as long as `n` satisfies the condition 3 <= n <= 1000.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists of integers, `bigList` and `smallList`, where `smallList` is a subset of the last elements of `bigList` in the same order. It removes the elements from the end of `bigList` that match `smallList` and returns the last remaining element of `bigList`.
