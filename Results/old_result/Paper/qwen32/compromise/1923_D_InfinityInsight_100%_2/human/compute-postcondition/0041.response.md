Output State: **`a` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 4, `left` is `[0, a[0], a[0] + a[1], ..., sum(a)]`, `ans` at index `i` is `1`, `last` is unchanged, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`, and `inx` is equal to `inx2` if `inx` was less than 0; otherwise, `inx` remains unchanged, `i` is 4`.**

In simple terms: The value of `ans` at index `i` (which is 4) is now `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
