Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n = len(a)` and `2 <= n <= 3 * 10^5`. Each element in `a` satisfies `1 <= a[i] <= 10^9`. `left` is a list with a single element `[0]`. `ans` is a list of integers, initially all elements are `-1`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `last` is a list with two elements `[-1, i]`. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `last` is `[-1, -1]`. `i` is 2; `last` is `[-1, i, i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the last element of the list `last` to itself. Initially, `last` is either `[-1, i]` or `[-1, -1]`. Since `i` is 2, the last element of `last` is `i` (which is 2). Therefore, `last` becomes `[-1, i, i]` or `[-1, -1, -1]` depending on the initial value of `last`. The values of `a`, `n`, `left`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.
