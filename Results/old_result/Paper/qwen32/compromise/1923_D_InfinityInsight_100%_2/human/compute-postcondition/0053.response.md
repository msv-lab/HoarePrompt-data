Output State: **`a` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 4, `left` is `[0, a[0], a[0] + a[1], ..., sum(a)]`, `ans` at index `i` is `1`, `ans[4]` is `5 - inx`, `last` is unchanged, `x` is `left[4] - a[4] - 1`, `inx2` is `last[3]`, `i` is 5.**

Explanation: The value of `ans[i]` (which is `ans[5]` since `i` is 5) is set to `1`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the given initial state.
