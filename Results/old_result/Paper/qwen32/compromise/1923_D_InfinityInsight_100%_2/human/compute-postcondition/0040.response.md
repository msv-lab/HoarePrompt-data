The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the loop variable that will be incremented in the next iteration. Since the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, `i` must be incremented by 1 for the next iteration to start.

State: **`a` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `left` is `[0, a[0], a[0] + a[1], ..., sum(a)]`, `ans` at index `i` is `i + 1 - inx`, `last` is unchanged, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`, and `inx` is equal to `inx2` if `inx` was less than 0; otherwise, `inx` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more specific:
- `i` was 3 in the previous iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 4.
- `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to continue.

State: **`a` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 4, `left` is `[0, a[0], a[0] + a[1], ..., sum(a)]`, `ans` at index `i` is `i + 1 - inx`, `last` is unchanged, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`, and `inx` is equal to `inx2` if `inx` was less than 0; otherwise, `inx` remains unchanged, `i` is 4**.
