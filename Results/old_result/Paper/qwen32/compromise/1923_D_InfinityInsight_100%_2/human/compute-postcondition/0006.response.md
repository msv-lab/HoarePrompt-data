Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n = len(a)` and `2 <= n <= 3 * 10^5`. Each element in `a` satisfies `1 <= a[i] <= 10^9`. `left` is a list with a single element `[0]`. `last` is a list with a single element `[-1]`. `ans` is a list of integers, initially all elements are `-1`. Additionally, `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]`.**
