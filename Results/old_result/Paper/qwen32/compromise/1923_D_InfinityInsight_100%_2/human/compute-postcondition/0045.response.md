To determine the output state, we need to focus on the variable `inx`, which is reassigned by the function call `func_1(left, x)`. The other variables remain unchanged unless explicitly modified.

Given:
- `a` is unchanged.
- `n` is greater than 4.
- `left` is `[0, a[0], a[0] + a[1], ..., sum(a)]`.
- `ans` at index `i` is `1` if `a[i] < a[i - 1]`; otherwise, `ans` at index `i` remains `i + 1 - inx`.
- `last` is unchanged.
- `x` is `left[4] - a[4] - 1`.
- `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`.
- `inx` is equal to `inx2` if `inx` was less than 0; otherwise, `inx` remains unchanged.
- `i` is 4.

The line `inx = func_1(left, x)` indicates that `inx` is now the result of the function `func_1` with the arguments `left` and `x`.

Output State: **`a` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 4, `left` is `[0, a[0], a[0] + a[1], ..., sum(a)]`, `ans` at index `i` is `1` if `a[i] < a[i - 1]`; otherwise, `ans` at index `i` remains `i + 1 - inx`, `last` is unchanged, `x` is `left[4] - a[4] - 1`, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, `i` is 4.**

In natural language: The value of `inx` has been updated to the result of the function `func_1` with `left` and `x` as arguments. All other variables remain unchanged.
