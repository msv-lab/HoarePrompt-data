The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and goes to the next iteration of the loop. Given the context, it seems like the code is inside a loop, and the `continue` statement will skip the remaining part of the current iteration and proceed to the next one.

Since the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, the output state will be the same as the initial state except that the loop will proceed to the next iteration.

Output State: **`a` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 4, `left` is `[0, a[0], a[0] + a[1], ..., sum(a)]`, `ans` at index `i` is `1` if `a[i] < a[i - 1]`; otherwise, `ans` at index `i` remains `i + 1 - inx`, `ans[4]` is `5 - inx`, `last` is unchanged, `x` is `left[5] - a[5] - 1`, `inx2` is `last[4]`, `i` is 5, `inx` is `last[4]` if `inx2 < inx`. If `inx2 >= inx`, `inx` retains its original value returned by `func_1(left, x)`. The loop proceeds to the next iteration.**
