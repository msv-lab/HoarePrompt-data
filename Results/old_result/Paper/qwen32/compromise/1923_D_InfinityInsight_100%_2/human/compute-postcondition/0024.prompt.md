Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: - `a` remains unchanged as a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes.
- `n` remains unchanged as the length of the list `a`.
- `left` remains unchanged as a list with a single element `[0]`.
- `ans` remains unchanged as a list of integers, initially all elements are `-1`.
- `last` will be a list of indices where the slime sizes change, with the first element being `-1` and subsequent elements indicating the last index of a change.

In natural language, after all iterations, the `last` list will contain `-1` as its first element, followed by indices that indicate where the slime sizes change. The `ans` list and `left` list remain unchanged from their initial states, and `a` and `n` retain their initial values.

Output State:
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    left.append(left[-1] + i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `left` is a list with two elements `[0, i]`, `ans` is a list of integers, initially all elements are `-1`, `last` is a list of indices where the slime sizes change, with the first element being `-1` and subsequent elements indicating the last index of a change.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `left` is `[0, i, 2*i]`, `ans` is a list of integers, initially all elements are `-1`, `last` is a list of indices where the slime sizes change, with the first element being `-1` and subsequent elements indicating the last index of a change.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `left` is `[0, i, 2*i, 3*i]`, `ans` is a list of integers, initially all elements are `-1`, `last` is a list of indices where the slime sizes change, with the first element being `-1` and subsequent elements indicating the last index of a change, `i` is the next element in the list `a`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
