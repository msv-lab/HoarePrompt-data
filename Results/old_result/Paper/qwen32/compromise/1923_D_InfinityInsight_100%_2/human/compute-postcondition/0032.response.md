The code snippet `inx2 = last[i - 1]` assigns the value of `last[i - 1]` to the variable `inx2`. This means that `inx2` now holds the value that was previously stored at index `i - 1` of the list `last`.

Given the initial state, the only change is the introduction of `inx2` with its new value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `left` is `[0, a[0], a[0] + a[1], ..., sum(a)]`, `ans` at index `i` is `1` if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans` at index `i` remains unchanged, `last` is unchanged, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`**.
