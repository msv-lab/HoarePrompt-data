You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program and determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Understanding
The problem involves a list of slimes, each with a specific size. Slimes can eat their neighbors if they are strictly larger, and we need to determine the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten, or determine if it is impossible.

### Program Analysis
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, x)`: This function uses binary search to find the position in the list `a` where `x` would fit, and returns the index + 1 if `x` is found, or the index where `x` would fit otherwise. If `x` is less than 0, it returns -1.
2. `func_2(a, n)`: This function calculates the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten. It uses a list `left` to store cumulative sums of slime sizes, and a list `last` to store the last index where a slime size was different from the previous one.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of `func_2`:
- It initializes `left` with a 0 and `last` with -1.
- It iterates through the slime sizes to populate `last` with the index of the last different slime size.
- It then constructs `left` to store cumulative sums of slime sizes.
- For each slime, if it is smaller than the previous one, it sets the answer to 1 (since it will be eaten immediately).
- Otherwise, it calculates a value `x` and uses `func_1` to find the position in `left` where `x` would fit. It also considers the last index of different slime size.
- It calculates the answer based on the found index and stores it in `ans`.

### Issues in the Program
The program seems to have logical errors in the way it calculates the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten. The approach of using cumulative sums and binary search does not directly address the problem requirements, especially the condition that a slime can only eat its neighbor if it is strictly larger.

### Correctness
Given the complexity and the specific requirements of the problem, the provided program does not seem to correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. The approach of using cumulative sums and binary search does not align with the problem's conditions and does not ensure that the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten is correctly calculated.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
