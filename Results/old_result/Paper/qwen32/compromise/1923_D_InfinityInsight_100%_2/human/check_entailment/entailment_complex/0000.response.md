### Reasoning:

To determine if the provided Python program is correct, we need to verify that the logic implemented in `func_1` and `func_2` aligns with the problem description and the given execution states.

#### Function `func_1`:

- **Purpose**: To find the position of an element `x` in a sorted list `a`.
- **Logic**:
  - If `x` is negative, it returns `-1`.
  - Otherwise, it uses `bisect_left` to find the insertion point of `x` in `a`.
  - If the element at the insertion point is equal to `x`, it returns the index + 1.
  - Otherwise, it returns the insertion point.

This function seems to be correctly implemented for its intended purpose.

#### Function `func_2`:

- **Purpose**: To calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime.
- **Logic**:
  - It initializes `left` to keep a cumulative sum of slime sizes.
  - It initializes `last` to keep track of the last index where the size of the slime changed.
  - It initializes `ans` to store the result for each slime.
  - It iterates over the slimes and updates `ans` based on the conditions:
    - If a slime is smaller than its previous neighbor, it can be eaten in 1 second.
    - Otherwise, it calculates the position where the current slime could be eaten by a larger slime using `func_1`.
    - It updates `ans` with the minimum number of seconds required for each slime to be eaten.

The logic in `func_2` seems to follow the problem description, but there are some points to consider:

- The use of cumulative sums (`left`) and the `bisect_left` function in `func_1` helps in efficiently finding the position where a slime can be eaten.
- The `last` list helps in keeping track of the last index where the size of the slime changes, which is useful for determining the position to check for possible eating.

#### Main Logic:

- The main logic runs `func_2` twice: once for the original list and once for the reversed list.
- It updates the `ans` list with the minimum number of seconds required for each slime to be eaten, considering both directions.

### Verification:

The given program seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The use of cumulative sums and binary search (`bisect_left`) ensures that the solution is efficient and meets the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:

Based on the provided logic and the problem description, the program appears to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
