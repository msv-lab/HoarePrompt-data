Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains a logical error in the condition `if bx >= ax:`. According to the problem statement, `bx` should represent the maximum value from constraints of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), and `ax` should represent the minimum value from constraints of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x). If `bx` (minimum allowed value) is greater than `ax` (maximum allowed value), then there are no valid values for `k`, and the result should be `0`. However, the current implementation incorrectly appends `0` when `bx >= ax`.

The issue arises because the loop `for i in cx:` that counts how many excluded values fall within the range `[bx, ax]` is executed only when `bx < ax`. If `bx >= ax`, the loop is skipped, and `tmp` remains `0`. Therefore, the expression `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` will not be evaluated, and the result will be `0` due to the initial `if bx >= ax:` check, which is correct. However, the logic inside the `else` block is flawed because it assumes that `bx < ax` and calculates the number of valid `k` values accordingly.

To fix this, the condition `if bx >= ax:` should be corrected to `if bx > ax:` to ensure that the program correctly identifies cases where no valid `k` values exist. When `bx == ax`, there is exactly one valid `k` value, which should be checked separately.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        cx = set()
        ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
        bx = -1
        for _ in range(n):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        if bx > ax:
            r.append(0)
        elif bx == ax:
            r.append(1 if bx not in cx else 0)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
    print(*r, sep='\n')
```

This corrected version properly handles the case where `bx == ax` and ensures that the program works correctly for all potential cases.
