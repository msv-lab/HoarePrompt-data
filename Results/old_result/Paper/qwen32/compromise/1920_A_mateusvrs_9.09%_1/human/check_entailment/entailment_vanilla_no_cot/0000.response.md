Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Constraints Types**:
   - Type 1: `k >= x`
   - Type 2: `k <= x`
   - Type 3: `k != x`

2. **Guarantees**:
   - There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2.
   - No two constraints are the same.
   - The answer is guaranteed to be finite.

3. **Objective**:
   - Determine the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
- **Initialization**:
  - `t`: Number of test cases.
  - `r`: List to store results for each test case.
  
- **Processing Each Test Case**:
  - `n`: Number of constraints.
  - `cx`: Set to store values for constraints of type 3 (`k != x`).
  - `ax`: Initialized to a large value (`1000000000 + 7`), representing the maximum possible upper bound.
  - `bx`: Initialized to `-1`, representing the minimum possible lower bound.
  
- **Reading Constraints**:
  - For each constraint, update `ax` and `bx` based on the type of constraint.
    - Type 1: Update `bx` to be the maximum of its current value and `x`.
    - Type 2: Update `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and `x`.
    - Type 3: Add `x` to the set `cx`.

- **Checking Feasibility**:
  - If `bx >= ax`, it means there is no possible value of `k` that satisfies both the lower and upper bounds, so append `0` to `r`.
  - Otherwise, calculate the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` excluding those in `cx`.
    - Initialize `tmp` to `0` to count how many elements in `cx` fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
    - Iterate over `cx` and increment `tmp` for each element that falls within the range.
    - Append the result `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` to `r`.

- **Output**:
  - Print all results stored in `r`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Condition for Feasibility**: The condition `if bx >= ax:` is correct. If `bx` (minimum possible value) is greater than or equal to `ax` (maximum possible value), no `k` can satisfy both bounds.
- **Counting Valid `k` Values**:
  - The logic for counting valid `k` values is mostly correct but there is a potential issue with the loop that counts elements in `cx` within the range `[bx, ax]`. The loop should correctly count these elements, but the logic is sound.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where there are no valid `k` values correctly by returning `0`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. There are no apparent logical errors in the code.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
