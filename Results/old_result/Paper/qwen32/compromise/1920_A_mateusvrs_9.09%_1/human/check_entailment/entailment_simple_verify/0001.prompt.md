You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - It initializes an empty list `r` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It initializes:
     - `cx` as an empty set to store values that `k` cannot be (from constraints of type 3).
     - `ax` to a very large value (`1000000000 + 7`) to represent the upper bound (from constraints of type 2).
     - `bx` to `-1` to represent the lower bound (from constraints of type 1).

3. **Reading Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, it reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - If `a == 1`, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and the current `bx` (to ensure `k` is at least `x`).
   - If `a == 2`, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and the current `ax` (to ensure `k` is at most `x`).
   - If `a == 3`, it adds `x` to the set `cx` (to ensure `k` is not equal to `x`).

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx >= ax`. If true, it means there are no integers `k` that can satisfy both the lower and upper bounds simultaneously, so it appends `0` to the results list `r`.
   - If `bx < ax`, it calculates the number of integers between `bx` and `ax` inclusive, excluding those in `cx`.

5. **Counting Valid Integers:**
   - It initializes `tmp` to `0` to count how many elements in `cx` fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
   - It iterates over each element in `cx` and increments `tmp` if the element is within the range.
   - Finally, it calculates the number of valid integers as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` and appends this to the results list `r`.

6. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results separated by newlines.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints.
- It ensures that the lower bound `bx` is never greater than the upper bound `ax`.
- It correctly counts and excludes the values that `k` cannot be from the final count.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
