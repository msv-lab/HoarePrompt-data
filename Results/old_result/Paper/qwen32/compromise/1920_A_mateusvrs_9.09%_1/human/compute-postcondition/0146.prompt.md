Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100. Each of the following `n` lines contains two integers `a` and `x` where `a` ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2. All pairs (`a`, `x`) are distinct. `r` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cx = set()
    ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
    bx = -1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, x = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1:
            bx = max(x, bx)
        elif a == 2:
            ax = min(x, ax)
        else:
            cx.add(x)
    if bx >= ax:
        r.append(0)
    else:
        tmp = 0
        for i in cx:
            if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                tmp += 1
        r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is the total number of iterations; `cx` is a set containing all unique values of `x` where `a` was 3; `ax` is the minimum value of `x` where `a` was 2; `bx` is the maximum value of `x` where `a` was 1. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` contains an additional element `0`. Otherwise, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that satisfy `bx` ≤ `i` ≤ `ax`, and `r` now includes the new element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `n` is 0; `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values added when `a` was 3; `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` was encountered; `bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` was encountered; `r` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop. If `bx` ≥ `ax`, `r` includes an additional `0`. If `bx` < `ax`, `r` includes the newly added element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that satisfy `bx ≤ i ≤ ax`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 498; `n` is 0; `ax` is the minimum value of `x` when `a == 2`; `bx` is the maximum value of `x` when `a == 1`; `cx` is a set of unique `x` values when `a` is neither 1 nor 2; `r` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` includes `[0]`. If `bx` is less than `ax`, `r` includes `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that satisfy `bx ≤ i ≤ ax`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
