Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 498; `n` is 0; `ax` is the minimum value of `x` when `a == 2`; `bx` is the maximum value of `x` when `a == 1`; `cx` is a set of unique `x` values when `a` is neither 1 nor 2 and must contain at least one element; `r` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop; `bx` is less than `ax`; `tmp` is 1; `i` is an integer such that `bx` ≤ `i` ≤ `ax`.**

Natural Language: The value of `tmp` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
