The code snippet `ax = min(x, ax)` updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `x`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 498 (unchanged).
- `n` is an integer greater than 0 and is now `n-1` (unchanged).
- `ax` is 1000000007 unless `a` equals 2 and `x` is less than 1000000007, in which case `ax` is `x`.
- `r` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop (unchanged).
- `a` is `a_input` (unchanged).
- `x` is `x_input` (unchanged).
- `bx` is the maximum of `x_input` and -1 if `a_input` equals 1, otherwise `bx` is -1 (unchanged).
- `cx` is a set containing the value `x_input` if `a_input` does not equal 1 and `a_input` does not equal 2 (unchanged).

After executing `ax = min(x, ax)`, the new value of `ax` will be the smaller of the current `ax` and `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 498; `n` is an integer greater than 0 and is now `n-1`; `ax` is the minimum of `x_input` and 1000000007 (or `x_input` if `a` equals 2 and `x_input` is less than 1000000007); `r` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop; `a` is `a_input`; `x` is `x_input`; `bx` is the maximum of `x_input` and -1 if `a_input` equals 1, otherwise `bx` is -1; `cx` is a set containing the value `x_input` if `a_input` does not equal 1 and `a_input` does not equal 2.**
