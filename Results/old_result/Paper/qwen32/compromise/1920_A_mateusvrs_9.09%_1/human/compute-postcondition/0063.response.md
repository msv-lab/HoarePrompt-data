Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0; `cx` is a set containing `x`; `ax` is 1000000007; `bx` is -1; `a` and `x` are the integers read from the input; `a` is not equal to 1 and `a` is not equal to 2.**

Explanation: The set `cx` now contains the element `x` after the execution of `cx.add(x)`. All other variables retain their initial values.
