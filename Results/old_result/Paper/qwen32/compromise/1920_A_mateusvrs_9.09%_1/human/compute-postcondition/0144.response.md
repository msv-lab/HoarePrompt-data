The given code snippet appends a calculated value to the list `r`. The calculation involves `ax`, `bx`, and `tmp`. Here's the updated state:

- `r` now includes an additional element which is the result of `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `ax`, `bx`, `cx`, `tmp`) retain their initial values unless explicitly mentioned.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 498; `n` is 0; `ax` is the minimum value of `x` when `a == 2`; `bx` is the maximum value of `x` when `a == 1`; `cx` is a set of unique `x` values when `a` is neither 1 nor 2; `r` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop, including the new element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`; `bx` is less than `ax`; `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that satisfy `bx ≤ i ≤ ax`.**
