The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`. This means the values of `a` and `x` will be updated based on the input.

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, and `bx` remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the code snippet. Since the code snippet only updates `a` and `x`, these are the only variables whose values will change.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is greater than 0; `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the single element `x`; `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is 1 or not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007; `bx` is `max(x, -1)` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1; `a` and `x` are the two integers read from the input.**

In simpler terms, the values of `t`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, and `bx` remain the same as per their initial definitions, while `a` and `x` are updated to the values read from the input.
