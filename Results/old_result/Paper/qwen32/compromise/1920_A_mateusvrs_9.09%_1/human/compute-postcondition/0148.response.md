Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and `n` pairs of integers `(a, x)`. The integer `a` can be either 1, 2, or 3, and `x` is a positive integer up to 10^9. The function processes these inputs according to the constraints and returns a result for each test case.**
