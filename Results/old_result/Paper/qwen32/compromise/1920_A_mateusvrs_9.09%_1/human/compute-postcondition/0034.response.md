The code snippet `r.append(0)` adds the integer `0` to the end of the list `r`. This means that the list `r` now contains one more element, which is `0`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is the total number of iterations; `cx` is a set containing all unique values of `x` where `a` was 3; `ax` is the minimum value of `x` where `a` was 2; `bx` is the maximum value of `x` where `a` was 1; the current value of `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`; `r` contains an additional element `0`.**
