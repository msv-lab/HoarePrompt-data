The code snippet increments the value of `tmp` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is the total number of iterations; `cx` is a set containing at least one element; `ax` is the minimum value of `x` where `a` was 2; `bx` is the maximum value of `x` where `a` was 1; `bx` is less than `ax`; `tmp` is 1; `i` is an integer such that `bx` ≤ `i` ≤ `ax`.**
