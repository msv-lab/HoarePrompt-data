The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use. The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`, which is the number of times the loop will iterate.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12
- `ans_list` is an empty list

The only state we need to adjust to ensure the loop executes is the value that will be returned by `int(input())`. Since `t` is already defined as an integer between 1 and 100, we can ensure that the loop executes by making sure that `int(input())` returns a value equal to `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list, and `int(input())` returns `t`**
