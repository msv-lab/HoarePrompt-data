Postcondition: **`ans` is increased by `dif` if `k >= dif * 6`, otherwise `ans` is `a[0]` if `dif` is 0, or `a[0] + dif` if `dif` is not 0. `res` is decreased by 1 if `k >= dif * 6`, otherwise `res` is `n - 5` if `dif` is 0, or `n - 3` if `dif` is not 0. `ans_list` contains the updated `ans`. `n` is at least 6. `k` is decreased by `dif * 6` if `k >= dif * 6`, otherwise `k` is 0. `a` is the sorted list of integers read from the input. `dif` is `a[6] - a[5]`. `i` is 5.**
