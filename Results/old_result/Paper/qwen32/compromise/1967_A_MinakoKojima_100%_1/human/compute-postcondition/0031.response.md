The value of `res` is decremented by 1. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, `n` is `t`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list, `dif` is `a[n] - a[n - 1]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `res` is decreased by 1.**
