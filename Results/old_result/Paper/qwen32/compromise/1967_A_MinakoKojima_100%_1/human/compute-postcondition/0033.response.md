The code snippet `ans += dif` adds the value of `dif` to the variable `ans`. Since `dif` is initially defined as `a[n] - a[n - 1]`, the value of `ans` will be updated to include this difference. Other variables remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, `n` is `t`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list, `dif` is `a[n] - a[n - 1]`, `i` is `n - 1`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1, `ans` is `dif`.**
