The code snippet `k -= dif * (i + 1)` modifies the value of `k` by subtracting `dif * (i + 1)` from it. Given that `i` is 5, the expression `i + 1` evaluates to 6. Therefore, `k` is decreased by `dif * 6`.

Output State: **`ans` is increased by `dif`; `dif` is unchanged; `res` is unchanged; `ans_list` contains the updated `ans`; `n` is at least 6; `k` is decreased by `dif * 6`; `a` is the sorted list of integers read from the input; `i` is 5.**
