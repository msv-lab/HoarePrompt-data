The code snippet `res += k % (i + 1)` modifies the value of `res` by adding the result of `k % (i + 1)` to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `ans_list`, `dif`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, `n` is `t`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list, `dif` is `a[n - 1] - a[n - 2]`, `i` is `n - 2`, and `ans` is increased by `k // (t - 1)`. `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`.**
