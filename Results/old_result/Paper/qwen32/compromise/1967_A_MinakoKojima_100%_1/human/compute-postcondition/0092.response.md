Postcondition: **`ans` is `a[0] + dif` if `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, otherwise `ans` is `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`. `res` is `n - 2` if `k >= dif * (i + 1)` and `i` is not 0, `n - 1` if `k < dif * (i + 1)` and `i` is 0, and `n - 1 + k % (i + 1)` if `k < dif * (i + 1)` and `i` is not 0. `k` is `k - dif * (i + 1)` if `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, otherwise `k` is 0. `ans_list` contains `ans`. `n` is at least 2, `a` is the sorted list of integers read from the input, and `dif` is not 0.**
