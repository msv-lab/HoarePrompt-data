The code snippet reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. This means `a` is updated with the new list of integers, but it does not affect the values of `ans`, `res`, `k`, `ans_list`, or `n`.

Output State: **`ans` is the maximum possible value based on the differences in the list `a`, plus `k // n` if `k` was not 0, now updated to `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1)`, `res` remains 0, `k` remains 0, `ans_list` contains `ans`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `a` is the list of integers read from the input.**
