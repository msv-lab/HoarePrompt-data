The provided Python code snippet updates the values of `n` and `k` based on the input. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are integers within certain bounds, and `int(input())` returns `t`. However, the code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively.

Given that `int(input())` returns `t`, we can infer that the first integer read from the input is `t`. Therefore, `n` will be assigned the value of `t`, and `k` will be assigned the second integer from the input.

Since the second integer is not specified, we can only say that `k` is an integer read from the input. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `ans_list`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is `t`, `k` is an integer read from the input, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list.**
