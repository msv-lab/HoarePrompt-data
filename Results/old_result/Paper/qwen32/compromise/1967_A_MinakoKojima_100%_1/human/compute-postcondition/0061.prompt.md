Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is `t`, `k` is an integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list, `ans` is `a[0]`, `res` is `n - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
    if dif == 0:
        res -= 1
    if dif != 0:
        if k >= dif * (i + 1):
            ans += dif
            k -= dif * (i + 1)
            res -= 1
        else:
            ans += k // (i + 1)
            if i != 0:
                res += k % (i + 1)
            k = 0
            break
        if k == 0:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, `n` is `t`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list, and `dif` is not 0. If `k` is 0, `ans` is updated to `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`, and if `i` is not 0, `res` is updated to `n - 1 + k % (i + 1)`. If `i` is 0, `res` is `n - 1`. There are no consecutive equal elements in the list `a`. The code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k` is 0. If `k` is not 0, the state of `k`, `ans`, and `res` is not specified by the given conditions. If `dif` is 0, there are at least two consecutive equal elements in the list `a` and no changes are made to `ans` or `res`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, `n` is `t`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list, `dif` is `a[n] - a[n - 1]`, and `i` is `n - 1`. If `dif` is not 0, `k` remains unchanged. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, `n` is `t`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list, `dif` is `a[n - 1] - a[n - 2]`, and `i` is `n - 2`. If `dif` is not 0, the state remains unchanged. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
