Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `k` is `k - dif * (i + 1)`, `a`, `ans_list` remain unchanged. If `dif` (which is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`) is 0, then `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. `ans` is updated to `ans + dif`. `res` is decreased by 1.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `res` is decreased by 1. All other variables (`n`, `i`, `k`, `a`, `ans_list`, `dif`, and `ans`) remain unchanged according to the provided conditions.
