The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`, and `n` is `t` (which is between 2 and 100). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` should be `n - 1`.

Since `n` is `t` and `t` is between 2 and 100, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be `n - 1` and `n` must be `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, `n` is `t`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list, and `dif` is not 0. `i` is `n - 1`.**
