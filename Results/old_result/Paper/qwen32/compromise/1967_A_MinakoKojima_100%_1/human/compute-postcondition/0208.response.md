For the given task, we need to consider the loop head and adjust the states accordingly. The loop head in this case only involves the variable `a` and the list `ans_list`. The loop iterates over each element in `ans_list`, assigning each element to `a` in each iteration.

Given:
- State at the end of the previous iteration: `ans_list` must contain at least one element.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `ans_list`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `a` would have been assigned the last element of `ans_list` that was processed.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `ans_list` must still have elements left to process after the previous iteration.

Since the loop body is omitted, we don't know exactly what happens to `ans_list` inside the loop. However, based on the loop structure, we can infer that `ans_list` should still have elements for the loop to continue.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we assume that `ans_list` still contains elements, and `a` was assigned the last processed element. For the next iteration, `a` will be assigned the next element in `ans_list`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `ans_list` still contains elements and `a` is about to be assigned the next element.

State: **`ans_list` must contain at least one element** (implying there are still elements left to process). Since `a` is the loop variable and gets assigned the next element in each iteration, we don't need to specify a particular value for `a` at the start of the iteration, as it will be assigned the next element in `ans_list`.

State: **`ans_list` must contain at least one element**
