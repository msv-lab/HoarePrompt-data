The initial state provided only mentions that `ans_list` must contain at least one element. However, the print statement is trying to print the variable `a`, which is not mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the value of `a` based on the given information.

Since `a` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot provide a precise description of what will be printed. The variable `a` is undefined in this context, and attempting to print it will result in a `NameError`.

Output: **NameError: name 'a' is not defined**
