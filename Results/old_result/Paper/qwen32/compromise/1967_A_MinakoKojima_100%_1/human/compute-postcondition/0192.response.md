Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `k` is 0, `a`, `ans_list`, `dif`, `res`, and `ans` remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of `n`, `i`, `k`, `a`, `ans_list`, `dif`, `res`, and `ans` remain the same as in the initial state. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
