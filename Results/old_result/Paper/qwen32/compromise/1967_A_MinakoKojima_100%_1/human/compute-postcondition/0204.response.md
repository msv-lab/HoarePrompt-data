Output State: **`ans` is the final incremented value plus `k // n` if `k` is not 0, plus `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)` plus `res`; `res` is the remaining differences not covered by `k` plus `k % n` if `k` is not 0; `k` is 0 or the remaining amount; `ans_list` contains the final `ans` and the newly appended `ans` if `k` is not 0; `a` and `dif` remain unchanged.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `ans_list` now contains an additional element, which is the current value of `ans`. All other variables (`ans`, `res`, `k`, `a`, and `dif`) remain unchanged with their respective values as described in the initial state.
