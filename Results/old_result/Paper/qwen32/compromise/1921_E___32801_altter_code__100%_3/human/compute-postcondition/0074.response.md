The code `y2 += a` modifies the value of `y2` by adding `a` to it. Given the initial state, `a` is defined as `m - y1`. Therefore, the new value of `y2` will be `y2 + (m - y1)`.

Let's update the value of `y2` in the output state and keep all other conditions and variables as they were described in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `r` is a list of integers, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + a`, `y1` is `m`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `y2 + (m - y1)`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` remain as described in the initial state, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `(x2 - x1)` is an even number, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `y1` is greater than `y2`, `a` is `m - y1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.**
