You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

- Function Summary: 
The function reads input values representing dimensions and coordinates, then determines and prints the result of a game based on the given conditions. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the logic and compare it with the problem description and examples.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial Conditions and Moves:**
   - Alice's chip moves down, down-left, or down-right.
   - Bob's chip moves up, up-left, or up-right.
   - The game ends if a player lands on the opponent's chip or if a player cannot make a move.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If Alice and Bob are in the same row, the player who starts (Alice) can only win if they can move to the same column as the other player in their next move.
   - If Alice is above Bob, Alice needs to be able to reach Bob's row and column in an optimal number of moves.
   - If Bob is above Alice, Bob needs to be able to reach Alice's row and column in an optimal number of moves.
   - If neither player can reach the other's position in an optimal number of moves, the game ends in a draw.

3. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each case.
   - For each test case, it reads the board dimensions and the initial positions of Alice and Bob.
   - It checks if Bob's row is less than or equal to Alice's row. If so, it prints "draw" because Bob cannot move up to Alice's row.
   - If the difference in rows between Bob and Alice is odd, the program checks if Alice can move to Bob's column in one move. If she can, Alice wins.
   - If the difference in rows is even, the program checks if Bob can move to Alice's column in one move. If he can, Bob wins.
   - The program then simulates the optimal moves for both players and checks if one can reach the other's position. If neither can, it prints "draw".

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program's logic for determining the winner seems to be based on the parity of the row difference and the ability to move to the same column in one move.
   - However, the program does not correctly simulate the optimal moves for both players in all scenarios.
   - The logic for checking if a player can win after the initial checks is flawed. It does not correctly account for all possible moves and positions.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:** `6 5 2 2 5 3`
  - Alice is at (2, 2), Bob at (5, 3).
  - The difference in rows is 3 (odd), and Alice cannot move to Bob's column in one move.
  - The program should simulate moves but incorrectly prints "draw".

- **Test Case 2:** `4 1 2 1 4 1`
  - Alice is at (2, 1), Bob at (4, 1).
  - The difference in rows is 2 (even), and Bob can move to Alice's position in one move.
  - The program correctly prints "Bob".

- **Test Case 3:** `1 4 1 3 1 1`
  - Alice is at (1, 3), Bob at (1, 1).
  - Both are in the same row, and neither can move.
  - The program correctly prints "Draw".

- **Test Case 4:** `5 5 1 4 5 2`
  - Alice is at (1, 4), Bob at (5, 2).
  - The difference in rows is 4 (even), and Bob cannot move to Alice's column in one move.
  - The program should simulate moves but incorrectly prints "draw".

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly simulate the optimal moves for both players in all scenarios and incorrectly handles some cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
