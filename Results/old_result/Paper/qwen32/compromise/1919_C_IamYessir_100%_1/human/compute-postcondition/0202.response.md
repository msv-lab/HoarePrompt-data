The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `a`. This affects the list `a` by adding a new element to it. The values of other variables remain unchanged unless they depend directly on the list `a`. Since `x` is defined based on the last element of `a`, `x` will be updated to `lit[i]` after the append operation. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `b`, `cp`, `y`, `s`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` and `b` are lists containing elements `lit[i]` based on the conditions `lit[i] > x` if `x > y`, otherwise `lit[i] > y` for `a`, and `lit[i] <= x` if `x > y`, otherwise `y >= lit[i] > x` for `b`; `cp` is 0; `x` is `lit[i]`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `i` is `i + 1`.**
