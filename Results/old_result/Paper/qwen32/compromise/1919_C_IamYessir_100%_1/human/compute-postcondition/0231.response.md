The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range over `b`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` and ensure the loop can continue executing.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `b` is a list that must have at least `i + 1` elements.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `s` is either `s_initial + 1` or `s_initial` depending on whether `b[i] > b[i - 1]`.

For the next iteration:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `b`.

Given that `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 2`.

State: **`b` is a list that must have at least `i + 2` elements, `i` is `i + 2`**.
