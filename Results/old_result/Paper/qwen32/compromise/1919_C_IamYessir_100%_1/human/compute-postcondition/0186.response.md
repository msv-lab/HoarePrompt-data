Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` and `b` are lists containing elements `lit[i]` based on the conditions `lit[i] > x` if `x > y`, otherwise `lit[i] > y` for `a`, and `lit[i] <= x` if `x > y`, otherwise `y >= lit[i] > x` for `b`; `cp` is 0; `x` is `lit[i]` if `a` was previously empty and `x == y`, otherwise it remains the last element of `a` or is updated to `lit[i]` based on the conditions described in the else part; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b` or is updated to `lit[i]` based on the conditions described in the else part; `s` is incremented by 1 if `lit[i]` is greater than the previous element in `a` or `b` based on the conditions described in the else part; `i` is `i + 1`.**
