Postcondition: **`s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element (potentially increased by 1). `n` is an input integer greater than 0. `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string. `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and if `x < lit[4]`, `a` includes `lit[4]` as its last element, updating `x` to `lit[4]`. `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and if `lit[4] > y`, `b` includes `lit[4]` as its last element, updating `y` to `lit[4]` and incrementing `s` by 1 if `lit[4] > x` and `lit[4] > y`. `cp` is 0. `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is updated based on the conditions described. If `b` was initially empty, `y` is `float('inf')`; otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. `i` is 4. If `lit[4] > y`, `b` includes `lit[4]` as its last element, `y` is updated to `lit[4]`, and `s` is incremented by 1 if `lit[4] > x`. If `y >= lit[4]` and `lit[4] > x`, `b` includes `lit[4]` as its last element. If `lit[4] <= y`, then `b` and `s` remain unchanged.**
