The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `b`. This affects the list `b` and potentially the variable `y` if `b` was previously empty.

Given the initial state, `b` could be either an empty list or not. If `b` was empty, then `y` was `float('inf')`. After appending `lit[i]` to `b`, `y` will no longer be `float('inf')` but will be the last element of `b`, which is `lit[i]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `cp`, `x`, `s`, and `i`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and contains elements `lit[i]` based on the condition `lit[i] > x` if `x > y`, otherwise `lit[i] > y`; `b` is a list containing elements `lit[i]` based on the condition `lit[i] <= x` if `x > y`, otherwise `y >= lit[i] > x`; `cp` is 0; `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, or the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty; `y` is the last element of `b` which is `lit[i]`; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `i` is `i + 1`.**
