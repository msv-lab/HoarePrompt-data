The provided code snippet appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. This operation affects the list `b` and potentially the variable `y` if `b` was previously empty. The variables `t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `cp`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Here's the breakdown:
- `b` is updated to include the new element `lit[i]`.
- If `b` was previously empty, `y` is now set to `lit[i]`.
- If `b` was not empty, `y` remains the last element of `b` before the new element was appended, but since `y` is supposed to be the last element of `b` after the operation, `y` is now `lit[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` and `b` are either empty lists or contain elements from `lit` where each element in `a` is less than or equal to `x` and each element in `b` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`; `cp` remains 0; `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `lit[i]`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
