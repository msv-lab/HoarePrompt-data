The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the current element `lit[i]` to the list `a`. This action modifies the list `a` by adding a new element to it. If `a` was previously empty, it will no longer be empty after this operation. The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `b`, `cp`, `y`, `s`, `x`, and the conditions involving `lit[i]`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is not an empty list (it now contains the element `lit[i]`); `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `cp` is 0; `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was empty before the operation, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`, which is now `lit[i]`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`; `y` is less than `lit[i]`; the current value of `lit[i]` satisfies `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`.**
