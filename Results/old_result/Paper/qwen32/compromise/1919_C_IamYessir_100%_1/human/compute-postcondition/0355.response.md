To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given information step by step.

**Initial State:**
- `s` is the total number of times an element in list `b` is greater than the preceding element.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `cp` remains 0.

**What needs to be printed:**
- The value of `s`.

**Analysis:**
- The variable `s` is defined as the total number of times an element in list `b` is greater than the preceding element. However, the list `b` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `s`.
- The description of `s` gives us the formula or condition to calculate its value if `b` were known.
- Since the list `b` is not provided, we can only describe `s` using the given information.

**Conclusion:**
The `print(s)` statement will output the value of `s`, which is the count of times an element in list `b` is greater than the preceding element.

Output: **s (where s is the total number of times an element in list `b` is greater than the preceding element)**
