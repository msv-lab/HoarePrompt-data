The code snippet provided is `a.append(lit[i])`, which appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is 4, the element at index 4 of `lit` is appended to `a`. 

Since `a` could be either an empty list or not empty initially, and `lit` is a predefined list of integers, the list `a` will now include the element `lit[4]` as its last element. However, the values of `s`, `n`, `b`, `cp`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged by this operation, as the code snippet only modifies `a`.

Output State: **`s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element (potentially increased by 1), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string, `a` includes `lit[4]` as its last element, and if `x < lit[i]`, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element, updating `x` to `lit[i]`. `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and if `lit[i] > y`, `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element, updating `y` to `lit[i]` and incrementing `s` by 1 if `lit[i] > x` and `lit[i] > y`. `cp` is 0, `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is updated based on the conditions described. If `b` was initially empty, `y` is `float('inf')`; otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. `i` is 4.**
