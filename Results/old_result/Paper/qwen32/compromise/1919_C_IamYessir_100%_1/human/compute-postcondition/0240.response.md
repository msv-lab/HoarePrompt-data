The code snippet only assigns the value 0 to the variable `cp`. None of the other variables (`s`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `b`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `n` is an input integer; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string; `a` is an empty list; `b` is an empty list; `cp` is 0.**
