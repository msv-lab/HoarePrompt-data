The code snippet appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. This means that the list `a` will now include the new element `lit[i]` at the end. The other variables remain unchanged in terms of their conditions and values unless directly affected by this operation.

Given the initial state and the code, the updated state of the variables is as follows:

- `a` is no longer an empty list (if it was) and now includes the element `lit[i]`.
- `s`, `n`, `lit`, `b`, `cp`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged in terms of their conditions and values.

Output State: **`s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string; `a` is not an empty list and includes `lit[i]` as its last element; `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `cp` is 0; if `a` was an empty list, `x` was `float('inf')`; otherwise, `x` was the last element of `a`; if `b` is an empty list, `y` is `float('inf')`; otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`; `x` is less than `y` and this condition is true; `x` is less than `lit[i]`; `lit[i]` is greater than `y`.**
