The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. This means that the list `b` will now have one more element, which is `lit[i]`.

Given the initial state, the variable `b` could either be an empty list or not. Regardless of its initial state, after the operation, `b` will definitely not be empty because an element is being added to it. The variable `y` is updated to the last element of `b`, which is `lit[i]` after the append operation.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `cp`, `x`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is not an empty list and its last element is `lit[i]`; `cp` is 0; `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` is an empty list, or the last element of `a` if `a` is not an empty list; `x` is greater than `y`; and `y` is `lit[i]`.**
