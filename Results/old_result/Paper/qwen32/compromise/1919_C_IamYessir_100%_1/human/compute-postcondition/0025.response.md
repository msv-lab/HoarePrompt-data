Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list that includes `lit[i]` if `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged; `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `cp` is 0; `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` was empty before and `lit[i]` is not the last element of `a` after the append, or the last element of `a` after the append; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is an empty list, or the last element of `b` if `b` is not an empty list; `y` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`.**
