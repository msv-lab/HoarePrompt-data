Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list containing the previous elements of `a` plus `lit[i]` if `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged; `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and contains elements `lit[i]` based on the condition `lit[i] <= x` if `x > y`, otherwise `y >= lit[i] > x`; `cp` is 0; `x` is the last element of `a` if `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`, otherwise `x` remains unchanged; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `i` is `i` (unchanged).***
