Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and `lit[i]` has been appended to `b`; `cp` is 0; `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` is an empty list, or the last element of `a` if `a` is not an empty list; `y` is the last element of `b` (which is `lit[i]`); `lit[i]` is greater than `x`; and `y` is less than `lit[i]` is no longer valid since `y` is now equal to `lit[i]`.**

In simpler terms: The list `b` now includes the element `lit[i]`. The value of `y` has been updated to `lit[i]`. All other conditions remain the same except that `y` is no longer less than `lit[i]` because they are now equal.
