Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, now with `lit[i]` appended; `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `cp` is 0; `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` was an empty list before appending, or the last element of `a` (which is now `lit[i]`); `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is an empty list, or the last element of `b`; `x` is less than `y` and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`.**

In simpler terms, the list `a` now includes the element `lit[i]` at the end. The value of `x` is updated to be the last element of `a`, which is now `lit[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
