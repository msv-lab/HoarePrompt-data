The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. 

Given the initial state, the only change is that the list `b` now includes an additional element, specifically `lit[i]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and contains elements `lit[i]` based on the condition `lit[i] > x` if `x > y`, otherwise `lit[i] > y`; `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and contains elements `lit[i]` based on the condition `lit[i] <= x` if `x > y`, otherwise `y >= lit[i] > x`, and now includes `lit[i]`; `cp` is 0; `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, or the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `i` is `i + 1`.**
