The value of `y` is updated to `float('inf')`. No other variables are affected by this single line of code.

Output State: **`s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element (potentially increased by 1), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string, `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and if `x < lit[i]`, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element, updating `x` to `lit[i]`, `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and if `lit[i] > y`, `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element, updating `y` to `lit[i]` and incrementing `s` by 1 if `lit[i] > x` and `lit[i] > y`, `cp` is 0, `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is updated based on the conditions described, `y` is `float('inf')`, and `i` is 4.**
