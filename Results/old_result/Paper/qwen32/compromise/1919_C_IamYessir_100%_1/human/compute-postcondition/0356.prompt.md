Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    lit = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a, b = [], []
    cp = 0
    for i in range(0, n):
        if len(a) == 0:
            x = float('inf')
        else:
            x = a[-1]
        if len(b) == 0:
            y = float('inf')
        else:
            y = b[-1]
        if x > y:
            if y >= lit[i]:
                b.append(lit[i])
            elif lit[i] > x:
                b.append(lit[i])
            elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
                a.append(lit[i])
        elif x == y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif x < y:
            if x >= lit[i]:
                a.append(lit[i])
            elif lit[i] > y:
                a.append(lit[i])
            elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
                b.append(lit[i])
    s = 0
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] > a[i - 1]:
            s += 1
    for i in range(1, len(b)):
        if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
            s += 1
    print(s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in `lit`; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers; `cp` is 0; `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is the total number of times an element in list `b` is greater than the preceding element; `a` remains unchanged; `cp` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
