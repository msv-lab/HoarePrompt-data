The code snippet `s += 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. The initial state mentions that `b` is a list with at least `i + 1` elements and that `i` is `i + 1`. However, the variable `s` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we can assume it has some initial value that we'll denote as `s_initial`. After the code execution, `s` will be `s_initial + 1`. The other variables (`b` and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`b` is a list that must have at least `i + 1` elements, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` is `s_initial + 1`.**
