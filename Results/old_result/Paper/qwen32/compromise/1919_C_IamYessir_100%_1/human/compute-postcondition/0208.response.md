Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` and `b` are lists containing elements `lit[i]` based on the conditions `lit[i] > x` if `x > y`, otherwise `lit[i] > y` for `a`, and `lit[i] <= x` if `x > y`, otherwise `y >= lit[i] > x` for `b`; `cp` is 0; `x` is `lit[i]` if `lit[i] < x`, otherwise `x` remains unchanged; `y` is `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > x` and `y >= lit[i]`, otherwise `y` remains unchanged; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `i` is `i + 1`. If `x < y`, `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i] < x`, and `y` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > x` and `y >= lit[i]`. If `lit[i] > y`, `a` includes `lit[i]`. If `y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x`, `b` includes `lit[i]`. If `x >= y`, no changes are made to `x` and `y`.**
