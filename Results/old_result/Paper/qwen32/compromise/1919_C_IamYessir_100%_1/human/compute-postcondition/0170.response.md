The code snippet `y = b[-1]` updates the variable `y` to the last element of the list `b`. 

Given the initial state, `b` is either an empty list or contains elements based on certain conditions. If `b` is not empty, `y` is updated to the last element of `b`. If `b` is empty, the value of `y` remains unchanged because the code does not handle the case where `b` is empty. However, based on the provided code snippet, we assume `b` is not empty, as the operation `b[-1]` would raise an `IndexError` if `b` were empty.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `cp`, `x`, `s`, `i`) remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and contains elements `lit[i]` based on the condition `lit[i] > x` if `x > y`, otherwise `lit[i] > y`; `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and contains elements `lit[i]` based on the condition `lit[i] <= x` if `x > y`, otherwise `y >= lit[i] > x`; `cp` is 0; `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, or the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty; `y` is the last element of `b`; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `i` is `i + 1`.**
