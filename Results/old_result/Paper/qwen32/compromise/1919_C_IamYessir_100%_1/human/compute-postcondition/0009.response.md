The code assigns the last element of list `a` to the variable `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is not an empty list; `b` is an empty list; `cp` is 0; `x` is the last element of `a`.**
