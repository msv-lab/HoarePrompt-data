The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `b`. This changes the list `b` by adding a new element to it. If `b` was empty before, it will no longer be empty. If `b` was not empty, it will now have one more element.

The value of `s` (the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element) might change if the newly appended element `lit[i]` is greater than the last element of the previous `b`. However, since the problem statement does not provide the current state of `b` or `lit[i]` relative to the last element of `b`, we can't definitively say how `s` will change. Thus, we can only state that `s` may increase by 1 if the condition is met, but we don't specify the exact new value of `s`.

The other variables (`n`, `lit`, `a`, `cp`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element (potentially increased by 1), `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string, `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, `b` is not an empty list and includes `lit[i]` as its last element, `cp` is 0, if `a` is an empty list, `x` is `float('inf')`; otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`; if `b` had only one element before, `y` is now the last element of `b` (which is `lit[i]`); otherwise, `y` remains the last element of the previous `b`; `x` is less than `y`; `lit[i]` is greater than `x` and not greater than `y`.**
