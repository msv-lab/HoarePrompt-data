Postcondition: **`s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element (potentially increased by 1). `n` is an input integer greater than 0. `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string. `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and if `x < lit[i]`, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element, updating `x` to `lit[i]`. `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and if `lit[i] > y`, `b` remains unchanged; if `y >= lit[i] > x`, `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element, updating `y` to `lit[i]`. If `x >= lit[i]`, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element, and `x` remains `lit[i]`. `x` is less than `y` and this condition is true.**
