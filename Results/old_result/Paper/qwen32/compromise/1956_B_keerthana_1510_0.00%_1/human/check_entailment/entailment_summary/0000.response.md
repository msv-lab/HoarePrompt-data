Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program calculates the sum of the integer divisions of the count of each unique element in the list by 3, which does not align with the game rules or the objective of the problem. 

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally, considering that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. The strategy involves analyzing the distribution of cards and making optimal choices based on the game rules.

The program's approach of counting elements and dividing by 3 does not reflect any logical strategy for the game described. It seems to be a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
