The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of cards each player receives, and a list of integers `a` of length `n` where each integer `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) represents the integers on the cards in your hand. The integer `n` appears at most twice in the list `a`. The function returns a value based on the conditions described:
- Case_1: If the integer `n` appears exactly once in the list `a`, the function returns "Win".
- Case_2: If the integer `n` appears exactly twice in the list `a`, the function returns "Lose".
- Case_3: If the integer `n` does not appear in the list `a`, the function returns "Draw".

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. It returns "Win" if `n` appears exactly once in the list, "Lose" if `n` appears exactly twice, and "Draw" if `n` does not appear in the list.**
