The code snippet provided calculates the minimum of the first two integers in the list `lst` and adds this value to the variable `ans`. Here are the specific impacts on the variables:

- `ans` will be updated to its previous value plus the minimum of the first two integers in `lst`.
- Other variables (`t`, `ans_f`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `lst`) remain unchanged unless `lst` was modified before this line, which is not shown in the provided code snippet.

Since the exact values of `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` are not provided, we can only express the new value of `ans` in terms of these elements.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `ans_f` is an empty list; `i` is 1; `ans` is the sum of its previous value and the minimum of the first two integers in `lst`; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `l` is an input string; `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` at each space. If the length of `lst` is not 2, the first element and the element at index 2 are removed from `lst`, causing a shift in the subsequent elements. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, no elements are removed from `lst`.**
