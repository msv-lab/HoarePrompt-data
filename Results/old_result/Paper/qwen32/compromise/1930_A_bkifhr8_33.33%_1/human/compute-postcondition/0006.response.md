The code snippet `lst = l.split(' ')` splits the input string `l` into a list of substrings wherever there is a space. This operation creates a new variable `lst` and does not affect the other variables directly.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 5000; `ans_f` is an empty list; `i` is not yet initialized; `ans` is 0; `n` is an input integer; `l` is an input string; `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` at each space.**
