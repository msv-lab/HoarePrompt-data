Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans_f` is a list containing the final value of `ans` plus the current value of `ans`; `i` is the number of iterations the loop completed plus 1; `ans` is 0; `n` is the newly input integer; `l` is the newly input string; `lst` is either empty or contains exactly two elements.**

Natural Language: The value of `n` is now the newly input integer. All other variables retain their previous values.
