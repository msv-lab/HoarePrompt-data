Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; `ans_f` is a list containing the final value of `ans` plus the current value of `ans`; `i` is the number of iterations the loop completed plus 3; `ans` is updated by adding the minimum of the integer values of the first two elements of `lst`; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is the newly input string; `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces, with the first element removed and the third element removed if the length of `lst` is not 2. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is updated, and the most internal loop is broken out of. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
