Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, and the precondition for the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) is still valid; `ans_f` is an empty list.**

This means that the variable `t` retains its value as an input integer within the specified range, and a new variable `ans_f` has been initialized as an empty list.
