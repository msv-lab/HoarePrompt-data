The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. The variables `t`, `ans_f`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is that `t` is still an input integer representing the number of test cases, `ans_f` is still an empty list, `i` is still not initialized, `ans` is still 0, and `n` is now an input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 5000; `ans_f` is an empty list; `i` is not yet initialized; `ans` is 0; `n` is an input integer.**
