Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `ans_f` is an empty list; `i` is 2; `ans` is the sum of its previous value and the minimum of the first two integers in `lst`; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `l` is an input string; `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` at each space. If the original length of `lst` was not 2, the first element and the element at index 2 are removed from `lst`, reducing its length by 3. If the original length of `lst` was exactly 2, no elements are removed from `lst`.**
