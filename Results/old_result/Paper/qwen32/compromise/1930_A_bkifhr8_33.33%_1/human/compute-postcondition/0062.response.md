The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the number of iterations that have completed, and `t` is the total number of test cases that need to be processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `t` remains the same since it represents the total number of iterations the loop should perform.

Here's the step-by-step adjustment:
- `i` at the end of the previous iteration is the current number of completed iterations. At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.
- `t` remains unchanged as it is the total number of test cases.

Other variables like `ans_f`, `ans`, `n`, `l`, and `lst` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head criteria.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans_f` is a list containing the final value of `ans` plus the current value of `ans`; `i` is the number of iterations the loop completed plus 1; `ans` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of elements processed; `n` is the newly input integer; `l` is the newly input string; `lst` is either empty or contains exactly two elements.**
