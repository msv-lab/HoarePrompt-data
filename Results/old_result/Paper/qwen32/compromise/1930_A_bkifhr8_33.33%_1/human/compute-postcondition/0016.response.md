The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not yet initialized in the state description, but we can infer that `i` was used in the loop, and it would have been incremented by 1 after the previous iteration.

Given that the loop runs for `n * 2` iterations, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Since `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the state description at the end of the previous iteration, we can assume that at the start of the first iteration, `i` would be 0. Therefore, for subsequent iterations, `i` would be incremented by 1.

Let's assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration. Then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

However, since `i` is not initialized in the state description, we can start by initializing it to 0 for the first iteration and then incrementing it by 1 for each subsequent iteration.

For the first iteration, `i` would be 0. For the second iteration, `i` would be 1, and so on.

Given that we are asked to describe the state at the start of the next iteration, and assuming the previous iteration ended with `i` being some value `x`, the next value of `i` would be `x + 1`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize that `i` should be incremented by 1.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `x`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

Since we do not have the exact value of `x`, we can describe the state in a general form, incrementing `i` by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `ans_f` is an empty list; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `ans` is the sum of its previous value and the minimum of the first two integers in `lst`; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `l` is an input string; `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` at each space. If the length of `lst` is not 2, the first element and the element at index 2 are removed from `lst`, causing a shift in the subsequent elements. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, no elements are removed from `lst`.**

For the first iteration, we can assume `i` starts at 0:

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `ans_f` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `ans` is the sum of its previous value and the minimum of the first two integers in `lst`; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `l` is an input string; `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` at each space. If the length of `lst` is not 2, the first element and the element at index 2 are removed from `lst`, causing a shift in the subsequent elements. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, no elements are removed from `lst`.**

For subsequent iterations, `i` would be incremented by 1:

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `ans_f` is an empty list; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `ans` is the sum of its previous value and the minimum of the first two integers in `lst`; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `l` is an input string; `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` at each space. If the length of `lst` is not 2, the first element and the element at index 2 are removed from `lst`, causing a shift in the subsequent elements. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, no elements are removed from `lst`.**

For the sake of providing a concrete example, let's assume `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration. Then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1:

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `ans_f` is an empty list; `i` is 1; `ans` is the sum of its previous value and the minimum of the first two integers in `lst`; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `l` is an input string; `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` at each space. If the length of `lst` is not 2, the first element and the element at index 2 are removed from `lst`, causing a shift in the subsequent elements. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, no elements are removed from `lst`.**
