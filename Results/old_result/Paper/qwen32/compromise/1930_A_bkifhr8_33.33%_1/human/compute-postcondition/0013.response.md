The code snippet adds the minimum of the two integers obtained by splitting the string `l` at each space to the variable `ans`. The variables `t`, `ans_f`, `i`, `n`, `l`, and `lst` remain unchanged in terms of their conditions and values. The only change is the updated value of `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `ans_f` is an empty list; `i` is not yet initialized; `ans` is the sum of its previous value and the minimum of the two integers in `lst`; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `l` is an input string; `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` at each space; the length of `lst` is exactly 2.**
