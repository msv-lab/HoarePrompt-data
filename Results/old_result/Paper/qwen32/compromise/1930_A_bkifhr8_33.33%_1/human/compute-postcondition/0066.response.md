The code snippet `lst = l.split(' ')` splits the string `l` into a list of substrings based on spaces. This means that `lst` will now contain the words from the string `l` as its elements.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans_f` is a list containing the final value of `ans` plus the current value of `ans`; `i` is the number of iterations the loop completed plus 1; `ans` is 0; `n` is the newly input integer; `l` is the newly input string; `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces.**
