The code snippet `ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` adds the minimum of the integer values of the first two elements of the list `lst` to the variable `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`.
- `i` is 0.
- `ans` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `l` is the newly input string.
- `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces, and the length of `lst` is not equal to 2.

After executing the code snippet:
- The value of `ans` is updated to `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`; `i` is 0; `ans` is `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`; `n` must be greater than 0; `l` is the newly input string; `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces, and the length of `lst` is not equal to 2.**
