You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = l.split(' ')
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the minimum values of pairs of integers from the list until only two or fewer integers remain. The function outputs the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We are given 2n integers.
- We perform n moves where each move involves selecting two integers, adding the smaller one to the score, and removing both integers.
- We need to maximize the final score after n moves.

### Key Strategy:
To maximize the score, we should always pair the smallest available numbers together. This is because adding the smaller number of each pair to the score will yield the highest possible score.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of 2n integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0 for each test case.
   - It reads the list of integers as a string and splits it into a list of strings `lst`.
   - The program then enters a loop intended to perform n moves.

3. **Performing Moves:**
   - The loop iterates `n * 2` times, but this is incorrect. It should iterate `n` times because each iteration represents one move, and each move removes two numbers.
   - Inside the loop, the program attempts to add the minimum of the first two elements in `lst` to `ans` and then remove these elements.
   - However, the removal logic is incorrect: `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` are incorrect because `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` are always 0 and 2, respectively, and do not correctly index the smallest elements.
   - The `else` block is unnecessary and incorrectly assumes that the list will only contain two elements after the first iteration.

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly collects the results for each test case in `ans_f` and prints them at the end.

### Correctness:
The program does not correctly implement the strategy of always pairing and adding the smallest available numbers. The logic for selecting and removing the smallest numbers is flawed, and the loop structure is incorrect. As a result, the program does not necessarily produce the maximum score.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program needs to be corrected to properly sort the list of numbers and always select the smallest available numbers for each move.
