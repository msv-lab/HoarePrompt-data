### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its logic in the context of the problem statement and the execution summary.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Logic for Calculating the Score**:
   - The program initializes the score `ans` to 0.
   - It then iterates `n` times (not `n*2` times as suggested by the loop range, which is a mistake) to pick pairs of numbers, compute their minimum, and add it to the score.
   - The program attempts to remove the pairs from the list `lst` after processing them.

3. **Issues in the Code**:
   - The loop condition `for i in range(n * 2):` is incorrect. The loop should run `n` times because we need to pick `n` pairs.
   - The logic for removing elements from the list is flawed. The indices used in `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` are incorrect and will lead to errors or incorrect behavior. Instead, it should remove the first two elements in the list after processing them.
   - The `else` block inside the loop is unnecessary and will cause an error when the list has more than two elements.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The optimal strategy to maximize the score is to sort the list and always pick the smallest two numbers available, which is what the current approach attempts to do.
   - However, the implementation has several issues that need to be fixed to achieve the correct behavior.

### Correctness:

Due to the issues mentioned above, the current implementation is incorrect. The loop should iterate `n` times, and the elements should be removed correctly from the list.

**Correctness: False**

To make the program correct, the loop should be adjusted to run `n` times, and the elements should be removed properly. Here is a corrected version of the loop:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()
        for j in range(n):
            ans += lst[2 * j]  # Since the list is sorted, we can directly pick the minimum of each pair
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
```

This corrected version sorts the list and directly adds the first element of each pair to the score, which is the optimal strategy.
