Postcondition: **`in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m + 1:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[1:n - m]`. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and if `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `C[in_aa]` equals `D[in_aa]`, then `C[in_aa]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1.**
