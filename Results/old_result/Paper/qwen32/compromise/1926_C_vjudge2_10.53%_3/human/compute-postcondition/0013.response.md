Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each of the following `t` lines, it receives an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the largest number Vladislav writes for that test case. The function returns the functionality based on the provided `n` for each test case.**
