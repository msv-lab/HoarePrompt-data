Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - Then, it reads `t` integers, each representing the value of `n` for a particular test case.
   - It stores these values in the list `numbers`.

2. **Precomputation:**
   - The program initializes two lists: `values` and `sum_values`. 
     - `values[i]` will store the sum of the digits of the number `i`.
     - `sum_values[i]` will store the cumulative sum of `values[j]` for `j` from 1 to `i`.
   - It initializes these lists up to the maximum value of `n` across all test cases.

3. **Base Case Initialization:**
   - For numbers from 0 to 9, the sum of their digits is the number itself.
   - It also calculates the cumulative sum for these base cases.

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - For numbers from 10 to `n`, it calculates the sum of digits using previously computed values.
   - For a number `i`, it splits it into its last digit (`last`) and the remaining part (`remainder`).
   - The sum of digits of `i` is then `values[last] + values[remainder]`.
   - It updates the cumulative sum accordingly.

5. **Output:**
   - For each test case, it prints the cumulative sum of digit sums for the corresponding `n`.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Variable Scope Error:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined after it is called (`func_1()` at the beginning of the script). This will result in a `NameError` because the function is not defined at the time it is called.

2. **Loop Range Error:**
   - The loop `for i in range(10, n + 1):` is incorrect because `n` is not defined in this context. It should iterate up to `max(numbers) + 1` to cover all possible values of `n` in the test cases.

3. **Output Calculation Error:**
   - The program calculates cumulative sums up to the maximum `n` across all test cases. However, it should calculate the cumulative sums up to each individual `n` for each test case to ensure correctness.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned above, the program as written is incorrect. The variable scope error will cause the program to fail at runtime, and the loop range and output calculation errors will lead to incorrect results.

**Correctness: False**

To fix the program, the function definition should be moved before its call, the loop should iterate up to `max(numbers) + 1`, and the cumulative sums should be recalculated for each individual `n` in the test cases.
