Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

# Annotated Program:
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the largest number Vladislav writes for that test case.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        numbers.append(n)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each corresponding to the input integer provided in each iteration of the loop.
    values = [(0) for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]

    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        
        total += i
        
        sum_values[i] = total
        
    #State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each corresponding to the input integer provided in each iteration of the loop; `values` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]; `sum_values` is [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]; `total` is 45.
    for i in range(10, n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
        
    #State: t is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); numbers is a list containing t integers, each corresponding to the input integer provided in each iteration of the loop; values is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 2]; sum_values is [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 46, 48, 51, 55, 60, 66, 73, 81, 90, 100, 102]; total is 45.
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])
        
    #State: The loop prints values from `sum_values` based on indices in `numbers`; `t`, `numbers`, `values`, `sum_values`, and `total` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` integers `n` (each between 1 and 2 · 10^5). For each `n`, it calculates and prints a value based on a predefined sequence logic. The final state of the program is that it outputs the calculated values for each test case without modifying the input values.
