Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters. It then processes each string to determine if it can be rearranged to form a different string. If the string can be rearranged, it prints 'Yes' followed by one possible rearrangement; otherwise, it prints 'No'.**
