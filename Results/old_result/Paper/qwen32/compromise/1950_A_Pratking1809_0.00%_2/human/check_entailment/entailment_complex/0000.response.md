### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to handle the problem as described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and why it should be correct:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `q` (which is `t` in the problem statement).
   - For each of these `q` test cases, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - For each test case, the program checks if the values `a`, `b`, and `c` form a "STAIR" (`a < b < c`).
   - If the first condition is not met, it then checks if the values form a "PEAK" (`a < b > c`).
   - If neither of these conditions is met, it prints "NONE".

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the conditions checked for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic for determining if the values form a "STAIR" or "PEAK" is correct and straightforward.
- The use of `if` and `else` statements ensures that only one of the three possible outputs ("STAIR", "PEAK", "NONE") is printed for each test case.
- The program correctly handles the constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 and 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9).

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- For the input `1 2 3`, the program checks `1 < 2 < 3` which is true, so it prints "STAIR".
- For the input `3 2 1`, neither `3 < 2 < 1` nor `3 < 2 > 1` is true, so it prints "NONE".
- For the input `1 5 3`, the program checks `1 < 5 > 3` which is true, so it prints "PEAK".
- For the input `3 4 1`, the program checks `3 < 4 > 1` which is true, so it prints "PEAK".
- For the input `0 0 0`, neither `0 < 0 < 0` nor `0 < 0 > 0` is true, so it prints "NONE".
- For the input `4 1 7`, neither `4 < 1 < 7` nor `4 < 1 > 7` is true, so it prints "NONE".
- For the input `4 5 7`, the program checks `4 < 5 < 7` which is true, so it prints "STAIR".

The output matches the expected results, confirming the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if the given digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or neither.

**Correctness: True**
