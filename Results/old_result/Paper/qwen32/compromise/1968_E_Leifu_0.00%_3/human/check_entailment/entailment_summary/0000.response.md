### Reasoning:

The program is supposed to output a set of `n` points on an `n x n` grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of points is maximized. The program's logic for generating these points is as follows:

1. For any test case, it starts by printing the points `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`.
2. If `n` is 3, it adds the point `(2, 3)`.
3. For `n` greater than 3, it adds the point `(2, 4)` and then prints points `(j, j)` for `j` ranging from 4 to `n`.

Let's analyze if this strategy can indeed maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances:

- **Base Points:**
  - For `n = 2`, the points `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` are chosen. The only Manhattan distance is `1`.
  - For `n = 3`, the points `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(2, 3)` are chosen. The Manhattan distances are `1`, `2`, and `3`.
  - For `n > 3`, the points `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and `(j, j)` for `j` from `4` to `n` are chosen.

- **Analysis for `n > 3`:**
  - The points `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` already provide distances of `0` and `1`.
  - The point `(2, 4)` introduces additional distances, such as `2` (from `(1, 1)`), `3` (from `(1, 2)`), and `3` (from `(2, 4)` to `(1, 1)`).
  - The points `(j, j)` for `j` from `4` to `n` introduce further distances. The distance between `(j, j)` and `(1, 1)` is `2*j - 2`, and between `(j, j)` and `(1, 2)` is `2*j - 3`. These distances are distinct for different `j`.

However, the provided program does not ensure the maximum set of distinct Manhattan distances for all `n`. For example, for `n = 4`, the optimal points might be `(1, 1)`, `(1, 3)`, `(4, 3)`, and `(4, 4)`, which provide more distinct distances compared to the points chosen by the program.

### Conclusion:
The program does not guarantee the maximum set of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of `n`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
