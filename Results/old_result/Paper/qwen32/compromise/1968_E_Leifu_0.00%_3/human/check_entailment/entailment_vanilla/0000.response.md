Let's analyze the given Python program against the problem description step by step.

### Problem Understanding:
The goal is to maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances between n points in an n x n grid. The Manhattan distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is defined as |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|. The program must output n points for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n`.

2. **Output Strategy:**
   - For every test case, it prints the first point as (1, 1).
   - It prints the second point as (1, 2).
   - For `n = 3`, it prints the third point as (2, 3).
   - For `n > 3`, it prints the third point as (2, 4) and then prints points (j, j) for `j` from 4 to `n`.

### Correctness Assessment:
Let's verify if this strategy can maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances:

- **For n = 2:**
  - Points: (1, 1), (1, 2)
  - Distances: |1-1|+|1-1| = 0, |1-1|+|2-2| = 0, |1-1|+|1-2| = 1
  - Unique distances: {0, 1}
  - This is correct and maximizes the distinct distances for n = 2.

- **For n = 3:**
  - Points: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)
  - Distances: |1-1|+|1-1| = 0, |1-1|+|2-2| = 0, |1-1|+|1-2| = 1, |1-2|+|1-3| = 3, |1-2|+|1-2| = 0, |2-2|+|3-3| = 0, |2-3|+|1-2| = 2, |2-3|+|1-3| = 1
  - Unique distances: {0, 1, 2, 3}
  - This is correct and maximizes the distinct distances for n = 3.

- **For n > 3:**
  - The program places points (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4) and then (j, j) for `j` from 4 to `n`.
  - The points (1, 1), (1, 2) and (2, 4) will generate several distances, including 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
  - The points (j, j) will generate additional distances as they move diagonally.
  - However, this strategy does not guarantee the maximum number of unique distances for all n > 3.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the cases for n = 2 and n = 3 but does not provide a strategy that maximizes the set of distinct Manhattan distances for n > 3. For larger n, a different strategy is required to ensure that the maximum number of unique distances is achieved.

Therefore, the correctness of the program based on the provided strategy is:

Correctness: **False**
