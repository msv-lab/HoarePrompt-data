Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of \(n\). The program only handles the cases for \(n = 2\) and \(n = 3\) correctly, and then it follows a pattern that does not ensure the maximum number of distinct distances for \(n \geq 4\).

For \(n \geq 4\), the program places points in a way that does not utilize the grid space optimally to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances. Specifically, placing points along the diagonal and in a few specific positions does not yield the maximum possible set of distinct Manhattan distances for larger grids.

To maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances, a more strategic placement of points is required, such as placing them in a way that covers a wider range of distances. The given program does not achieve this for all \(n\).
