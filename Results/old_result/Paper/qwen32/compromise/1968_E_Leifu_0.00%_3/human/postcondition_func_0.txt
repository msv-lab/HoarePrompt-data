The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the size of an n x n grid. It then prints specific pairs of numbers based on the value of `n`. For each test case, it prints "1 1", "1 2", and either "2 3" if `n` is 3, or "2 4" followed by pairs "j j" for `j` ranging from 4 to `n`.
