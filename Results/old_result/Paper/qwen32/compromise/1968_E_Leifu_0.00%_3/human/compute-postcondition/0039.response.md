The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop iterates from 4 to `n` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `j` would have taken the value of `n` (since the loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` would need to be incremented by 1 and `n` must be at least one greater than the current `j`.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration `n` must be at least 4 and `j` must have been `n` (since it's the last iteration with `j` equal to `n`), for the next iteration `j` should be `n + 1` and `n` should be at least `n + 1`.

State: **`n` must be at least 5, `j` is 5**
