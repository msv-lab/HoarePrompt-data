You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) representing the size of the n x n grid for each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        print('1 1')
        
        print('1 2')
        
        if n == 3:
            print('2 3')
        else:
            print('2 4')
            for j in range(4, n + 1):
                print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
        
    #State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 50; the loop has executed `t` times; for each test case, the program prints "1 1", "1 2", and if `n` is 3, it prints "2 3", otherwise it prints "2 4" followed by lines from "4 4" to "n n" where each line contains the same number printed twice, separated by a space. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged after all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) representing the size of an n x n grid. The function processes these inputs and returns some output for each test case, though the specific output is not detailed here.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
