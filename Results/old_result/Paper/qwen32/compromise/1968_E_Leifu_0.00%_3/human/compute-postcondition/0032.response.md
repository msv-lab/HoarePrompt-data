The code snippet `n = int(input())` changes the value of `n` to whatever integer is input by the user. The other variables (`t`, `i`, and `j` if it was set) remain unchanged unless `n` takes a specific value that affects their conditions. Since the initial state specifies that if `n` is equal to 3, the state remains unchanged, this condition would be checked after the input is taken. However, the code snippet provided does not include this conditional logic, so we only consider the direct impact of the input on `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 50; `n` is the input integer; `i` is `k+2`. If `n` is equal to 3, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `j` is set to `n + 1`.**
