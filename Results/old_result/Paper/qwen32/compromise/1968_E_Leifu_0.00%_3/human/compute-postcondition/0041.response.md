The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop iterates as long as `j` is in the range from 4 to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 5. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 6, and `n` must be at least 6 to include 6 in the range.

State: **`n` must be at least 6, `j` is 6**
