Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is the integer value of the user's input, `prev` is 0, `kp` is incremented by 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or `0` if no `'<'` was received), `v2` is `n-1`.**

In this output state, the value of `prev` has been set to 0, while the values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `kp`, `g`, `v1`, and `v2`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
