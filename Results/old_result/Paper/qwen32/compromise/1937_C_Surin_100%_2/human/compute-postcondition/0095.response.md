The code snippet provided is:

```
sys.stdout.flush()
```

This line of code flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console immediately. However, it does not modify or affect any of the variables in the given initial state.

Thus, the variables `t`, `n`, `g`, `prev`, `kp`, `v2`, `r`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `prev` is the last `i` for which `r` was `'>'` or `r` was `'='` and `r2` was `'<'`, `kp` is incremented by 1, `v2` is `i`, `r` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 2`**
