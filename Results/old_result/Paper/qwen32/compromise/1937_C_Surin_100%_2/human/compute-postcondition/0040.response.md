The code snippet provided is `r2 = input('')`, which means the variable `r2` is assigned the value of the user's next input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `prev`, and `r`) are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the input `r` was `<`. If no `r` was `<`, `v1` is 0, `prev` is 0, `r` is equal to `'='`, and `r2` is the user's next input.**
