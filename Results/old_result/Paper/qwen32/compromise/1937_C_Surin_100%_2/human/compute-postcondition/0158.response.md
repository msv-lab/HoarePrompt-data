To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement.

Initial State:
- `i` is `i+1`: This statement suggests that `i` is being incremented by 1. However, `i` is not defined before this statement, so we can infer that `i` must have been defined previously with some value, and then it is incremented by 1.
- `v2` is `i+1`: After `i` is incremented, `v2` is assigned the value of `i+1`. Since `i` was just incremented, `v2` will be `i+1` after the increment, which means `v2` is effectively `i+2` relative to the original value of `i`.

The print statement:
```
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `v2` is `i+2` relative to the original value of `i`.
- `v1` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we don't have an explicit value for `v1`. We can only assume `v1` is defined somewhere in the code before this print statement.

Given the information, we can describe the output as follows:
- The first `{v1}` and the second `{v1}` in the print statement will print the value of `v1`.
- The first `{v2}` and the second `{v2}` in the print statement will print the value of `v2`, which is `i+2` relative to the original value of `i`.

Since the exact value of `v1` and the original value of `i` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2] (where v2 is i+2 relative to the original value of i)**
