To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state and identify the values of the variables `v1`, `i`, `prev`, and how they are used in the print statement.

### Variables and Conditions:
1. **`v1`**: This variable holds the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or `0` if no `'<'` was received).
2. **`i`**: This variable is incremented by 1.
3. **`prev`**: This variable is set according to certain conditions, but the exact value is not specified in the initial state.
4. **`v2`**: This variable is set to `n-1`, but it is not used in the print statement.
5. **`t`**, **`n`**, **`kp`**, **`g`**, **`r`**, **`r2`**: These variables are mentioned but do not affect the print statement directly.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will output a formatted string starting with a question mark `'?'`, followed by the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1` again, and `prev`.
- `v1` appears twice in the output string, so it will be printed twice.
- The exact value of `v1` depends on whether the input was `'<'` at any point. If it was, `v1` will be the last `i` value for which the input was `'<'`. If not, `v1` will be `0`.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1 before the print statement, so it will reflect the incremented value.
- The value of `prev` is set according to some conditions, but its exact value is not provided in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
Given the information, we can describe the output as:
- The first `v1` is the last `i` value for which the input was `'<'` (or `0` if no `'<'` was received).
- The second `v1` is the same as the first `v1`.
- `i` is the incremented value of `i`.
- `prev` is set according to some conditions, but its exact value is not specified.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev] (where [v1] is the last value of i for which the input was '<' or 0 if no '<' was received, [i] is the incremented value of i, and [prev] is set according to the conditions)**
