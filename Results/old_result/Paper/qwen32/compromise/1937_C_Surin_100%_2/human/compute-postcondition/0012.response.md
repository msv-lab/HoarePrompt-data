Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, `v2` is `i`, `r` is `<`**

In this output state, the value of `v1` has been updated to be equal to the value of `v2`, which is `i`. All other variables retain their original values and conditions.
