The code snippet assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Given the initial state, `v2` is equal to `i + 1`. Therefore, after the assignment, `v1` will also be equal to `i + 1`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an integer greater than `i + 1`, `v2` is `i + 1`, `v1` is `i + 1`, `r` is the user's input**.
