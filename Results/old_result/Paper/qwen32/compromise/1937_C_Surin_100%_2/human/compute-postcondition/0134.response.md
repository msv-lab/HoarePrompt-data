Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state provided.

### Initial State:
- `t` is some value (the exact value is not provided).
- `n` is greater than 1 (the exact value is not provided).
- `r` is the value provided by the user (the exact value is not provided).
- `i` is incremented by 1 (the exact initial value of `i` is not provided, but we know it is incremented by 1 before the print statement).
- `prev` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value from the given information.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is incremented by 1 before the print statement, so the value printed for `i` will be the incremented value.
- The variable `prev` is used twice in the print statement, but its value is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe it as `prev` without knowing its exact value.

### Output:
The output will be a formatted string with the following components:
- A question mark `?`
- The value of `i` (which is incremented by 1)
- The value of `i` again (same as the previous one)
- The value of `prev` (unknown, so we describe it as `prev`)
- The value of `prev` again (same as the previous one)

### Final Output:
Output: **? [incremented_i] [incremented_i] prev prev (where incremented_i is the value of i after it has been incremented by 1 and prev is the value provided by the user or defined elsewhere in the code)**
