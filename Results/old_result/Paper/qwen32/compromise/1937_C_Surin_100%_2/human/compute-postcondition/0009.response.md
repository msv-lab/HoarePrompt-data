The code provided is `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the internal buffer for the standard output. This action does not change the values of any variables in the program. Therefore, the variables `t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is `i`**.
