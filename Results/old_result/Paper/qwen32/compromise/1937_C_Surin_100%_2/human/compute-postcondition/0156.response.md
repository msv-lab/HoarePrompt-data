The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, `n` is an integer value greater than 1, and `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

Given that `kp` is incremented by 1 and `v1` is set to `i` at the end of each iteration, these values do not directly affect the loop condition. The state of `t`, `prev`, `g`, and `v2` remains unchanged in the context of the loop head.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` has taken on a value that is one less than the value it will have at the start of the next iteration. Since `i` ranges from 1 to `n-1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is an integer value greater than 1, `prev` is the value determined by the user's inputs throughout the `n-1` iterations of the loop, `kp` is incremented by 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i+1`, and `v2` is `i+1` if `r` equals `'<'`. Otherwise, `v2` remains `i+1` and other variables retain their original values, `i` is `i+1`**.

However, since only the loop head variables can be adjusted, the final state considering only `i` is:

State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is an integer value greater than 1, `prev` is the value determined by the user's inputs throughout the `n-1` iterations of the loop, `kp` is incremented by 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, and `v2` is `i` if `r` equals `'<'`. Otherwise, `v2` remains `i` and other variables retain their original values, `i` is `i+1`**.

Since the task specifies adjusting only the loop head variables, the final state is:

State: **`i` is `i+1`**.
