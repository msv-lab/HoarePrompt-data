Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i` if `r` equals `'<'`, otherwise `v1` remains 0, `prev` is the last `i` for which `r` was `'>'` or `r` was `'='` and `r2` was `'<'`, `kp` is incremented by 1, `v2` is `i + 1`, `r` is the input string, `i` is `i + 1`**

Explanation: The code snippet provided does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `prev`, `v2`, `r`, or `i` directly. The `sys.stdout.flush()` command is a function call that flushes the output buffer, but it does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the only change is that `kp` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
