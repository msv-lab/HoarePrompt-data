Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `g` is 0; `v1` is `i` if `r` equals `'<'`, otherwise `v1` remains 0; `prev` is the last `i` for which `r` was `'>'` or `r` was `'='` and `r2` was `'<'`; `kp` is incremented by 1; `v2` is `i`; `r` is the input string.**
