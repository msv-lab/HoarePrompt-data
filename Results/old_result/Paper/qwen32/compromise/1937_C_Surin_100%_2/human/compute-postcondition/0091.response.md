Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `prev` is the last `i` for which `r` was `'>'` or `r` was `'='` and `r2` was `'<'`, `kp` is incremented by 1, `v2` is `i + 1`, `r` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 1`. If `r` is `'<'`, then `v1` is `i + 1`. Otherwise, `v1` remains as it was before the if statement.**
