Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
2. `n` is an integer greater than 1.
3. `g` is 0.
4. `prev` is the last `i` for which `r` was `'>'` or `r` was `'='` and `r2` was `'<'`.
5. `kp` is incremented by 1.
6. `v2` is `i`.
7. `r` is the new input string.
8. `i` is `i + 2`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is using a formatted string to print four values: `v1`, `v1`, `v2`, and `v2`.
- However, the variable `v1` is not mentioned in the initial state. This means `v1` is not defined based on the given information.
- `v2` is defined as `i` in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
Since `v1` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, we will represent it as `v1` in the output.

### Output:
Output: **? v1 v1 [i] [i] (where v1 is an undefined variable and i is the current value of i)**

However, to provide a more precise description, we should assume `v1` is a placeholder for an undefined value. Given the context, we can describe the output as:

Output: **? v1 v1 [i] [i] (where v1 is an undefined variable and i is the current value of i, which is incremented by 2 from its previous value)**

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` or `v1`, we'll stick to the most precise description possible:

Output: **? v1 v1 i i (where v1 is an undefined variable and i is the current value of i)**
