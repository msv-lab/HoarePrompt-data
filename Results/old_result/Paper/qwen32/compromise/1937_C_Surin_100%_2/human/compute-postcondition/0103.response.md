The given code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream. This operation does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `prev`, or `n`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is some value, `prev` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1**.
