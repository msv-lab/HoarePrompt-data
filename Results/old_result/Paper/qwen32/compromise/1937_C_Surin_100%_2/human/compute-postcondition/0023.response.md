Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `i` is defined as `i + 2`. This implies that `i` is being incremented by 2, but without an initial value, we can only say that `i` is set to whatever its previous value was plus 2.
- `n` is an integer greater than `i + 2`. This tells us that `n` is a value larger than the new `i`.
- `v2` is defined as `i + 2`. Since `i` is already `i + 2`, `v2` will be the same as the new value of `i`.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Analysis:
- `v1` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, it will raise a `NameError` if executed as is, since `v1` is being referenced in the print statement but has no value assigned to it.
- `v2` is defined as `i + 2`, which is the same as the new value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, the code will raise a `NameError` because `v1` is used in the print statement without being defined.

However, if we assume there was a typo and `v1` was meant to be `i`, the output would be:
- `v1` would be `i`.
- `v2` would be `i + 2` (which is the same as the new value of `i`).

But since `v1` is not defined, the correct and precise output based on the given information is that a `NameError` will occur.

Since the task specifies to provide the most precise description possible based on the precondition and the precondition does not define `v1`, the output will be an error.

Output: **NameError: name 'v1' is not defined**
