The value of `v2` is assigned the value of `i`. The initial state specifies that `i` is `i + 1`, which means `i` is being incremented by 1 before this assignment. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still an integer greater than `i + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an integer greater than `i + 1`, `v2` is `i + 1`**.
