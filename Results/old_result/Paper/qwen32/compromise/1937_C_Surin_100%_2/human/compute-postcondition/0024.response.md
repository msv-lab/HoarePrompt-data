The provided code snippet contains a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console. However, it does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `i + 2` (This seems like a circular definition, but for the sake of the task, we'll assume `i` is some initial value and the statement means `i` is incremented by 2)
- `n` is an integer greater than `i + 2`
- `v2` is `i + 2`

Since `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values, the values of `i`, `n`, and `v2` remain the same.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` is an integer greater than `i + 2`, `v2` is `i + 2`**
