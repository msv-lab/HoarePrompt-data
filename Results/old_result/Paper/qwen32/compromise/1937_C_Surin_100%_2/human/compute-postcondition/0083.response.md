The code snippet `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Given that `v2` is `i`, `v1` will now also be `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `g` is 0; `v1` is `i`; `prev` is the last `i` for which `r` was `'>'` or `r` was `'='` and `r2` was `'<'`; `kp` is incremented by 1; `v2` is `i`; `r` is the input string and `r` equals `'<'`.**
