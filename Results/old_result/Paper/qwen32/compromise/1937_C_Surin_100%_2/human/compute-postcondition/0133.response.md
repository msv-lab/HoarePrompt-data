The code snippet assigns the current value of `i` to `prev`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 before this assignment, so `prev` will hold the value that `i` had before being incremented. The values of `t`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is some value, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is the value provided by the user, `i` is incremented by 1, `prev` is the previous value of `i` before it was incremented.**
