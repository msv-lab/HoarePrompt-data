The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is some value, `n` is greater than 1, and `r` is the value provided by the user. The value of `prev` is determined by the conditions involving `r` and `r2`, but it does not affect the loop's continuation.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Since `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to have executed at least once, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

State: **`t` is some value, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is the value provided by the user, `i` is incremented by 1**
