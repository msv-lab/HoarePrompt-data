The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 again, and `n` must remain greater than the new value of `i`.

Given that `i` was the last value of the loop variable at the end of the previous iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than `i+1`, `kp` is incremented by 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or `0` if no `'<'` was received), `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is an input string. If `r` equals `'>'`, `prev` is set to `i`. If `r` does not equal `'>'`, `prev` is set to `i` if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise `prev` remains 0. If `r` equals `'='`, `r2` is the new input string, `i` is `i+1`**

To summarize, the only change needed in the state for the loop to execute one more time is incrementing `i` by 1, and ensuring `n` is greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than `i+1`, `kp` is incremented by 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or `0` if no `'<'` was received), `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is an input string. If `r` equals `'>'`, `prev` is set to `i`. If `r` does not equal `'>'`, `prev` is set to `i` if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise `prev` remains 0. If `r` equals `'='`, `r2` is the new input string, `i` is `i+1`**

However, to clearly reflect the start of the next iteration, we should explicitly state the new value of `i`:

State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `kp` is incremented by 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or `0` if no `'<'` was received), `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is an input string. If `r` equals `'>'`, `prev` is set to `i`. If `r` does not equal `'>'`, `prev` is set to `i` if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise `prev` remains 0. If `r` equals `'='`, `r2` is the new input string, `i` is 4** (assuming `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration as an example)

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can generalize it as:

State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than `i+1`, `kp` is incremented by 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or `0` if no `'<'` was received), `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is an input string. If `r` equals `'>'`, `prev` is set to `i`. If `r` does not equal `'>'`, `prev` is set to `i` if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise `prev` remains 0. If `r` equals `'='`, `r2` is the new input string, `i` is `i+1`**
