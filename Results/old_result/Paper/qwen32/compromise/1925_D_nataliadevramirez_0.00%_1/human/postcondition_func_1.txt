The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from the input. For each test case, it processes a number of children (`n`), a number of pairs of friends (`m`), a number of excursions (`k`), and a list of friendships with their respective values. It then calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result returned by `func_1`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without altering the input variables outside of the loop scope.
