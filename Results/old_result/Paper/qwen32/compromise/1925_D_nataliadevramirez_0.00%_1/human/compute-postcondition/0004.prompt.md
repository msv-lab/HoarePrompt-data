You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of children such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, m is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends such that 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), k is an integer representing the number of excursions such that 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^5, and friendships is a list of m lists, where each sublist contains three integers a_i, b_i, f_i representing the indices of the pair of friends and their friendship value such that a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        
        print(result)
        
    #State: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop, and `t` will be 0 (or whatever value it was initialized to before the loop started, if it was used elsewhere). All other variables not mentioned in the loop will remain in their initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts three integer parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of lists `friendships`. The parameter `n` represents the number of children, `m` represents the number of pairs of friends, and `k` represents the number of excursions. Each sublist in `friendships` contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, representing the indices of a pair of friends and their friendship value. The function returns a result based on these inputs, which is not specified in the provided constraints and relationships.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
