Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts three integer parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of lists `friendships`. The parameter `n` represents the number of children, `m` represents the number of pairs of friends, and `k` represents the number of excursions. Each sublist in `friendships` contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, representing the indices of a pair of friends and their friendship value. The function returns a result based on these inputs, which is not specified in the provided constraints and relationships.**
