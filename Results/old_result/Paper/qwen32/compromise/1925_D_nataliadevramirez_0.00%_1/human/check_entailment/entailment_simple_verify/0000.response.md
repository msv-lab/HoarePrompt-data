### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and the program to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
- **n**: Number of children.
- **m**: Number of pairs of friends.
- **k**: Number of excursions.
- **friendships**: List of m tuples (a, b, f) representing pairs of friends and their initial friendship value.

The goal is to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions, considering that the friendship value increases by 1 each time a pair is chosen.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program calculates the result for each friendship pair by multiplying the initial friendship value `f` by the sum of the first `k` natural numbers (`k * (k + 1) // 2`).

This approach assumes that each pair of friends will be chosen `k` times, which is incorrect. The correct approach should consider:
1. The probability of choosing a specific pair of friends in one excursion is `1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`.
2. The expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in `k` excursions is `k / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`.
3. The expected contribution of each friendship pair to the total sum should be `f * (k / (n * (n - 1) / 2))` for the first selection, and the sum of an arithmetic series for subsequent selections.

#### Correct Approach:
The expected contribution of a friendship pair `(a, b)` with initial friendship value `f` to the total sum over `k` excursions can be calculated as follows:
- The probability of selecting this pair in one excursion is `1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`.
- The expected number of times this pair is selected in `k` excursions is `k / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`.
- The expected contribution of this pair to the total sum is the sum of an arithmetic series:
  \[
  \text{Expected Contribution} = f \cdot \left( \frac{k}{n(n-1)/2} \right) + (f+1) \cdot \left( \frac{k}{n(n-1)/2} \right) + \ldots + (f + (k-1)) \cdot \left( \frac{k}{n(n-1)/2} \right)
  \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[
  \text{Expected Contribution} = \left( \frac{k}{n(n-1)/2} \right) \cdot \left( f + (f+1) + (f+2) + \ldots + (f + k - 1) \right)
  \]
  The sum inside the parentheses is the sum of an arithmetic series:
  \[
  f + (f+1) + (f+2) + \ldots + (f + k - 1) = k \cdot f + \frac{k(k-1)}{2}
  \]
  Therefore, the expected contribution is:
  \[
  \left( \frac{k}{n(n-1)/2} \right) \cdot \left( k \cdot f + \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \right)
  \]

#### Original Program's Calculation:
The original program calculates:
\[
f \cdot \left( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \right) \mod (10^9 + 7)
\]
This is incorrect because it does not account for the probability of selecting each pair and the increasing friendship values.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The program incorrectly assumes that each pair of friends will be chosen `k` times and does not account for the increasing friendship values over the `k` excursions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
