Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The main issue lies in the calculation of the expected value and the handling of the friendship values.

The program calculates the result for each friendship pair by multiplying the initial friendship value `f` by the sum of the first `k` natural numbers (`k * (k + 1) // 2`). This approach assumes that each pair of friends will be chosen `k` times, which is incorrect. The actual probability of choosing a specific pair of friends in one excursion is `1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`, and the expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in `k` excursions is `k / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`. Therefore, the expected contribution of each friendship pair to the total sum should be `f * (k / (n * (n - 1) / 2))`.

Additionally, the program does not account for the fact that the friendship values increase by 1 each time a pair is chosen. The expected value calculation should consider the increasing friendship values over the `k` excursions.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3 1 2
1 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- There are 3 children and 1 pair of friends (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1.
- The total number of possible pairs is `3 * 2 / 2 = 3`.
- The probability of choosing the pair (1, 2) in one excursion is `1 / 3`.
- The expected number of times the pair (1, 2) is chosen in 2 excursions is `2 * (1 / 3) = 2 / 3`.
- The expected contribution of the pair (1, 2) to the total sum is `1 * (2 / 3) + 2 * (1 / 3) = 4 / 3`.
- Since there are 3 possible pairs and only one of them is a friend pair, the expected sum of friendship values is `4 / 3`.
- The expected value as a fraction is `4 / 3`, and `p * q^(-1) % (10^9 + 7)` is `4 * 333333336 % (10^9 + 7) = 3`.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
```
333333338
```

The program incorrectly calculates the expected value, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
