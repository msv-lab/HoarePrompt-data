The provided Python code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. This means the variable `a` is updated to hold the new list of integers from the input, while other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the variable `a` was previously a list of integers from an input, but now it is reassigned to a new list of integers from the new input. The other variables (`tc`, `N`, `cnt`, `t`, and `i`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`tc` is `x + 2`, `N` is the new input integer that must be greater than `x + 2`, `a` is the new list of integers from the input, `cnt` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`, `t` is either 0 or 1, and `i` is `N-1`.**
