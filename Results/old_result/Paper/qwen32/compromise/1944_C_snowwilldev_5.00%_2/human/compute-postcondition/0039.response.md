To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `N`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `N` must be greater than 0.
- `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.

The loop is defined as:
```
for i in range(N):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `N-1`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has taken on a value such that the loop has not yet finished.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
4. `N` remains unchanged because it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `N` remains the same.

State at the start of the next iteration:
- `N` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

State: **`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.
