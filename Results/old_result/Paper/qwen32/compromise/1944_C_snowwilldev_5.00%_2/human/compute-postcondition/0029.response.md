To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state step by step:

1. **Initial State Information:**
   - `t` is either 0 or 1, but its value is dependent on the condition `cnt[i] == 1`. If `cnt[i] == 1`, `t` is flipped (1 becomes 0, 0 becomes 1). Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged.
   - `N` is greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `cnt` is a `defaultdict` with default integer value of 0.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).

2. **Key Points:**
   - The value of `t` is not directly relevant to the output of `print(i)`.
   - `N` being greater than 0 indicates that there is at least one element in the list `a`.
   - `cnt` is a dictionary that counts occurrences of some elements, but its exact content is not provided.
   - The value of `i` is incremented by 1 before the print statement.

3. **Determining the Value of `i`:**
   - The initial value of `i` is not explicitly given, but it is incremented by 1 before the `print(i)` statement.
   - Therefore, the value printed will be the initial value of `i` plus 1.

Since the initial value of `i` is not specified, we can denote it as `initial_i`. The value printed will be `initial_i + 1`.

**Output Format:**
Output: **initial_i + 1 (where initial_i is the initial value of i)**

However, since the initial value of `i` is not provided in the problem statement, we can only describe the output in terms of the increment operation.

**Final Output:**
Output: **i (where i is the value after incrementing the initial value of i by 1)**
