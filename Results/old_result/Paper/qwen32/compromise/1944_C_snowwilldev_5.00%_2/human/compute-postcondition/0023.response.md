Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is either 0 or 1.
   - `N` is greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `cnt` is a `defaultdict` with a default integer value of 0. This means that any key that does not exist in `cnt` will have a default value of 0.
   - The count of each `a[i]` in `cnt` is incremented by 1 for all `i` from `t` to `N-1`.
   - If `cnt[i]` equals 1, `t` is updated to 2.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop that increments the counts in `cnt`.
   - The loop starts from index `t` and goes up to `N-1` (inclusive).
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented from `t` to `N-1`, meaning after the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `N`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - When the `print(i)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `i` after the loop has completed.
   - Since the loop increments `i` from `t` to `N-1`, the final value of `i` will be `N`.

Output: **N**
