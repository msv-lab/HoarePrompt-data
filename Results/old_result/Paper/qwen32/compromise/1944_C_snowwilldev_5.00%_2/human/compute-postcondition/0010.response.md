Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `N` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to `t`; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, and the count of each `a[i]` in `cnt` is incremented by 1 for all `i` from `t` to `N-1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, `cnt` will have the count of each integer from the list `a` starting from the `t`-th element up to the `N`-th element incremented by 1. All other variables (`t`, `N`, `a`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions as per the problem statement.
