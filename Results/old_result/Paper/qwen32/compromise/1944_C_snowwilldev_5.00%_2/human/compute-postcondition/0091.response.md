Postcondition: **`tc` is `x + 2`, `N` is an integer greater than `x + 2`, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`, `i` is `N`. If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cnt[i]` is 1, then `t` is incremented by 1.**
