Postcondition: **`t` is either 0 or 1, `N` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, and the count of each `a[i]` in `cnt` is incremented by 1 for all `i` from `t` to `N-1`. If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `t` is 0 and `cnt[i]` is not 0, the program does not break and continues. If `t` is 1, the program does not break and continues.**
