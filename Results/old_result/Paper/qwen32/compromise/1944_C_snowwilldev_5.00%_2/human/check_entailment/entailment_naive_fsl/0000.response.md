Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the optimal MEX score based on the moves of Alice and Bob. Let's analyze why this is the case:

The program attempts to find the smallest non-negative integer that appears either only once in the array or not at all. However, this approach does not account for the optimal strategy of both players.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Optimal Strategy Not Considered**:
   - The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob and does not consider their strategies to maximize or minimize the MEX score, respectively.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX score, so she should aim to add higher numbers to `c` if possible.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX score, so he should aim to prevent Alice from adding higher numbers to `c`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for MEX Calculation**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the smallest number that appears only once or not at all in `a` will be the MEX of `c` after all moves are completed.
   - This is not necessarily true because the order in which numbers are chosen by Alice and Bob affects the final composition of `c`.

### Example Where the Program Fails:
Let's consider the following test case:
```
1
5
0 1 2 2 3
```
- **Optimal Moves**:
  - Alice can choose `3` first, then `2`, then `2` again, and finally `1`.
  - Bob can choose `0` in his turns.
- **Final `c`**:
  - `c = [3, 2, 2, 1]` or any permutation of these elements.
- **MEX of `c`**:
  - The MEX of `[3, 2, 2, 1]` is `0` because `0` is not in `c`.

However, the program will output `1` for this test case because `1` is the smallest number that appears only once in `a`.

### Correct Approach:
The correct approach would involve simulating the game with optimal moves for both players and then calculating the MEX of the final array `c`. This might involve more complex logic, such as using a priority queue or a strategy to track the availability of numbers for Alice and Bob to choose from optimally.

Since the provided program does not handle these aspects correctly, it is incorrect.
