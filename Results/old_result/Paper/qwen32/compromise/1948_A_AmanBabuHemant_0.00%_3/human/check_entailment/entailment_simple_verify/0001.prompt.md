You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: the program will have printed 'NO' or 'YES' followed by a string of '110's for each input `n` depending on whether `n` is odd or even and if the constructed string's length is less than 200. The value of `t` remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Special Characters**: A character in the string is considered special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
2. **Input**: We are given the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, the integer `n` which represents the number of special characters required in the string.
3. **Output**: For each test case, we need to determine if it's possible to construct such a string:
   - If not possible, print `NO`.
   - If possible, print `YES` followed by the constructed string.

### Key Observations:
- For a character to be special, it must be equal to exactly one neighbor. This means that a special character cannot be part of a sequence of the same character (e.g., in "AAA", no character is special).
- The simplest pattern to achieve this is alternating characters, like "ABABAB...". In such a pattern:
  - Every character will be special because it will match exactly one of its neighbors.
  - The number of special characters will be equal to the length of the string minus one (since each character except the first and last will be special).

### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, the integer `n`.
2. **Checking Odd `n`**: The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints `NO`. This is correct because in an alternating pattern (which is the simplest way to achieve the required number of special characters), the number of special characters will always be even (one less than the length of the string).
3. **Constructing the String**:
   - If `n` is even, the program constructs a string `s` using the pattern "110" repeated `n // 2` times.
   - The length of `s` will be `3 * (n // 2)`.
   - The program then checks if the length of `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints `YES` followed by the string `s`.
   - If the length of `s` is not less than 200, it prints `NO`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The constructed string `s` is using "110" which does not meet the problem's requirement of uppercase Latin letters.
- The pattern "110" does not guarantee that the number of special characters will be exactly `n`. In fact, it doesn't guarantee that the number of special characters will be even, as the problem requires.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned, the program is not correct. The constructed string does not meet the problem's requirements, and the logic for constructing the string is flawed.

### Correctness: **False**
