Postcondition: **`s` is the same string provided by user input, `n` is the same length of `s`, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`, and `i` is the index of the first differing character. `x` is not equal to -1, `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`, and `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.**
