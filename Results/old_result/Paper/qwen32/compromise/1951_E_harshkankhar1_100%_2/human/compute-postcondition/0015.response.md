Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `s` is a string provided by user input.
2. `n` is the length of the string `s`.
3. `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`. This means `s[0]` is the first character of the string, and `x` points to the first occurrence of a character that is not `s[0]`.
4. `i` is the index of the first differing character, which is the same as `x` as per the provided information.
5. `x` is not equal to -1, indicating that there is at least one character in the string `s` that is different from `s[0]`.
6. The function `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`. However, this information does not affect the print statement directly.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet simply prints the string `'YES'`. The value of `'YES'` is explicitly given and does not depend on any of the variables `s`, `n`, `x`, or `i`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
