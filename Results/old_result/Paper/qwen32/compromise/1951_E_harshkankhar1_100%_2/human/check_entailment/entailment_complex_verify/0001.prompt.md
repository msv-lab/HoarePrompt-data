You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

- Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
    #The program returns True if the string 's' is a palindrome, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters and returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome; otherwise, it returns `False`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, and x is an integer that is initially set to -1.
def func_2():
    s = input()
    n, x = len(s), -1
    if (func_1(s[0:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES

        #This is printed: 1
        print(s)
        #This is printed: s (where s is the string provided by user input)
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `s` is a string provided by user input, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is -1, and `func_1(s[0:])` returns `True`
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: `s` is the same string provided by user input, `n` is the same length of `s`, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` if such a character exists, otherwise `x` is -1, and `i` is `n` if no differing character is found, otherwise `i` is the index of the first differing character.
    if (x == -1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: `s` is the same string provided by user input, `n` is the same length of `s`, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`, and `i` is the index of the first differing character. `x` is not equal to -1.
    if (func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(2)
        #This is printed: Based on the analysis, the print statement will output the integer `2`.
        #
        #Output:
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
        #This is printed: aaaaa  bbb
    else :
        if (x == 1 or x == n // 2) :

            print(2)
            #This is printed: 2

            #This is printed: the substring from the start of s to the character at index x + 1, followed by a space, and then the substring from the character at index x + 2 to the end of s
        #State: `s` is the same string provided by user input, `n` is the same length of `s`, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`, and `i` is the index of the first differing character. `x` is not equal to -1, and `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`. Additionally, `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, or `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.
    #State: `s` is the same string provided by user input, `n` is the same length of `s`, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`, and `i` is the index of the first differing character. `x` is not equal to -1. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`, then the function proceeds accordingly. Otherwise, if `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`, then `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, or `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a string `s` from user input and checks certain conditions based on the characters in the string and the results of an external function `func_1`. It prints either 'YES' or 'NO' along with additional information depending on these conditions. The function does not return any value (it returns `None`).




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to partition a given string `s` into substrings such that none of the substrings is a palindrome.
- If such a partition exists, we must print "YES", the number of parts `k`, and the parts themselves.
- If no such partition exists, we must print "NO".

### Program Analysis:

#### Function `func_1(s) -> bool`:
- This function checks if the string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
- It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise.

#### Function `func_2()`:
- This function reads a string `s` from the input.
- It checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`.
- If `s` is not a palindrome, it immediately prints "YES", the number of parts as `1`, and the string `s` itself as the partition.
- If `s` is a palindrome, it searches for the first character that differs from the first character of the string.
- If no such character is found (meaning the string consists of the same character repeated), it prints "NO".
- If such a character is found at index `x`, it checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome.
- If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", the number of parts as `2`, and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
- If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it checks if `x` is `1` or `n // 2` (halfway through the string).
- If `x` is `1` or `n // 2`, it prints "NO".
- Otherwise, it prints "YES", the number of parts as `2`, and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Handling of Palindromic Strings**: The program only handles the case where the entire string is a palindrome or where the substring after the first differing character is not a palindrome. It fails to consider other valid partitions for palindromic strings.
2. **Partitioning Logic**: The logic for partitioning palindromic strings is flawed. For example, for a string like "abccba", the program might fail to find a valid partition.
3. **Output Format**: The program does not handle the output format correctly for all cases. For example, it prints an extra space in the partitioned substrings.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is not guaranteed to find a valid partition for all cases, especially for palindromic strings. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
