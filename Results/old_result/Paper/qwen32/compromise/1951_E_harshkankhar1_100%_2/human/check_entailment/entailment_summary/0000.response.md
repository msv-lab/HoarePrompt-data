### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of the functions.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles the core logic for the problem.
   - It reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`. If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", followed by the number of parts (which is 1 in this case), and the string `s` itself.
   - If `s` is a palindrome, it searches for the first character in `s` that is different from the first character (`s[0]`). If such a character is found (at index `x`), it checks if the substring starting from `x + 1` is not a palindrome.
     - If the substring `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", followed by the number of parts (which is 2 in this case), and the two parts: `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
     - If no such character is found (meaning all characters in `s` are the same), it prints "NO".
     - If the substring `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome and `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, it prints "NO".
     - Otherwise, it prints "YES", followed by the number of parts (which is 2 in this case), and the two parts: `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.

### Analysis:

- The function `func_2` correctly handles the case where the entire string `s` is not a palindrome by printing "YES" and the string itself.
- If the string `s` is a palindrome, the function looks for the first differing character and checks the substring starting from the next character. If this substring is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the two parts.
- If all characters in `s` are the same, it correctly prints "NO" because all possible substrings will be palindromes.
- The function also correctly handles cases where the substring `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome and `x` is either 1 or `n // 2` by printing "NO".

### Conclusion:

The program meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly determines whether a string can be partitioned into substrings that are not palindromes and provides the correct output for each test case.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **True**
