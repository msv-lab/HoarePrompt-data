Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` must be greater than 2; `power` is 2.**

Natural Language: The value of `power` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
