To determine the final output state after the loop completes all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop increments `power` by 1 in each iteration until `power` is no longer less than `log2(n)`. This means that `power` will eventually become the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `power` is 2, which means `n` must be greater than 2 but less than or equal to 4.
- After 2 iterations: `power` is 3, which means `n` must be greater than 4 but less than or equal to 8.
- After 3 iterations: `power` is 4, which means `n` must be greater than 8 but less than or equal to 16.

Following this pattern, the loop will continue until `power` is the smallest integer such that `2^power` is greater than or equal to `n`. Therefore, the final value of `power` will be `ceil(log2(n))`.

Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is not yet initialized; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `power` is the smallest integer such that 2^power is greater than or equal to n.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `power` will be the smallest integer that is the ceiling of the base-2 logarithm of `n`. All other variables (`n_cases` and `i`) remain unchanged.
