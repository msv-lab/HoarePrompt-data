Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4.
2. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, starting from 0 for the first iteration.
3. `n` is the integer value provided by the user input.
4. `power` is calculated as `ceil(log2(n)) - 1`.
5. `power` is not equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

### Analysis:
- `n` is an integer provided by user input.
- `power` is calculated using the formula `ceil(log2(n)) - 1`. This means `power` is the highest integer \( k \) such that \( 2^k \leq n \).
- The code snippet prints `2 ** power`, which is \( 2^k \) where \( k \) is the highest integer such that \( 2^k \leq n \).

### Output Explanation:
The value printed will be the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the user-provided integer `n`. This is because `power` is defined as `ceil(log2(n)) - 1`, which gives the exponent of the highest power of 2 that does not exceed `n`.

### Example:
- If `n` is 10, then `log2(10)` is approximately 3.32. `ceil(log2(10))` is 4, so `power` is 4 - 1 = 3. Therefore, `2 ** power` is \( 2^3 = 8 \).
- If `n` is 16, then `log2(16)` is 4. `ceil(log2(16))` is 4, so `power` is 4 - 1 = 3. Therefore, `2 ** power` is \( 2^3 = 8 \), but since `n` is exactly a power of 2, `power` should be adjusted to 4, making `2 ** power` equal to 16.

However, the problem states that `power` is not equal to `n`, so in the case where `n` is a power of 2, `power` would be `log2(n) - 1`, and `2 ** power` would be the next lower power of 2.

### Final Output:
Given the conditions, the output will be the highest power of 2 that is strictly less than `n`.

Output: **2 ** power (where power is the highest integer k such that 2^k < n)**
