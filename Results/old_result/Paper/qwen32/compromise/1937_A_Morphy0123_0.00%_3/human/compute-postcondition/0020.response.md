Postcondition: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is not yet initialized; `n` is an integer. If `n` is 1, the program does not modify any variables. Otherwise, `n` is an integer greater than 1, and `power` is the largest integer such that 2^(`power` + 1) is greater than or equal to `n`. If `power` was originally equal to `n`, then `power` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `power` is decremented by 1.**
