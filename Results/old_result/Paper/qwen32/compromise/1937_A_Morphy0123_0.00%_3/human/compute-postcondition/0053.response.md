The code snippet provided decrements the value of `power` by 1. Therefore, the value of `power` will be reduced by 1 from its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Given the initial state, `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\). After decrementing `power`, it will no longer satisfy the condition \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\).

Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` remains unchanged; `power` is the smallest integer such that 2^power ≥ n minus 1; `power` is not equal to `n`**.
