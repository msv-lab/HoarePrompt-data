The code snippet initializes a variable named `power` with the value 1. None of the other variables (`n_cases`, `i`, `n`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initialization of `power` while keeping the preconditions for `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` unchanged.

Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is not yet initialized; `n` is an input integer, and `n` is not equal to 1; `power` is 1.**
