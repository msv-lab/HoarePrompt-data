Postcondition: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is not yet initialized; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `power` is the smallest integer such that 2^power is greater than or equal to `n`. If `power` was originally equal to `n`, then `power` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `power` is decremented by 1, making it the largest integer such that 2^(`power` + 1) is greater than or equal to `n`.**
