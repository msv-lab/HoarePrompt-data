In the provided for loop, the only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n_cases`. The loop will execute as long as `n_cases` is greater than 0 because `range(n_cases)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n_cases - 1`. 

Given that `n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases with the constraint 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4, the loop will definitely execute at least once as long as `n_cases` is within this range. The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range` function in the loop head.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `n_cases` is within the specified range. Since the problem specifies that `n_cases` is already an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, no adjustment to `n_cases` is necessary. However, to explicitly state the condition for the loop to execute, we can say `n_cases` must be at least 1.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4, `i` is not yet initialized**
