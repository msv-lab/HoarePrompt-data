Postcondition: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, starting from 0 for the first iteration; `n` is the integer value provided by the user input; `power` is the ceiling of the base-2 logarithm of `n`. If `power` equals `n`, then `power` remains `n`. Otherwise, `power` is set to `ceil(log2(n)) - 1`.**
