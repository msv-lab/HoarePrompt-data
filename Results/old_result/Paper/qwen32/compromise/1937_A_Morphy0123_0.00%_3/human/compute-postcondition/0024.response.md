Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, starting from 0 for the first iteration; `n` is the integer value provided by the user input; `power` is 1.**

Natural Language: The variable `power` has been set to 1. The values of `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
