Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4.
2. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value (though `i` is not used in the provided print statement, it's mentioned for context).
3. `n` remains unchanged (the value of `n` is not specified, but it is a constant for the purposes of this problem).
4. `power` is the smallest integer such that 2^power ≥ n.
5. The current value of `power` is equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

### Analysis:
- `power` is explicitly stated to be equal to `n`.
- The expression `2 ** power` will therefore be `2 ** n`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the value of 2 raised to the power of `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2 ** n (where n is the given constant value)**

However, since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we will describe it in terms of `n`.

Output: **2 ** n**
