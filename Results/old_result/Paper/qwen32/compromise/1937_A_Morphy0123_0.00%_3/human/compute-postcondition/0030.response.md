Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, starting from 0 for the first iteration; `n` must be greater than 8; `power` is 4.**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
