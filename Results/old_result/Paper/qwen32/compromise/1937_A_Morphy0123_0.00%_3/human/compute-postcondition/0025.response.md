To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to execute, we need to focus on the condition `power < log2(n)`. The variables `power` and `n` are the ones that influence whether the loop will execute.

Here's the analysis:

- `power` is initialized to 1.
- `n` is an integer provided by the user input.

The loop will execute if `power < log2(n)`. Given that `power` starts at 1, for the loop to execute, `log2(n)` must be greater than 1. This implies that `n` must be greater than 2 (since `log2(2) = 1`).

Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, starting from 0 for the first iteration; `n` must be greater than 2; `power` is 1.**
