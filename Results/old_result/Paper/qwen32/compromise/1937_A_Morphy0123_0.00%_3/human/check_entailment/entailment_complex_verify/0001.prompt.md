You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), representing the length of the array a.

    #State: `n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is equal to `n_cases` after all iterations have completed; for each of the `n_cases` iterations, the program has read an integer `n` from the input, and printed `2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a single integer `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the position of the element `1` in the array after performing a series of swap operations defined by the problem statement. The swaps are performed in a specific order based on the divisors of each index.

### Given Program:
```python
from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Handling Single Element Case:**
   - If `n == 1`, the array is `[1]` and no operations are performed. The position of `1` is `1`. This is correctly handled by the program.

2. **For `n > 1`:**
   - The program calculates the highest power of `2` that is less than or equal to `n` using a while loop.
   - It starts with `power = 1` and increments it until `2 ** power` is greater than `n`.
   - The final value of `power` is such that `2 ** power` is the largest power of `2` less than or equal to `n`.
   - The program then prints `2 ** power`.

### Correctness of the Program:
- **Mathematical Insight:**
  - The position of `1` after all the swaps is given by the largest power of `2` less than or equal to `n`. This is because the swaps effectively move `1` to the position of the largest power of `2` that is less than or equal to `n`.
  - For example, if `n = 4`, the largest power of `2` less than or equal to `4` is `4` itself, and the position of `1` is `4`.
  - If `n = 5`, the largest power of `2` less than or equal to `5` is `4`, and the position of `1` is `4`.

- **Program Logic:**
  - The program correctly calculates the largest power of `2` less than or equal to `n` using a while loop and prints `2 ** power`.
  - However, there is a logical error in the condition `if power == n:`. This condition will never be true because `power` is an integer representing the exponent, not the power of `2` itself.
  - The correct approach is to directly print `2 ** power` after the while loop.

### Conclusion:
The program is almost correct but contains a logical error in the condition `if power == n:`. This condition is unnecessary and can be removed. The core logic of calculating the largest power of `2` less than or equal to `n` is correct.

However, since the given program has a logical error that does not affect the output for the provided test cases but could potentially cause issues for other inputs, we should consider it incorrect in its current form.

Correctness: **False**
