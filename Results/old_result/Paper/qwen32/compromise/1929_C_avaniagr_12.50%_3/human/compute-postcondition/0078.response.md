Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers provided in the input. If `x < k - 1`, the condition `a >= x + 1` is checked, but the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged regardless of whether the condition is met. If `x == k - 1`, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged. If `x > k - 1`, `z` is calculated as \((x + 1) + \frac{(k-1) \left(1 - \left(\frac{1}{k-1}\right)^{x+1}\right)}{k-2}\) and `i` is set to `x`, while the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged.**
