The `print('YES')` statement will execute and print the string 'YES'. 

The initial state provides conditions and relationships between the variables `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`, but it does not affect the content of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is straightforward and outputs the literal string 'YES', regardless of the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`.

Output: **YES**
