The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the range specified, which is `x + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `x + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be less than `x + 1`. However, since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, the loop will terminate when `i` reaches `x + 1`. Therefore, to start the next iteration, `i` should be incremented to the next value it would take in the sequence, which is `i + 1`.

However, since the loop has just finished an iteration where `i` was `x + 1`, the loop will not execute again because `i` is no longer less than `x + 1`. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which would be the start of a new loop if the loop were to continue) would have `i` incremented to `x + 2`, but since the loop has terminated, we represent the state just after the loop has finished.

State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are the integers provided in the input with `x` >= `k - 1` and `x` != `k - 1`; `z` is 2 or 3 depending on whether `k - 1` is 1 or greater than 1; `i` is `x + 2`**.

But since the loop has terminated, we should represent the state just after the loop has finished with `i` being `x + 1`.
