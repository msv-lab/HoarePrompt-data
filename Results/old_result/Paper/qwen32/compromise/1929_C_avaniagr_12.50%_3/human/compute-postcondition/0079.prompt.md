Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are as initially described.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x < k - 1:
        if a >= x + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    elif x == k - 1:
        if a >= x + 3:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        z = 0
        for i in range(x + 1):
            z += z // (k - 1) + 1
        if a >= z:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer input such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers provided in the input. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then no specific change is described for `x` or `a` unless `a` is less than `x + 1`. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then `a` is either greater than or equal to `x + 3` or less than or equal to `x + 2`. Otherwise, `z` is `x + 1` if `k - 1` is 1, otherwise `z` is a value determined by the loop's iterative process, and `a` is either greater than or equal to `z` or less than `z`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer input such that 0 <= t < 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers provided in the input. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, no specific change is described for `x` or `a` unless `a` is less than `x + 1`. If `a` is less than `x + 1`, the else part applies, but since both parts describe the same conditions and updates for `k`, `x`, and `a`, no change occurs. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then `a` is either greater than or equal to `x + 3` or less than or equal to `x + 2`. If `x` is greater than `k - 1`, `z` is `x + 1` if `k - 1` is 1, otherwise `z` is a value determined by the loop's iterative process, and `a` is either greater than or equal to `z` or less than `z`. The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` have been updated to the values provided in the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t - 1`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers provided in the input. If `x < k - 1`, the condition `a >= x + 1` is checked, but the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged regardless of whether the condition is met. If `x == k - 1`, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged. If `x > k - 1`, `z` is calculated as \((x + 1) + \frac{(k-1) \left(1 - \left(\frac{1}{k-1}\right)^{x+1}\right)}{k-2}\) and `i` is set to `x`, while the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
