The given initial state describes the values and relationships of several variables (`t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`). However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the specific values of these variables. The code simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Let's break it down:
- `t` is an integer input such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers provided in the input.
- The current value of `x` is equal to `k - 1`.
- The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`.

Despite these details about the variables, the `print('YES')` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **YES**
