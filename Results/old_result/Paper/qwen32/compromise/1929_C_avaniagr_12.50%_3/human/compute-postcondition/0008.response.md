Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers provided in the input. The current value of `x` is less than `k - 1`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, then no specific change is described for `x` or `a`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 1`.**
