Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 0 <= t < 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers provided in the input with `x` being at least 0; `z` is 3 + z // (k - 1); `i` is x + 1`**

Natural language: The value of `z` has been updated to `3 + z // (k - 1)`. The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
