The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns this list of integers to the variable `l`. The variables `t`, `n`, `p`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i`; `x` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
