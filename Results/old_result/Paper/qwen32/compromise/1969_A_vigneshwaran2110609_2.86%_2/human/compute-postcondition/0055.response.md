Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `x` is greater than 0, `n` is the old `x`, `l` is a new list of integers from the input. If `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to `flag` and the loop or if statement does not break.**
