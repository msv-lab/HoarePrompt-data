Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i`; `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 0; `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1`**
