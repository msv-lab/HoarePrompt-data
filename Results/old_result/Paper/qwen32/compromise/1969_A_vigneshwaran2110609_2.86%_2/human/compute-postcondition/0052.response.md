The code snippet provided only initializes the variable `flag` to `True` and does not affect the values of `i`, `x`, `n`, or `l`. Therefore, the values of `i`, `x`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is greater than 0, `n` is the old `x`, `l` is a new list of integers from the input, `flag` is True**.
